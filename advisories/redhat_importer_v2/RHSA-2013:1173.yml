summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream Control
  Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled duplicate cookies. If a
  local user queried SCTP connection information at the same time a remote
  attacker has initialized a crafted SCTP connection to the system, it could
  trigger a NULL pointer dereference, causing the system to crash.
  (CVE-2013-2206, Important)

  * It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-3552 released via RHSA-2012:1304
  introduced an invalid free flaw in the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite
  implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to corrupt
  kernel memory via crafted sendmsg() calls, allowing them to cause a denial
  of service or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2013-2224, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Performance Events implementation.
  On systems with certain Intel processors, a local, unprivileged user could
  use this flaw to cause a denial of service by leveraging the perf subsystem
  to write into the reserved bits of the OFFCORE_RSP_0 and OFFCORE_RSP_1
  model-specific registers. (CVE-2013-2146, Moderate)

  * An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's
  TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
  the system by using sendmsg() with an IPv6 socket connected to an IPv4
  destination. (CVE-2013-2232, Moderate)

  * Information leak flaws in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation
  could allow a local, unprivileged user to leak kernel memory to user-space.
  (CVE-2012-6544, Low)

  * An information leak flaw in the Linux kernel could allow a privileged,
  local user to leak kernel memory to user-space. (CVE-2013-2237, Low)

  This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
