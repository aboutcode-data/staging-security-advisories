summary: |
  An updated firefox package that fixes various security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2008-5500, CVE-2008-5501, CVE-2008-5502, CVE-2008-5511, CVE-2008-5512,
  CVE-2008-5513)

  Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. A
  website containing specially-crafted content could potentially trick a
  Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-5506,
  CVE-2008-5507)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox stored attributes in XML User Interface
  Language (XUL) elements. A web site could use this flaw to track users
  across browser sessions, even if users did not allow the site to store
  cookies in the victim's browser. (CVE-2008-5505)

  A flaw was found in the way malformed URLs were processed by Firefox.
  This flaw could prevent various URL sanitization mechanisms from properly
  parsing a malicious URL. (CVE-2008-5508)

  A flaw was found in Firefox's CSS parser. A malicious web page could inject
  NULL characters into a CSS input string, possibly bypassing an
  application's script sanitization routines. (CVE-2008-5510)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
  security advisories for Firefox 3.0.5. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section.

  Note: after the errata packages are installed, Firefox must be restarted
  for the update to take effect.

  All firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches that correct these issues.
