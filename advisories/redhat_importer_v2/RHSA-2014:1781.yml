summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, multiple
  bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
  Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
  orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
  networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

  A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
  VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
  unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
  repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
  VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

  CVE-2014-2573, the fix for which was provided with the initial release of
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6, describes a flaw in the nova VMware driver. An authenticated user
  could exceed their quota by placing an image into rescue and then deleting
  it, causing the rescue image to be left behind.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-2573 was incomplete. A virtual
  machine could be forced into the ERROR state from rescue by issuing a
  suspend command. Virtual machines deleted from the ERROR state would still
  leave the rescue image behind, allowing a user to exceed their quota. Note
  that only setups using the nova VMware driver were affected.
  (CVE-2014-3608)

  The CVE-2014-3608 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. (BZ#1149749)

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
