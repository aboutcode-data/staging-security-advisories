summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix three security issues and one bug
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
  Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
  orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
  networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

  A flaw was found in the way the libvirt driver handled short-lived disk
  back-up files on Compute nodes. An authenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to create a large number of such files, exhausting all available space
  on Compute node disks, and potentially causing a denial of service.
  Note that only Compute setups using the libvirt driver were affected.
  (CVE-2013-7048)

  It was discovered that the libvirt driver did not properly handle live
  migration of virtual machines. An authenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to gain access to a snapshot of a migrated virtual machine. Note that
  only setups using KVM live block migration were affected. (CVE-2013-7130)

  It was found that OpenStack Compute did not properly reapply existing
  security groups after migrating or resizing a virtual machine. This could
  cause virtual machine instances to be unintentionally exposed on the
  network. Note that only setups using the XenAPI back end were affected.
  (CVE-2013-4497)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting
  CVE-2013-7130. Upstream acknowledges Loganathan Parthipan as the original
  reporter of CVE-2013-7130.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, the cache mechanism did not consider existing
  network interfaces when building the nework list. After any change in the
  network interfaces, only the interface modified last was shown when listing
  or getting the details of an instance. With this update, the cache
  mechanism considers all existing instances when it is being refreshed.
  (BZ#1038239)

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues.
