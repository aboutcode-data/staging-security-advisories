  - CVE-2013-4397
summary: |
  An updated libtar package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libtar package contains a C library for manipulating tar archives. The
  library supports both the strict POSIX tar format and many of the commonly
  used GNU extensions.

  Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libtar handled
  certain archives. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
  archive, it could cause the libtar executable or an application using
  libtar to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-4397)

  Note: This issue only affected 32-bit builds of libtar.

  Red Hat would like to thank Timo Warns for reporting this issue.

  All libtar users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
