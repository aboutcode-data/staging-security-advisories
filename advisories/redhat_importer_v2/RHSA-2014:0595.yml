  - CVE-2014-3466
summary: |
  Updated gnutls packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
  messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
  to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
  overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
  the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2014-3466)

  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon as the original
  reporter.

  Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. For the update to take effect, all applications linked
  to the GnuTLS library must be restarted.
