summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.4 that
  fixes multiple security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was discovered that JBoss Web did not limit the length of chunk sizes
  when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to perform a denial of service attack against JBoss Web by streaming an
  unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server
  resources. (CVE-2014-0075)

  It was found that JBoss Web did not check for overflowing values when
  parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a JBoss Web server
  located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header
  correctly. (CVE-2014-0099)

  It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet
  implementation in JBoss Web allowed the definition of XML External Entities
  (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to
  circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive
  information. (CVE-2014-0096)

  It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a
  malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by JBoss Web to
  process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library
  descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML
  parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities
  and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications
  deployed on the same JBoss Web instance. (CVE-2014-0119)

  The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.4 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
