  - CVE-2003-0107
summary: "Updated zlib packages are now available which fix a buffer overflow\nvulnerability.\n\
  \nZlib is a general-purpose, patent-free, lossless data compression\nlibrary used by many\
  \ different programs.\n\nThe function gzprintf within zlib, when called with a string longer\
  \ than\nZ_PRINTF_BUFZISE (= 4096 bytes), can overflow without giving a warning. \n\nzlib-1.1.4\
  \ and earlier exhibit this behavior. There are no known exploits\nof the gzprintf overrun,\
  \ and only a few programs, including rpm2html\nand gimp-print, are known to use the gzprintf\
  \ function.\n\nThe problem has been fixed by checking the length of the output string\nwithin\
  \ gzprintf."
