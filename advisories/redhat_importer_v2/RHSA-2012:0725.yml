summary: |
  JBoss Operations Network 3.1.0, which fixes one security issue, several
  bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution
  that provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor
  JBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss ON 3.1.0 release serves as a replacement for JBoss ON 3.0.1, and
  includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss ON 3.1.0
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes. The
  Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
  SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
  Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
  hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON
  installation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,
  the JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.1.0.
