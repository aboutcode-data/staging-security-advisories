summary: |
  An updated jbossweb package that fixes various security issues is now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) 4.2 and
  4.3.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  JBoss Web Server (jbossweb) is an enterprise ready web server designed for
  medium and large applications, is based on Apache Tomcat, and is embedded
  into JBoss Application Server. It provides organizations with a single
  deployment platform for JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet
  technologies, Microsoft® .NET, PHP, and CGI.

  A traversal vulnerability was discovered when using a RequestDispatcher
  in combination with a servlet or JSP. A remote attacker could utilize a
  specially-crafted request parameter to access protected web resources.
  (CVE-2008-2370)

  An additional traversal vulnerability was discovered when the
  "allowLinking" and "URIencoding" settings were activated. A remote attacker
  could use a UTF-8-encoded request to extend their privileges and obtain
  local files accessible to the jbossweb process. (CVE-2008-2938)

  Users of jbossweb should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
