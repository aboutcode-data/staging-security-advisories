summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and a bug in the Red Hat\nEnterprise\
  \ Linux 4 kernel are now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions\
  \ of the operating system.\n\nThese new kernel packages contain fixes for two security issues:\n\
  \n* a flaw in the key serial number collision avoidance algorithm of the\nkeyctl subsystem\
  \ that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service\n(CVE-2007-0006, Important)\n\n*\
  \ a flaw in the file watch implementation of the audit subsystems that\nallowed a local user\
  \ to cause a denial of service (panic). To exploit this\nflaw a privileged user must have\
  \ previously created a watch for a file \n(CVE-2007-0001, Moderate)\n\nIn addition to the\
  \ security issues described above, a fix for the SCTP\nsubsystem to address a system crash\
  \ which may be experienced in Telco\nenvironments has been included.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels to\nthe packages associated with their\
  \ machine architecture and configurations\nas listed in this erratum."
