summary: "Updated Sendmail packages are available to fix a vulnerability that\nallows local\
  \ and possibly remote attackers to gain root privileges.\n\nSendmail is a widely used Mail\
  \ Transport Agent (MTA) which is included\nin all Red Hat Linux distributions.\n\nThere is\
  \ a vulnerability in Sendmail versions prior to and including \n8.12.8. The address parser\
  \ performs insufficient bounds checking in certain\nconditions due to a char to int conversion,\
  \ making it possible for an\nattacker to take control of the application.  Although no exploit\
  \ currently\nexists, this issue is probably locally exploitable and may also be remotely\n\
  exploitable.\n\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing a\nbackported\
  \ patch which corrects these vulnerabilities.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Michal Zalewski\
  \ for finding and reporting this\nissue."
