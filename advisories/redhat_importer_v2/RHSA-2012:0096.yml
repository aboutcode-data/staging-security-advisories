  - CVE-2010-4820
summary: |
  Updated ghostscript packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript interpreter, a
  set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library, which implements the graphics
  capabilities in the PostScript language) and an interpreter for Portable
  Document Format (PDF) files.

  Ghostscript included the current working directory in its library search
  path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the "-P-" option in an
  attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript
  library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript
  code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working
  directory for library files by default. (CVE-2010-4820)

  Note: The fix for CVE-2010-4820 could possibly break existing
  configurations. To use the previous, vulnerable behavior, run Ghostscript
  with the "-P" option (to always search the current working directory
  first).

  A flaw was found in the way Ghostscript interpreted PostScript Type 1 and
  PostScript Type 2 font files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
  PostScript Type 1 or PostScript Type 2 font file that, when interpreted,
  could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2010-4054)

  Users of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
