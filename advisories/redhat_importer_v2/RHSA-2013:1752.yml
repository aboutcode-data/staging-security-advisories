  - CVE-2013-4485
summary: |
  Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  It was discovered that the 389 Directory Server did not properly handle
  certain Get Effective Rights (GER) search queries when the attribute list,
  which is a part of the query, included several names using the '@'
  character. An attacker able to submit search queries to the 389 Directory
  Server could cause it to crash. (CVE-2013-4485)

  All 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically.
