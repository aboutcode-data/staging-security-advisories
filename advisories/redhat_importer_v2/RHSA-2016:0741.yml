summary: |
  An update for openssh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the OpenSSH client did not properly enforce the ForwardX11Timeout setting. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2015-5352)

  * A flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled PAM authentication when using privilege separation. An attacker with valid credentials on the system and able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could use this flaw to authenticate as other users. (CVE-2015-6563)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in OpenSSH. An attacker able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could possibly cause sshd to crash or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2015-6564)

  * An access flaw was discovered in OpenSSH; the OpenSSH client did not correctly handle failures to generate authentication cookies for untrusted X11 forwarding. A malicious or compromised remote X application could possibly use this flaw to establish a trusted connection to the local X server, even if only untrusted X11 forwarding was requested. (CVE-2016-1908)
