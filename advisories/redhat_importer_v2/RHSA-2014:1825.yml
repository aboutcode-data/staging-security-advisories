  - CVE-2014-8626
summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the xmlrpc
  extension parsed dates in the ISO 8601 format. A specially crafted XML-RPC
  request or response could possibly cause a PHP application to crash or
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that PHP
  application. (CVE-2014-8626)

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
