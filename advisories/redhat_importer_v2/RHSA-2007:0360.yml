summary: "Updated jbossas packages that fix multiple security issues in tomcat are\nnow available\
  \ for Red Hat Application Stack.\n\nThis update has been rated as having Important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nTomcat is a servlet container for Java\
  \ Servlet and JavaServer Pages\ntechnologies.\n\nThis update addresses the following issues:\n\
  \nTomcat was found to accept multiple content-length headers in a\nrequest. This could allow\
  \ attackers to poison a web-cache, bypass web\napplication firewall protection, or conduct\
  \ cross-site scripting attacks. \n(CVE-2005-2090)\n\nTomcat permitted various characters as\
  \ path delimiters. If Tomcat was used\nbehind certain proxies and configured to only proxy\
  \ some contexts, an\nattacker could construct an HTTP request to work around the context\n\
  restriction and potentially access non-proxied content. (CVE-2007-0450)\n\nUsers should upgrade\
  \ to these erratum packages, which contain an update to\njbossas to include a version of Tomcat\
  \ that resolves these issues.  Updated\njakarta-commons-modeler packages are also included\
  \ which correct a bug when\nused with Tomcat 5.5.23."
