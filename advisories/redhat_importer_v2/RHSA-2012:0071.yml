summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix several security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  It was found that the hashing routine used by PHP arrays was susceptible
  to predictable hash collisions. If an HTTP POST request to a PHP
  application contained many parameters whose names map to the same hash
  value, a large amount of CPU time would be consumed. This flaw has been
  mitigated by adding a new configuration directive, max_input_vars, that
  limits the maximum number of parameters processed per request. By
  default, max_input_vars is set to 1000. (CVE-2011-4885)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the PHP exif extension. On 32-bit
  systems, a specially-crafted image file could cause the PHP interpreter to
  crash or disclose portions of its memory when a PHP script tries to extract
  Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata from the image file.
  (CVE-2011-4566)

  An insufficient input validation flaw, leading to a buffer over-read, was
  found in the PHP exif extension. A specially-crafted image file could cause
  the PHP interpreter to crash when a PHP script tries to extract
  Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata from the image file.
  (CVE-2011-0708)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the PHP calendar extension. A remote
  attacker able to make a PHP script call SdnToJulian() with a large value
  could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2011-1466)

  An off-by-one flaw was found in PHP. If an attacker uploaded a file with a
  specially-crafted file name it could cause a PHP script to attempt to write
  a file to the root (/) directory. By default, PHP runs as the "apache"
  user, preventing it from writing to the root directory. (CVE-2011-2202)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4885. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4885.

  All php users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
