summary: "Updated libpng packages are available that fix a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\n\
  [Updated 15 Jan 2003]\nAdvisory updated to include libpng10 packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0.\
  \ \nlibpng10 contains compatibility libraries used to run binaries that were\nlinked dynamically\
  \ with libpng 1.0.x.\n\nThe libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and\n\
  manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files. PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics\
  \ format similar to the GIF format. \n\nUnpatched versions of libpng 1.2.1 and earlier do\
  \ not correctly calculate\noffsets, which leads to a buffer overflow and the possibility of\
  \ arbitrary\ncode execution.  This could be exploited by an attacker creating a\ncarefully\
  \ crafted PNG file which could execute arbitrary code when the\nvictim views it.\n\nPackages\
  \ within Red Hat Linux, such as Mozilla, make use of the shared\nlibpng library. Therefore,\
  \ all users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages.  For Red Hat Linux 8.0 the packages\
  \ contain libpng 1.2.2 which is\nnot vulnerable to this issue.  For Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7,\
  \ 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3\nthe packages contain libpng 1.0.14 with a backported patch that corrects\n\
  this issue."
