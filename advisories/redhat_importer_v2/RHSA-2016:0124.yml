  - CVE-2015-0254
summary: |
  Updated jboss-ec2-eap packages that add one enhancement and resolve one
  security issue are now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.4.6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java EE
  applications. It is based on JBoss Application Server 7 and incorporates
  multiple open-source projects to provide a complete Java EE platform
  solution.

  It was found that the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL) allowed the
  processing of untrusted XML documents to utilize external entity
  references, which could access resources on the host system and,
  potentially, allowing arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2015-0254)

  Note: Tag Library users may need to take additional steps after applying
  this update. Detailed instructions on the additional steps can be found
  here:

  Red Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX, and the Apache Software
  Foundation for reporting the CVE-2015-0254 flaw.

  * The jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic
  Compute Cloud (EC2). With this update, the packages have been updated to
  ensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.4.6.

  All users of EAP 6.4.5 jboss-ec2-eap are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages.
