summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  It was found that a Certificate Authority (CA) issued a fraudulent HTTPS
  certificate. This update renders any HTTPS certificates signed by that
  CA as untrusted, except for a select few. The now untrusted certificates
  that were issued before July 1, 2011 can be manually re-enabled and used
  again at your own risk in Thunderbird; however, affected certificates
  issued after this date cannot be re-enabled or used. (BZ#734316)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves this issue. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
