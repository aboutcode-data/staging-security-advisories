summary: |
  An update for qemu-kvm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Block driver for iSCSI images support (virtio-blk) is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow issue. It could occur while processing iSCSI asynchronous I/O ioctl(2) calls. A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS or potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the Qemu process on the host. (CVE-2016-5126)

  * Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio framework is vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue. It was found that a malicious guest user could submit more requests than the virtqueue size permits. Processing a request allocates a VirtQueueElement and therefore causes unbounded memory allocation on the host controlled by the guest. (CVE-2016-5403)

  Red Hat would like to thank hongzhenhao (Marvel Team) for reporting CVE-2016-5403.
