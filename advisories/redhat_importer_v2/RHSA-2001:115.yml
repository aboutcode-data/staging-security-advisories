  - CVE-2001-1227
summary: |
  New Zope packages are available which fix a security flaw with DTML
  scripting.

  The updated packages include a "hotfix" product which addresses a security
  problem with DTML scripting, as described in the Hotfix_2001-09-28
  README.txt file: "The issue involves the fmt attribute of dtml-var tags.
  Without this correction, Zope does not check security access to methods
  invoked through fmt.  This issue could allow partially trusted users with
  enough knowledge of Zope to call, in a limited way, methods they would not
  otherwise be allowed to access."
