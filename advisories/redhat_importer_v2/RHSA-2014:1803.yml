summary: |
  An updated mod_auth_mellon package that fixes two security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  mod_auth_mellon provides a SAML 2.0 authentication module for the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_auth_mellon's session
  handling that could lead to sessions overlapping in memory. A remote
  attacker could potentially use this flaw to obtain data from another user's
  session. (CVE-2014-8566)

  It was found that uninitialized data could be read when processing a user's
  logout request. By attempting to log out, a user could possibly cause the
  Apache HTTP Server to crash. (CVE-2014-8567)

  Red Hat would like to thank the mod_auth_mellon team for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Matthew Slowe as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-8566.

  All users of mod_auth_mellon are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which contains a backported patch to correct these issues.
