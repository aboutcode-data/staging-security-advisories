summary: |
  Updated kernel packages, based on the 2.4.18 kernel, are now available for
  Red Hat Linux 7.1 for iSeries and pSeries systems.

  Please see the NOTE at the end of the description for important information
  about booting the new kernel on your system.

  The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

  A number of security issues have been found which affect the version of the
  Linux kernel shipped for iSeries and pSeries systems:

  Al Viro found a security issue in the tty layer whereby any user could
  cause a kernel oops. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0247 to this issue.

  Multiple Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC) device drivers do not pad
  frames with null bytes. This allows remote attackers to obtain information
  from previous packets or kernel memory by using malformed packets. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2003-0001 to this issue.

  The kernel module loader allows local users to gain root privileges by
  using ptrace to attach to a child process that is spawned by the kernel.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2003-0127 to this issue.

  A flaw has been found in several hash table implementations in the kernel
  networking code. A remote attacker could send packets with carefully
  chosen, forged source addresses in such a way as to make every routing
  cache entry get hashed into the same hash chain. The result would be that
  the kernel would use a disproportionate amount of processor time to deal
  with new packets, resulting in a remote denial of service attack. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the names CAN-2003-0244 and CAN-2003-0364 to these issues.

  NOTE: Installing the kernel RPMs will not automatically prepare the system
  to boot the new kernel. Refer to the following sections for the appropriate
  instructions to boot the new kernel on your machine.

  Preparing to boot the new kernel on iSeries:

  After the kernel RPM is installed, the new kernel image file is
  /boot/vmlinux. This is a link to the /boot/vmlinux-"version" file (where
  "version" is the new kernel's version-release).

  Use the installkernel.iSeries command to load the new kernel image into the
  "side" from which you want to boot. For instance, to boot from the C side,
  use the command:

  installkernel.iSeries C /boot/vmlinux

  Preparing to boot the new kernel on pSeries:

  After the kernel RPM is installed, the new kernel image file is
  /boot/vmlinux. This is a link to the /boot/vmlinux-"version" file (where
  "version" is the new kernel's version-release).

  Edit the /etc/yaboot.conf file to instruct YABOOT to boot the new
  kernel. Add a new stanza or change the existing stanza to point to
  the new kernel image file. The yaboot.conf man page has detailed
  information about the format of the yaboot configuration file.
