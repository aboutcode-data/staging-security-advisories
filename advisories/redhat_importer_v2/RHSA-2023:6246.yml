  - CVE-2023-36799
summary: |
  An update for .NET 7.0 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The CVE-2023-36799 was previously fixed in .NET 7.0 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via erratum RHSA-2023:5146, which updated .NET to SDK 7.0.111 and Runtime 7.0.11. However, the fix was not included in the upstream SDK 7.0.112 and Runtime 7.0.12, which was added to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via erratum RHSA-2023:5749, introducing a security regression. This erratum re-adds the fix for CVE-2023-36799 to .NET 7.0 packages.

  For more details about the regression, refer to the upstream release notes linked to the References section.

  .NET is a managed-software framework. It implements a subset of the .NET framework APIs and several new APIs, and it includes a CLR implementation.

  New versions of .NET that address a security vulnerability are now available. The updated versions are .NET SDK 7.0.113 and .NET Runtime 7.0.13.
