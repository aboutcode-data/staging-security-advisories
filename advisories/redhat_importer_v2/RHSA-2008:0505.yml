summary: |
  Red Hat Application Stack v2.1 is now available. This update fixes various
  security issues and adds several enhancements.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Red Hat Application Stack is an integrated open source application
  stack, and includes JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP).

  Starting with this update, JBoss EAP is no longer provided via the
  Application Stack channels. Instead, all Application Stack customers are
  automatically entitled to the JBoss EAP channels. This ensures all users
  have immediate access to JBoss EAP packages when they are released,
  ensuring lesser wait for security and critical patches.

  As a result, you must MANUALLY subscribe to the appropriate JBoss EAP
  channel, as all further JBoss EAP updates will only go to that channel.

  This update also entitles all customers to the JBoss EAP 4.3.0 channels.
  Users receive support for JBoss EAP 4.3.0 if they choose to install it.
  Important: downgrading from JBoss EAP 4.3.0 to 4.2.0 is unsupported.

  PHP was updated to version 5.2.6, fixing the following security issues:

  It was discovered that the PHP escapeshellcmd() function did not properly
  escape multi-byte characters which are not valid in the locale used by the
  script. This could allow an attacker to bypass quoting restrictions imposed
  by escapeshellcmd() and execute arbitrary commands if the PHP script was
  using certain locales. Scripts using the default UTF-8 locale are not
  affected by this issue. (CVE-2008-2051)

  The PHP functions htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() did not properly
  recognize partial multi-byte sequences. Certain sequences of bytes could be
  passed through these functions without being correctly HTML-escaped.
  Depending on the browser being used, an attacker could use this flaw to
  conduct cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2007-5898)

  A PHP script which used the transparent session ID configuration option, or
  which used the output_add_rewrite_var() function, could leak session
  identifiers to external web sites. If a page included an HTML form with an
  ACTION attribute referencing a non-local URL, the user's session ID would
  be included in the form data passed to that URL. (CVE-2007-5899)

  It was discovered that the PHP fnmatch() function did not restrict the
  length of the string argument. An attacker could use this flaw to crash the
  PHP interpreter where a script used fnmatch() on untrusted input data.
  (CVE-2007-4782)

  It was discovered that PHP did not properly seed its pseudo-random number
  generator used by functions such as rand() and mt_rand(), possibly allowing
  an attacker to easily predict the generated pseudo-random values.
  (CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108)

  A flaw was found in PHP's CGI server API. If the web server did not set
  DOCUMENT_ROOT environment variable for PHP (e.g. when running PHP in the
  FastCGI server mode), an attacker could cause a crash of the PHP child
  process, causing a temporary denial of service. (CVE-2008-0599)

  MySQL was updated to version 5.0.50sp1a, fixing the following security
  issue:

  MySQL did not correctly check directories used as arguments for the DATA
  DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives. Using this flaw, an authenticated
  attacker could elevate their access privileges to tables created by other
  database users. Note: this attack does not work on existing tables. An
  attacker can only elevate their access to another user's tables as the
  tables are created. As well, the names of these created tables need to be
  predicted correctly for this attack to succeed. (CVE-2008-2079)

  The following packages are updated:

  * httpd to 2.2.8
  * mod_jk to 1.2.26
  * mod_perl to 2.0.4
  * the MySQL Connector/ODBC to 3.51.24r1071
  * the MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver) to 5.0.8
  * perl-DBD-MySQL to 4.006
  * perl-DBI to 1.604
  * postgresql to 8.2.7
  * postgresql-jdbc to 8.2.508
  * postgresqlclient81 to 8.1.11
  * postgresql-odbc to 8.02.0500
