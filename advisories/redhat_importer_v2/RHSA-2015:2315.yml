  - CVE-2015-2924
summary: |
  Updated NetworkManager packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  NetworkManager is a system network service that manages network devices
  and connections.

  It was discovered that NetworkManager would set device MTUs based on MTU
  values received in IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements), without sanity
  checking the MTU value first. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
  create a denial of service attack, by sending a specially crafted IPv6 RA
  packet to disturb IPv6 communication. (CVE-2015-0272)

  A flaw was found in the way NetworkManager handled router advertisements.
  An unprivileged user on a local network could use IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
  ICMP to broadcast a non-route with a low hop limit, causing machines to
  lower the hop limit on existing IPv6 routes. If this limit is small enough,
  IPv6 packets would be dropped before reaching the final destination.
  (CVE-2015-2924)

  The network-manager-applet and NetworkManager-libreswan packages have been
  upgraded to upstream versions 1.0.6, and provide a number of bug fixes and
  enhancements over the previous versions. (BZ#1177582, BZ#1243057)

  Bugs:

  * It was not previously possible to set the Wi-Fi band to the "a" or "bg"
  values to lock to a specific frequency band. NetworkManager has been fixed,
  and it now sets the wpa_supplicant's "freq_list" option correctly, which
  enables proper Wi-Fi band locking. (BZ#1254461)

  * NetworkManager immediately failed activation of devices that did not have
  a carrier early in the boot process. The legacy network.service then
  reported activation failure. Now, NetworkManager has a grace period during
  which it waits for the carrier to appear. Devices that have a carrier down
  for a short time on system startup no longer cause the legacy
  network.service to fail. (BZ#1079353)

  * NetworkManager brought down a team device if the teamd service managing
  it exited unexpectedly, and the team device was deactivated. Now,
  NetworkManager respawns the teamd instances that disappear and is able to
  recover from a teamd failure avoiding disruption of the team device
  operation. (BZ#1145988)

  * NetworkManager did not send the FQDN DHCP option even if host name was
  set to FQDN. Consequently, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) setups failed to update the
  DNS records for clients running NetworkManager. Now, NetworkManager sends
  the FQDN option with DHCP requests, and the DHCP server is able to create
  DNS records for such clients. (BZ#1212597)

  * The command-line client was not validating the vlan.flags property
  correctly, and a spurious warning message was displayed when the nmcli tool
  worked with VLAN connections. The validation routine has been fixed, and
  the warning message no longer appears. (BZ#1244048)

  * NetworkManager did not propagate a media access control (MAC) address
  change from a bonding interface to a VLAN interface on top of it.
  Consequently, a VLAN interface on top of a bond used an incorrect MAC
  address. Now, NetworkManager synchronizes the addresses correctly.
  (BZ#1264322)

  Enhancements:

  * IPv6 Privacy extensions are now enabled by default. NetworkManager checks
  the per-network configuration files, NetworkManager.conf, and then falls
  back to "/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/default/use_tempaddr" to determine and set
  IPv6 privacy settings at device activation. (BZ#1187525)

  * The NetworkManager command-line tool, nmcli, now allows setting the
  wake-on-lan property to 0 ("none", "disable", "disabled"). (BZ#1260584)

  * NetworkManager now provides information about metered connections.
  (BZ#1200452)

  * NetworkManager daemon and the connection editor now support setting the
  Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of a bond. It is now possible to change MTU
  of a bond interface in a GUI. (BZ#1177582, BZ#1177860)

  * NetworkManager daemon and the connection editor now support setting the
  MTU of a team, allowing to change MTU of a teaming interface. (BZ#1255927)

  NetworkManager users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
