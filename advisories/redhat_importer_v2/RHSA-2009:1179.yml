  - CVE-2009-0696
summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 29th July 2009]
  The packages in this erratum have been updated to also correct this issue
  in the bind-sdb package.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message packets
  containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet that could cause named to
  exit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)

  Note: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such
  a specially-crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit
  unexpectedly.

  All BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
  update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.
