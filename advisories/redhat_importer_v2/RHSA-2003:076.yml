  - CVE-2003-0159
summary: |
  Updated ethereal packages are now available which fix a format string
  bug and a heap-based buffer overflow.

  Ethereal is a package designed for monitoring network traffic on your
  system.

  Ethereal 0.9.9 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via carefully
  crafted SOCKS packets.  Red Hat would like to thank Georgi Guninski for
  reporting this issue.

  Additionally, a heap-based buffer overflow in the NTLMSSP code for Ethereal
  0.9.9 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
  possibly execute arbitrary code.

  Users of Ethereal should update to the erratum packages containing Ethereal
  version 0.9.11 which are not vulnerable to these issues.
