  - CVE-2009-2404
summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  Moxie Marlinspike reported a heap overflow flaw in a regular expression
  parser in the NSS library (provided by SeaMonkey) used to match common
  names in certificates. A malicious website could present a
  carefully-crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger the heap
  overflow, leading to a crash or, possibly, arbitrary code execution with
  the permissions of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-2404)

  Note: in order to exploit this issue without further user interaction, the
  carefully-crafted certificate would need to be signed by a Certificate
  Authority trusted by SeaMonkey, otherwise SeaMonkey presents the victim
  with a warning that the certificate is untrusted. Only if the user then
  accepts the certificate will the overflow take place.

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
  packages, SeaMonkey must be restarted for the update to take effect.
