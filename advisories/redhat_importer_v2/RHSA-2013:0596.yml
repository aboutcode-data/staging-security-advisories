summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix multiple security issues,
  various bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat OpenStack
  Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2012.2.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. (BZ#908995)

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  It was found that Keystone failed to properly validate disabled user
  accounts, or user accounts associated with disabled tenants or domains,
  when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) style credentials
  (credentials that are issued in the same format as standard Amazon EC2
  credentials) were in use. Such users could use this flaw to access
  resources they should no longer have access to. (CVE-2013-0282)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
  parser used by Keystone. If a malicious XML file were uploaded for
  processing, it could possibly cause Keystone to consume an excessive amount
  of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

  A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Keystone. If a malicious XML
  file were uploaded for processing, it could cause Keystone to connect to
  external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or allow an
  attacker to read files on the Keystone server that are accessible to the
  user running the Keystone service. (CVE-2013-1665)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Nathanael Burton (National Security Agency)
  as the original reporter of CVE-2013-0282.

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After
  installing the updated packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone)
  will be restarted automatically.
