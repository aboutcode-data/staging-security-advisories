  - CVE-2014-7810
summary: "Updated tomcat6 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Moderate security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\n\
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nApache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer\nPages (JSP) technologies.\n\
  \nIt was found that the expression language resolver evaluated expressions\nwithin a privileged\
  \ code section. A malicious web application could use\nthis flaw to bypass security manager\
  \ protections. (CVE-2014-7810)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously,\
  \ using a New I/O (NIO) connector in the Apache Tomcat 6 \nservlet resulted in a large memory\
  \ leak. An upstream patch has been applied\nto fix this bug, and the memory leak no longer\
  \ occurs. (BZ#1301646)\n\nAll Tomcat 6 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\
  \ which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be\nrestarted for\
  \ this update to take effect."
