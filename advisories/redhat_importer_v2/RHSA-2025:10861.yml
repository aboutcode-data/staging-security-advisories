summary: |
  An update for java-1.8.0-openjdk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit.

  Security Fix(es):

  * JDK: Better Glyph drawing (CVE-2025-30749)
  * JDK: Enhance TLS protocol support (CVE-2025-30754)
  * JDK: Improve scripting supports (CVE-2025-30761)
  * JDK: Better Glyph drawing redux (CVE-2025-50106)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * On certain system configurations where the IPv4 stack was preferred over IPv6 (either due to -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true being specified or no IPv6 interfaces being present), the method java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() would return the fully qualified hostname instead of the short hostname. This behavior was only ever intended for Solaris systems and it deviated from the method's behavior for IPv6 interfaces. In this release, the method will return the short hostname on all interfaces. (RHEL-102903)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
