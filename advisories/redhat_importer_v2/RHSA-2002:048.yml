  - CVE-2002-0167
  - CVE-2002-0168
summary: "Updated imlib packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7,\n7.1 and 7.2 which\
  \ fix potential problems loading untrusted images.\n\nImlib versions prior to 1.9.13 would\
  \ fall back to loading images\nvia the NetPBM package, which has various problems making it\n\
  unsuitable for loading untrusted images. Imlib 1.9.13 also fixes\nvarious problems in arguments\
  \ passed to malloc().\n\nThese problems may allow attackers to construct images that,\nwhen\
  \ loaded by a viewer using Imlib, could cause crashes \nor potentially the execution of arbitrary\
  \ code.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain Imlib 1.9.13.\n\
  \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names\
  \ CAN-2002-0167, CAN-2002-0168 to these issues.\n\n[update May 16 2002]\nThe previous release\
  \ of this errata fixed the aforementioned security\nproblems but had a file descriptor leak\
  \ and a bug which would cause some\napplications (such as the Enlightenment window manager)\
  \ to hang. These\nupdated packages fix these issues."
