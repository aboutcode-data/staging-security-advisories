  - CVE-2008-3655
summary: |
  Updated ruby packages that fix various security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
  object-oriented programming.

  A number of flaws were found in the safe-level restrictions in Ruby. It
  was possible for an attacker to create a carefully crafted malicious script
  that can allow the bypass of certain safe-level restrictions. (CVE-2008-3655)

  A denial of service flaw was found in Ruby's regular expression engine. If
  a Ruby script tried to process a large amount of data via a regular
  expression, it could cause Ruby to enter an infinite-loop and crash.
  (CVE-2008-3443)

  Users of ruby should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
