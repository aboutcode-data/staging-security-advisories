  - CVE-2011-2722
summary: |
  Updated hplip3 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing (HPLIP) provides drivers for
  Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers and multifunction peripherals.

  It was found that the HP CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) fax filter in
  HPLIP created a temporary file in an insecure way. A local attacker could
  use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary
  files accessible to a process using the fax filter (such as the
  hp3-sendfax tool). (CVE-2011-2722)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previous modifications of the hplip3 package to allow it to be installed
  alongside the original hplip package introduced several problems to fax
  support; for example, the hp-sendfax utility could become unresponsive.
  These problems have been fixed with this update. (BZ#501834)

  All users of hplip3 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
