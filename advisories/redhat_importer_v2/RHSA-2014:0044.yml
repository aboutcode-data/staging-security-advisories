  - CVE-2013-6412
summary: |
  Updated augeas packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Augeas is a utility for editing configuration. Augeas parses configuration
  files in their native formats and transforms them into a tree.
  Configuration changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back
  into native configuration files. Augeas also uses "lenses" as basic
  building blocks for establishing the mapping from files into the Augeas
  tree and back.

  A flaw was found in the way Augeas handled certain umask settings when
  creating new configuration files. This flaw could result in configuration
  files being created as world writable, allowing unprivileged local users to
  modify their content. (CVE-2013-6412)

  This issue was discovered by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  All augeas users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  using augeas must be restarted for the update to take effect.
