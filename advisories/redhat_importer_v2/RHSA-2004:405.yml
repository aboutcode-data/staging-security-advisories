summary: "Updated versions of cross-platform Stronghold that fix security issues in\nmod_ssl,\
  \ PHP, and the Apache HTTP Server are now available.\n\nStronghold 4 contains a number of\
  \ open source technologies, including\nPHP, mod_ssl and the Apache HTTP Server.\n\nStefan\
  \ Esser discovered a flaw when the memory_limit configuration setting\nwas enabled in PHP\
  \ 4 versions prior to 4.3.8. If a remote attacker could\nforce the PHP interpreter to allocate\
  \ more memory than the memory_limit\nsetting before script execution begins, then the attacker\
  \ may be able to\nsupply the contents of a PHP hash table remotely. This hash table could\n\
  then be used to execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user. The Common\nVulnerabilities and\
  \ Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0594 to this issue.\n\n\
  It may be possible to exploit this issue if using a non-default PHP\nconfiguration with the\
  \ \"register_defaults\" setting is changed to \"On\".  Red\nHat does not believe that this\
  \ flaw is exploitable in the default\nconfiguration of Stronghold 4.\n\nStefan Esser discovered\
  \ a flaw in the strip_tags function in versions of\nPHP prior to 4.3.8. The strip_tags function\
  \ is commonly used by PHP scripts\nto prevent cross-site scripting attacks by removing HTML\
  \ tags from\nuser-supplied form data. By embedding NUL bytes into form data, HTML tags\ncan\
  \ in some cases be passed intact through the strip_tags function, which\nmay allow a cross-site\
  \ scripting attack. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\
  \ assigned the name CAN-2004-0595 to\nthis issue.\n\nA stack buffer overflow was discovered\
  \ in mod_ssl which can be triggered if\nusing the FakeBasicAuth option. If mod_ssl is sent\
  \ a client certificate\nwith a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters, a stack overflow\
  \ can\noccur if FakeBasicAuth has been enabled. In order to exploit this issue,\nthe carefully\
  \ crafted malicious certificate would have to be signed by a\nCertificate Authority which\
  \ mod_ssl is configured to trust. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0488 to this issue.\n\nA format string issue was discovered\
  \ in mod_ssl which can be triggered if \nmod_ssl is configured to allow a client to proxy\
  \ to remote SSL sites. \nIf mod_ssl is forced to connect to a remote SSL server using a\n\
  carefully crafted hostname, an attacker may be able to crash an Apache\nchild process.  This\
  \ issue is not known to allow arbitrary execution of\ncode.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\
  \ Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0700 to this issue.\n\n\
  A denial of service issue was discovered which affects versions of the\nApache HTTP Server\
  \ prior to 1.3.30.  On some platforms, when Apache is\nconfigured with multiple listening\
  \ sockets, a short-lived connection to\none socket may temporarily block new connections to\
  \ other sockets.  This\nissue does not affect Stronghold if running on Linux, FreeBSD or HP-UX\n\
  platforms.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2004-0174 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are advised\
  \ to update to these errata\nversions, which contain backported security fixes and are not\
  \ vulnerable to\nthese issues."
