  - CVE-2003-0078
summary: "Updated OpenSSL packages are available that fix a potential timing-based\nattack.\n\
  \nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and open source toolkit that \nimplements\
  \ the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols as\
  \ well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library.\n\nIn a paper, Brice Canvel,\
  \ Alain Hiltgen, Serge Vaudenay, and Martin\nVuagnoux describe and demonstrate a timing-based\
  \ attack on CBC ciphersuites\nin SSL and TLS.  An active attacker may be able to use timing\
  \ observations\nto distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and\n\
  MAC verification errors.  Over multiple connections this can leak\nsufficient information\
  \ to make it possible to retrieve the plaintext of a\ncommon, fixed block.\n\nIn order for\
  \ an attack to be sucessful, an attacker must be able to act as\na man-in-the-middle to intercept\
  \ and modify multiple connections, which all\ninvolve a common fixed plaintext block (such\
  \ as a password), and have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to\
  \ be reliably\nobserved.\n\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL\
  \ group that\ncorrects this vulnerability.\n\nBecause server applications are affected by\
  \ these vulnerabilities, we\nadvise users to restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality\
  \ or\nalternatively reboot their systems after installing these updates."
