summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. MySQL is a
  client/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld), and
  many different client programs and libraries.

  A flaw was found in a way MySQL handled symbolic links when database tables
  were created with explicit "DATA" and "INDEX DIRECTORY" options. An
  authenticated user could create a table that would overwrite tables in
  other databases, causing destruction of data or allowing the user to
  elevate privileges. (CVE-2007-5969)

  A flaw was found in a way MySQL's InnoDB engine handled spatial indexes. An
  authenticated user could create a table with spatial indexes, which are not
  supported by the InnoDB engine, that would cause the mysql daemon to crash
  when used. This issue only causes a temporary denial of service, as the
  mysql daemon will be automatically restarted after the crash.
  (CVE-2007-5925)

  All mysql users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
