  - CVE-2015-5279
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's NE2000 NIC
  emulation implementation handled certain packets received over the
  network. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the
  QEMU instance (denial of service) or potentially execute arbitrary code on
  the host. (CVE-2015-5279)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. for reporting
  this issue.

  All users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After
  installing this update, shut down and restart all running virtual machines
  for this update to take effect.
