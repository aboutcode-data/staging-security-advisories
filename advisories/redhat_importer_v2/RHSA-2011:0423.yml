  - CVE-2011-0411
summary: |
  Updated postfix packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Postfix is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), supporting LDAP, SMTP AUTH (SASL),
  and TLS.

  It was discovered that Postfix did not flush the received SMTP commands
  buffer after switching to TLS encryption for an SMTP session. A
  man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to inject SMTP commands into
  a victim's session during the plain text phase. This would lead to those
  commands being processed by Postfix after TLS encryption is enabled,
  possibly allowing the attacker to steal the victim's mail or authentication
  credentials. (CVE-2011-0411)

  Red Hat would like to thank the CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2011-0411. The
  CERT/CC acknowledges Wietse Venema as the original reporter.

  Users of Postfix are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, the postfix service will be restarted automatically.
