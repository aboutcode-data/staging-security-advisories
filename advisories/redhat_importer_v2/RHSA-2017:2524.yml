  - CVE-2017-7481
summary: |
  An update for ansible is now available for RHEV Engine version 4.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node
  deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and
  does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes.
  Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to
  managed machines automatically.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ansible (2.3.1.0). (BZ#1477925)

  Security Fix(es):

  * An input validation flaw was found in Ansible, where it fails to properly mark lookup-plugin results as unsafe. If an attacker could control the results of lookup() calls, they could inject Unicode strings to be parsed by the jinja2 templating system, resulting in code execution. By default, the jinja2 templating language is now marked as 'unsafe' and is not evaluated. (CVE-2017-7481)

  This issue was discovered by Evgeni Golov (Red Hat).
