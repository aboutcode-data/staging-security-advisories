summary: |
  Updated php53 packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
  add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  It was found that PHP did not properly handle file names with a NULL
  character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a PHP
  script access unexpected files and bypass intended file system access
  restrictions. (CVE-2006-7243)

  It was found that PHP did not check for carriage returns in HTTP headers,
  allowing intended HTTP response splitting protections to be bypassed.
  Depending on the web browser the victim is using, a remote attacker could
  use this flaw to perform HTTP response splitting attacks. (CVE-2011-1398)

  A flaw was found in PHP's SSL client's hostname identity check when
  handling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL bytes. If an
  attacker was able to get a carefully crafted certificate signed by a
  trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could use the certificate to
  conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers. (CVE-2013-4248)

  An integer signedness issue, leading to a heap-based buffer underflow, was
  found in the PHP scandir() function. If a remote attacker could upload an
  excessively large number of files to a directory the scandir() function
  runs on, it could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2688)

  It was found that PHP did not correctly handle the magic_quotes_gpc
  configuration directive. This could result in magic_quotes_gpc input
  escaping not being applied in all cases, possibly making it easier for a
  remote attacker to perform SQL injection attacks. (CVE-2012-0831)

  It was found that the PHP SOAP parser allowed the expansion of external XML
  entities during SOAP message parsing. A remote attacker could possibly use
  this flaw to read arbitrary files that are accessible to a PHP application
  using a SOAP extension. (CVE-2013-1643)

  These updated php53 packages also include numerous bug fixes and
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.10 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
  of these changes.

  All PHP users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon must
  be restarted for the update to take effect.
