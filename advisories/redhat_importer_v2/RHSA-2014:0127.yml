  - CVE-2013-1881
summary: |
  Updated librsvg2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  [Updated Feb 4, 2014]
  The original packages distributed with this advisory contained a bug that
  caused applications using librsvg2 to crash when loading certain SVG
  images. We have updated the packages to correct this bug.

  The librsvg2 packages provide an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) library
  based on libart.

  An XML External Entity expansion flaw was found in the way librsvg2
  processed SVG files. If a user were to open a malicious SVG file, a remote
  attacker could possibly obtain a copy of the local resources that the user
  had access to. (CVE-2013-1881)

  All librsvg2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  that use librsvg2 must be restarted for this update to take effect.
