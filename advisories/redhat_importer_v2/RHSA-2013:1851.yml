  An updated Grid component package that fixes multiple security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  5.

  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  [Updated 17 December 2013]
  This erratum previously incorrectly listed RubyGems issues CVE-2012-2125,
  CVE-2012-2126 and CVE-2013-4287 as addressed by this update. However,
  the rubygems component is not included as part of Red Hat Enterprise MRG
  2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and is only included as part of Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG 2.4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. These issues were
  corrected there via RHSA-2013:1852.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
  achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
  utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
  performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
  policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
  management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
  a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
  policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
  upon completion.

  A flaw was found in the way cumin enforced user roles, allowing an
  unprivileged cumin user to access a range of resources without having the
  appropriate role. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
  access privileged information, and perform a variety of privileged
  operations. (CVE-2013-4404)

  It was found that multiple forms in the cumin web interface did not protect
  against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker
  could trick a user, who is logged into the cumin web interface, into
  visiting a specially crafted URL, the attacker could perform actions in the
  context of the logged in user. (CVE-2013-4405)

  It was found that cumin did not properly escape input from the "Max
  allowance" field in the "Set limit" form of the cumin web interface.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks against victims by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted
  URL. (CVE-2013-4414)

  A flaw was found in the way cumin parsed POST request data. A remote
  attacker could potentially use this flaw to perform SQL injection attacks
  on cumin's database. (CVE-2013-4461)

  The CVE-2013-4404, CVE-2013-4405, CVE-2013-4414, and CVE-2013-4461 issues
  were discovered by Tomáš Nováčik of the Red Hat MRG Quality Engineering
  team.

  All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
