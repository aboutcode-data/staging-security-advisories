summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5
  Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation
  handled malformed or duplicate Address Configuration Change Chunks
  (ASCONF). A remote attacker could use either of these flaws to crash the
  system. (CVE-2014-3673, CVE-2014-3687, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation
  handled the association's output queue. A remote attacker could send
  specially crafted packets that would cause the system to use an excessive
  amount of memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3688,
  Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem handled
  reference counting when performing unmount operations on symbolic links.
  A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to exhaust all available
  memory on the system or, potentially, trigger a use-after-free error,
  resulting in a system crash or privilege escalation. (CVE-2014-5045,
  Moderate)

  * An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the lzo1x_decompress_safe()
  function of the Linux kernel's LZO implementation processed Literal Runs.
  A local attacker could, in extremely rare cases, use this flaw to crash the
  system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2014-4608, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin of Parallels for reporting
  CVE-2014-5045, and Don A. Bailey from Lab Mouse Security for reporting
  CVE-2014-4608. The CVE-2014-3673 issue was discovered by Liu Wei of
  Red Hat.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds one enhancement.
  Documentation for these changes is available from the Technical Notes
  document linked to in the References section.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
