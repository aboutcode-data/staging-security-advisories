  - CVE-2008-2383
summary: |
  An updated hanterm-xf package to correct a security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Hanterm is a replacement for xterm, a X Window System terminal emulator,
  that supports Hangul input and output.

  A flaw was found in the Hanterm handling of Device Control Request Status
  String (DECRQSS) escape sequences. An attacker could create a malicious
  text file (or log entry, if unfiltered) that could run arbitrary commands
  if read by a victim inside a Hanterm window. (CVE-2008-2383)

  All hanterm-xf users are advised to upgrade to the updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to resolve this issue. All running instances of
  hanterm must be restarted for the update to take effect.
