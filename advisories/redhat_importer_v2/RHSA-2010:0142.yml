  - CVE-2010-0624
summary: |
  An updated tar package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can
  restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tar expanded archive
  files. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted archive,
  it could cause the tar executable to crash or execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running tar. (CVE-2010-0624)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jakob Lell for responsibly reporting this
  issue.

  Users of tar are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  a backported patch to correct this issue.
