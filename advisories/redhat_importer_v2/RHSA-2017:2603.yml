  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The docker-distribution package provides the tool set to support the Docker Registry version 2.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: docker-distribution (2.6.2). (BZ#1479494)

  Security Fix(es):
