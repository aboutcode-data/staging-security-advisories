summary: "Updated Samba packages are now available to fix security vulnerabilities\nfound during\
  \ a code audit.\n\n[Updated 24 March 2003]\nUpdated Samba packages for Red Hat Linux 6.2,\
  \ 7, and 7.1 are now included.\nThese packages contain Samba version 2.0.10 with a backported\
  \ security fix.\n\n[Updated 1 April 2003]\nUpdated Samba packages for Red Hat Linux 9 are\
  \ now included.  Please note\nthat this issue only affects Red Hat Linux 9 boxed sets manufactured\
  \ for\ndistribution within the United States. The part numbers, which can be\nfound on the\
  \ bottom flap of the box, are RHF0120US and RHF0121US.\nCopies of Red Hat Linux 9 obtained\
  \ through other means (such as from Red\nHat Network, FTP, or international boxed sets) already\
  \ contain the \npackages referenced by this erratum, and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\
  \nSamba is a suite of utilities which provides file and printer sharing\nservices to SMB/CIFS\
  \ clients.\n\nSebastian Krahmer discovered a security vulnerability present\nin unpatched\
  \ versions of Samba prior to 2.2.8. An anonymous user could\nexploit the vulnerability to\
  \ gain root access on the target machine. \n\nAdditionally, a race condition was discovered\
  \ which could allow an attacker\nto overwrite critical system files.\n\nAll users of Samba\
  \ are advised to update to the packages listed in this\nerrata which correct these vulnerabilities."
