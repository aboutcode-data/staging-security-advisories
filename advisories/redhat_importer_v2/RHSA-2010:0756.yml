summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging packages that fix two security
  issues and several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime and Grid) is a real-time IT
  infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG Messaging implements the
  Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) standard, adding persistence
  options, kernel optimizations, and operating system services.

  A flaw was found in the way SSL connections to the MRG Messaging broker
  were handled. A connection (from a user or client application) to the
  broker's SSL port would prevent the broker from responding to any other
  connections on that port, until the first connection's SSL handshake
  completed or failed. A remote user could use this flaw to block connections
  from legitimate clients. Note that this issue only affected connections to
  the SSL port. The broker does not listen for SSL connections by default.
  (CVE-2010-3083)

  A flaw was found in the way the MRG Messaging broker handled the receipt of
  large persistent messages. If a remote, authenticated user sent a very
  large persistent message, the broker could exhaust stack memory, causing
  the broker to crash. (CVE-2010-3701)

  This update also includes a number of MRG Messaging bug fixes, including
  updated qpidc and rhm packages:

  * The Messaging broker failed when first a new durable exchange was
  supplied by a plug-in, and then the broker was restarted. The startup
  sequence has been reordered so that the plug-in modules are loaded before
  the store is recovered. With this update, the new exchange is now
  recognized and recovered successfully and the broker starts up. (BZ#550151)

  * qpid-route could not delete an existing route due to a problem with the
  management object for the bridge. With this update, qpid-route follows the
  normal path. (BZ#560696)

  * Previously, clients connecting over SSL needed to use some other username
  to authenticate themselves to have permission granted via ACLs. This update
  adds the option to use the client identity as authenticated by SSL.
  (BZ#601222)

  * New brokers did not see a durable exchange even though it existed in a
  cluster. This update checks for any durable exchanges to be replicated when
  a new broker is added to the cluster. Now, the exchange is visible on the
  new broker. (BZ#601230)

  * Cluster members occasionally failed when a new member was added to a
  cluster with active consumers, because some of the consumer information was
  not being replicated to new members joining a cluster. With this update,
  the missing information is replicated to new members when joining a
  cluster. (BZ#601236)

  * Performance decreased when reading messages from a queue sequentially
  without taking them off the queue. With this update, the algorithm for
  traversing through messages has been changed, and the next message is found
  more quickly, even for large queues. (BZ#611907)

  * Wire level protocol violation or segmentation faults occurred when adding
  tags due to possible modification of the message concurrent with its
  encoding. This update clones messages before adding tags to prevent
  concurrent modification as they are being delivered and encoded.
  (BZ#619919)

  All Red Hat Enterprise MRG users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the qpidd service must be restarted ("service qpidd restart") for
  this update to take effect.
