  - CVE-2007-4132
summary: |
  Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.0.1 is now available which fixes
  a security issue in version 5.0.0.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  During an internal code audit, a flaw was found in an unused back-end
  XMLRPC handler first added to Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.0.0. A
  remote attacker with valid authentication credentials who was able to
  connect to a Satellite Server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code
  on the server as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2007-4132)

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.0.0 are advised to upgrade to
  5.0.1 which removes the unused, vulnerable handler.

  Note: This issue did not affect the hosted version of Red Hat Network or
  versions of Red Hat Network Satellite Server prior to 5.0.0.
