summary: "Updated XFree86 packages for Red Hat Linux 9 provide security\nfixes to font libraries\
  \ and XDM.\n\nXFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System providing the core\ngraphical\
  \ user interface and video drivers in Red Hat Linux. XDM is the X\ndisplay manager.\n\nMultiple\
  \ integer overflows in the transfer and enumeration of font\nlibraries in XFree86 allow local\
  \ or remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice or execute arbitrary code via heap-based\
  \ and stack-based buffer\noverflow attacks.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n\
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0730 to this issue.  \n\nThe risk to users\
  \ from this vulnerability is  limited because only clients\ncan be affected by these bugs,\
  \ however in some (non-default)\nconfigurations, both xfs and the X Server can act as clients\n\
  to remote font servers.\n\nXDM does not verify whether the pam_setcred function call succeeds,\
  \ which\nmay allow attackers to gain root privileges by triggering error conditions\nwithin\
  \ PAM modules, as demonstrated in certain configurations of the\npam_krb5 module.  The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0690\
  \ to this issue.  \n\nXDM uses a weak session cookie generation algorithm that does not provide\n\
  128 bits of entropy, which allows attackers to guess session cookies via\nbrute force methods\
  \ and gain access to the user session.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0692 to this issue.  \n\nUsers are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated XFree86 4.3.0 packages, which\ncontain backported security patches\
  \ and are not vulnerable to these issues."
