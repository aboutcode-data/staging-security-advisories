  - CVE-2016-4443
summary: "An update for org.ovirt.engine-root is now available for RHEV Manager version 3.6.\n\
  \nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate.\
  \ A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity\
  \ rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\
  \nThe Red Hat Virtualization Manager is a centralized management platform \nthat allows system\
  \ administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The \nManager provides a comprehensive\
  \ range of features including search \ncapabilities, resource management, live migrations,\
  \ and virtual \ninfrastructure provisioning.\n \nThe Manager is a JBoss Application Server\
  \ application that provides several\ninterfaces through which the virtual environment can\
  \ be accessed and \ninteracted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and\
  \ a \nRepresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface \n(API).\n\n\
  Security Fix(es):\n\n* A flaw was found in RHEV Manager, where it wrote sensitive data to\
  \ the engine-setup log file. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive information\
  \ such as encryption keys and certificates (which could then be used to steal other sensitive\
  \ information such as passwords). (CVE-2016-4443)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Simone Tiraboschi\
  \ (Red Hat).\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* With this update, users are now warned to set the system\
  \ in global maintenance mode before running the engine-setup command. This is because data\
  \ corruption may occur if the engine-setup command is run without setting the system into\
  \ global maintenance mode. This update means that the user is warned and the setup will be\
  \ aborted if the system is not in global maintenance mode and the engine is running in the\
  \ hosted engine configuration. (BZ#1359844)\n\n* Previously, the update of the compatibility\
  \ version of a cluster with many running virtual machines that are installed with the guest-agent\
  \ caused a deadlock that caused the update to fail. In some cases, these clusters could not\
  \ be upgraded to a newer compatibility version. Now, the deadlock in the database has been\
  \ prevented so that a cluster with many running virtual machines that are installed with the\
  \ guest-agent can be upgraded to newer compatibility version. (BZ#1369415)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ a virtual machine with a null CPU profile id stored in the database caused a NPE when editing\
  \ the virtual machine. Now, a virtual machine with a null CPU profile id stored in the database\
  \ is correctly handled and the virtual machine can be edited. (BZ#1373090)\n\n* Setting only\
  \ one of the thresholds for power saving/evenly distributed memory based balancing (high or\
  \ low) can lead to unexpected results. For example, when in power saving load balancing the\
  \ threshold for memory over utilized hosts was set with a value, and the threshold for memory\
  \ under utilized hosts was undefined thus getting a default value of 0. All hosts were considered\
  \ as under utilized hosts and were chosen as sources for migration, but no host was chosen\
  \ as a destination for migration.\n\nThis has now been changed so that when the threshold\
  \ for memory under utilized host is undefined, it gets a default value of Long.MAX. Now, when\
  \ the threshold for memory over utilized hosts is set with a value, and the threshold for\
  \ memory under utilized host is undefined, only over utilized hosts will be selected as sources\
  \ for migration, and destination hosts will be hosts that are not over utilized. (BZ#1359767)\n\
  \n* Previously, recently added logs that printed the amount of virtual machines running on\
  \ a host were excessively written to the log file. Now, the frequency of these log have been\
  \ reduced by printing them only upon a change in the number of virtual machines running on\
  \ the host. (BZ#1367519)"
