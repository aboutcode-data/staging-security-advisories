  - CVE-2012-3412
summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue and one
  bug is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP segment
  offloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit within
  the minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could
  repeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service. (CVE-2012-3412)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting
  this issue.

  This updated package provides updated components that include a fix for
  one security issue. This issue had no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fix included in
  this update addresses the following CVE number:

  CVE-2012-4423 (libvirt issue)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * A dependency issue was found between the rhev-hypervisor-tools and
  rhev-hypervisor6-tools packages. Every time a user with one of the -tools
  packages installed ran "yum update", the -tools package they had installed
  was removed and the other one installed. Even though rhev-hypervisor-tools
  obsoleted rhev-hypervisor6-tools, this update includes an updated
  rhev-hypervisor6-tools package that corrects this issue. Note that the
  package does not have meaningful content, is only here to fix the
  dependency issue, and may be removed by a future update. (BZ#855391)

  This update includes the ovirt-node build from RHBA-2012:1374:

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.
