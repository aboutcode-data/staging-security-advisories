  - CVE-2009-3555
summary: |
  Updated openssl097a packages that fix a security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure
  Sockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's
  session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force
  the server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the
  victim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw by implementing the
  TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as defined in RFC 5746.
  (CVE-2009-3555)

  Refer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about
  this flaw: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491

  All openssl097a users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the openssl097a library must be restarted,
  or the system rebooted.
