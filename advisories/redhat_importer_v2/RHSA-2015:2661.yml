summary: |
  Updated Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.2 packages are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the
  Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache
  Tomcat Connector (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster),
  Hibernate, and the Tomcat Native library.

  It was found that Tomcat would keep connections open after processing
  requests with a large enough request body. A remote attacker could
  potentially use this flaw to exhaust the pool of available connections
  and prevent further, legitimate connections to the Tomcat server.
  (CVE-2014-0230)

  A flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when
  processing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could
  use Trailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header
  processing was performed by other modules. This could, for example,
  lead to a bypass of header restrictions defined with mod_headers.
  (CVE-2013-5704)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
  responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could
  use these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd
  would decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it,
  possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

  * This enhancement update adds the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.2
  packages to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. These packages provide a
  number of enhancements over the previous version of Red Hat JBoss Web
  Server. (JIRA#JWS-229)

  Users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which add this enhancement.
