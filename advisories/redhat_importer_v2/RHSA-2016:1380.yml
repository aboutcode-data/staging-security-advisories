  - CVE-2014-7191
summary: |
  An update for nodejs010-node-gyp and nodejs010-nodejs-qs is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Node.js is a software development platform for building fast and scalable network applications in the JavaScript programming language.

  Security Fix(es):

  * The nodejs-qs module has the ability to create sparse arrays during parsing. By specifying a high index in a querystring parameter it is possible to create a large array that will eventually take up all the allocated memory of the running process, resulting in a crash. (CVE-2014-7191)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * A previous patch to the nodejs010-node-gyp RPM package introduced a bug, which caused the node-gyp module to work incorrectly. As a consequence, users were unable to install or build native Node.js modules. A new patch has been applied, the node-gyp module now works as expected, and it no longer affects other modules. (BZ#1255594)

  All nodejs010-nodejs-qs and nodejs010-node-gyp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
