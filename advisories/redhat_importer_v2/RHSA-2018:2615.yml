summary: "An update for collectd is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for Red Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security\
  \ impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives\
  \ a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in\
  \ the References section.\n\ncollectd is a host-based system statistics collection daemon\
  \ that gathers metrics from various sources periodically, such as the operating system, applications,\
  \ log files and devices, and storage clusters. As the daemon does not start up each time it\
  \ updates files, it has a low system footprint.\n\nFor Red Hat Gluster Storage Web Administration\
  \ 3.4, collectd service is responsible for gathering metrics from Red Hat Gluster Storage\
  \ clusters. \n\nThe updated collectd package includes the following security bug fixes.\n\n\
  Security Fix(es):\n\n* collectd: Infinite loop due to incorrect interaction of parse_packet()\
  \ and parse_part_sign_sha256() functions (CVE-2017-7401)\n\n* collectd: double free in csnmp_read_table\
  \ function in snmp.c (CVE-2017-16820)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including\
  \ the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed\
  \ in the References section.\n\nThis updated package contains a number of bug fixes and enhancements,\
  \ which are documented in detail in the Release Notes, linked in the References.\n\nAll users\
  \ of collectd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues."
