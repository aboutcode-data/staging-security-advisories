summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07, which fixes multiple security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  This JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 release serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP06. Refer to the
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 Release Notes, available shortly
  from docs.redhat.com, for information on the most significant bug fixes
  included in this release.

  The following security fixes are also included:

  JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss Expression Language
  (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing arbitrary Java methods
  to be executed. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code via a specially-crafted URL provided to certain applications based on
  the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly configured and enabled Java
  Security Manager would prevent exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)

  Note: If you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy
  of the JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the
  updated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was
  susceptible to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to cause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by
  sending an HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map
  to the same hash value. This update introduces a limit on the number of
  parameters and headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The
  default limit is 512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults
  can be changed by setting the
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "server/$PROFILE/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2011-4858)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way JBoss Web handled HTTP DIGEST
  authentication. These flaws weakened the JBoss Web HTTP DIGEST
  authentication implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of
  HTTP BASIC authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to
  perform session replay attacks. (CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-5062,
  CVE-2011-5063, CVE-2011-5064)

  The invoker servlets, deployed by default via httpha-invoker, only
  performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST methods, allowing remote
  attackers to make unauthenticated requests by using different HTTP methods.
  Due to the second layer of authentication provided by a security
  interceptor, this issue is not exploitable on default installations unless
  an administrator has misconfigured the security interceptor or disabled it.
  (CVE-2011-4085)

  A flaw was found in the way JBoss Web handled sendfile request attributes
  when using the HTTP APR (Apache Portable Runtime) or NIO (Non-Blocking I/O)
  connector. A malicious web application running on a JBoss Web instance
  could use this flaw to bypass security manager restrictions and gain access
  to files it would otherwise be unable to access, or possibly terminate the
  Java Virtual Machine (JVM). (CVE-2011-2526)

  Red Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting
  CVE-2011-1484; oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858; and the Apache Tomcat
  project for reporting CVE-2011-2526. oCERT acknowledges Julian Wälde and
  Alexander Klink as the original reporters of CVE-2011-4858.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP06 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 4.3 CP07.
