summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and
  add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  It was discovered that the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) did not
  protect against being opened in a web page frame. A remote attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to conduct a clickjacking attack against SWAT users
  or users with an active SWAT session. (CVE-2013-0213)

  A flaw was found in the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
  mechanism implemented in SWAT. An attacker with the knowledge of a victim's
  password could use this flaw to bypass CSRF protections and conduct a CSRF
  attack against the victim SWAT user. (CVE-2013-0214)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Samba handled an Extended
  Attribute (EA) list provided by a client. A malicious client could send a
  specially crafted EA list that triggered an overflow, causing the server to
  loop and reprocess the list using an excessive amount of memory.
  (CVE-2013-4124)

  Note: This issue did not affect the default configuration of the
  Samba server.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2013-0213
  and CVE-2013-0214. Upstream acknowledges Jann Horn as the original reporter
  of CVE-2013-0213 and CVE-2013-0214.

  These updated samba packages include numerous bug fixes and one
  enhancement. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
  of these changes.

  All samba users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. After installing this update, the smb service will be
  restarted automatically.
