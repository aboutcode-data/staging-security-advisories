aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0328
summary: |
  Updated EPIC packages which fix an exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability
  are now available.

  EPIC (Enhanced Programmable ircII Client) is an advanced ircII chat
  client designed to connect to Internet Relay Chat (IRC) servers.

  A bug in various versions of EPIC allows remote malicious IRC servers to
  cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via a CTCP
  request from a large nickname, which causes an incorrect length
  calculation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0328 to this issue.

  Users of EPIC who may connect to untrusted servers are advised to upgrade
  to the packages in this erratum which contain a backported security fix to
  correct this issue.
