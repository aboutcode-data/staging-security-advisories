  - CVE-2005-0706
summary: |
  A new grip package is available that fixes a remote buffer overflow.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  Grip is a GTK+ based front-end for CD rippers (such as cdparanoia and
  cdda2wav) and Ogg Vorbis encoders.

  Dean Brettle discovered a buffer overflow bug in the way grip handles data
  returned by CDDB servers.  It is possible that if a user connects to a
  malicious CDDB server, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the
  victim's machine.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0706 to this issue.

  Users of grip should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.
