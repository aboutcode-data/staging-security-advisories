  - CVE-2012-5784
summary: |
  An updated devtoolset-2-axis package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Developer Toolset 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Apache Axis is an implementation of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).
  It can be used to build both web service clients and servers.

  Apache Axis did not verify that the server host name matched the domain
  name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509
  certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL
  server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name.
  (CVE-2012-5784)

  All devtoolset-2-axis users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
