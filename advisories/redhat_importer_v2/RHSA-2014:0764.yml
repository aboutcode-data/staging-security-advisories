  - CVE-2014-3496
summary: "An updated rubygem-openshift-origin-node package that fixes one security\nissue and\
  \ several bugs is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise \n2.1.1.\n\nThe Red Hat Security\
  \ Response Team has rated this update as having Critical\nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available\
  \ from the CVE link in\nthe References section.\n\nThe rubygem-openshift-origin-node package\
  \ provides basic OpenShift node\nfunctionality.\n\nA command injection flaw was found in rubygem-openshift-origin-node.\n\
  A remote, authenticated user permitted to install cartridges via the web\ninterface could\
  \ use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with root\nprivileges on the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise\
  \ node server. (CVE-2014-3496)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Jeremy Choi of the Red Hat\
  \ HSS Pen-test Team.\n\nThe rubygem-openshift-origin-node package has been upgraded to version\n\
  1.23.9.11. Additionally, the rubygem-openshift-origin-container-selinux\npackage has been\
  \ upgraded to version 0.8.1.2, as needed by the updated\nrubygem-openshift-origin-node package.\n\
  \nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The syslog_logger.rb implementation on nodes\
  \ made incorrect use of the \nRuby Syslog library. Raw log message input was handled as a\
  \ Syslog format \nstring, causing failures for many application operations. This bug fix \n\
  updates the implementation to correctly handle raw log message input, and \nthe failures no\
  \ longer occur. (BZ#1096900)\n\n* Under certain conditions, it was possible for the MCollective\
  \ agent on \nnodes to fail to fully initialize while checking the status of a cartridge. \n\
  This resulted in sporadic failures of rhc cartridge status. This bug fix \nensures that the\
  \ agent is always fully initialized. (BZ#1102399)\n\n* Developers encountered syntax errors\
  \ when connecting to a gear using the\n'rhc ssh' command if the gear was hosted on a node\
  \ with quotas disabled.\nThis was due to the command trying to report quota information but\
  \ being\ngiven an empty string because quotas were disabled. This bug fix updates\nthe handling\
  \ for reporting on quotas when there is no information to\nreport, and the syntax errors no\
  \ longer occur. (BZ#1107801)\n\n* If a file containing invalid special characters was placed\
  \ in an\napplication's ~/.env/user_vars directory, subsequent interactions with the\napplication\
  \ using SSH or Git were refused. This was due to problems with\nthe node component handling\
  \ the invalid characters. This bug fix updates\nthe node component to handle problematic files\
  \ in ~/.env/user_vars; as a\nresult, interactions with the application using SSH or Git succeed\
  \ as\nnormal. (BZ#1096833)\n\nAll rubygem-openshift-origin-node users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to this\nupdated package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue."
