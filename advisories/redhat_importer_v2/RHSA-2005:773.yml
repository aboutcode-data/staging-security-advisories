aliases:
  - CVE-2005-2700
summary: |
  An updated mod_ssl package for Apache that corrects a security issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The mod_ssl module provides strong cryptography for the Apache Web
  server via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security
  (TLS) protocols.

  A flaw was discovered in mod_ssl's handling of the "SSLVerifyClient"
  directive. This flaw occurs if a virtual host is configured
  using "SSLVerifyClient optional" and a directive "SSLVerifyClient
  required" is set for a specific location. For servers configured in this
  fashion, an attacker may be able to access resources that should otherwise
  be protected, by not supplying a client certificate when connecting. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name
  CAN-2005-2700 to this issue.

  Users of mod_ssl should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
