  - CVE-2008-1676
summary: "An updated rhpki-common package that fixes a security issue is now available\nfor\
  \ Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team. \n\nRed Hat Certificate System (RHCS) is\
  \ an enterprise software system designed\nto manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)\
  \ deployments.\n\nrhpki-common -- the Red Hat PKI Common Framework -- is required by the\n\
  following four RHCS subsystems: the Red Hat Certificate Authority; the Red\nHat Data Recovery\
  \ Manager; the Red Hat Online Certificate Status Protocol\nManager; and the Red Hat Token\
  \ Key Service.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Red Hat Certificate System handled Extensions\n\
  in the certificate signing requests (CSR). All requested Extensions were\nadded to the issued\
  \ certificate even if constraints were defined in the\nCertificate Authority (CA) profile.\
  \ An attacker could submit a CSR for a\nsubordinate CA certificate even if the CA configuration\
  \ prohibited\nsubordinate CA certificates. This lead to a bypass of the intended security\n\
  policy, possibly simplifying man-in-the-middle attacks against users that\ntrust Certificate\
  \ Authorities managed by Red Hat Certificate System.\n(CVE-2008-1676)\n\nAll users of Red\
  \ Hat Certificate System 7.3 should upgrade to this\nupdated package, which resolves this\
  \ issue."
