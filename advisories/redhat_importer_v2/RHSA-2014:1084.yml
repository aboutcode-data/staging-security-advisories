summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
  and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
  Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
  orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
  networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

  It was found that RBAC policies were not enforced in certain methods of the
  OpenStack Compute EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) API. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to escalate their privileges beyond the user group they
  were originally restricted to. Note that only certain setups using
  non-default RBAC rules for OpenStack Compute were affected. (CVE-2014-0167)

  A side-channel timing attack flaw was found in nova. An attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to guess valid instance ID signatures, giving them
  access to details of another instance, by analyzing the response times of
  requests for instance metadata. This issue only affected configurations
  that proxy metadata requests via neutron. (CVE-2014-3517)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Marc Heckmann of Ubisoft as the original
  reporter of CVE-2014-0167, and Alex Gaynor from Rackspace as the original
  reporter of CVE-2014-3517.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds one enhancement.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
  Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add this enhancement.
