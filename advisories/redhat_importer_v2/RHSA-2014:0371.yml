summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1, which fixes multiple security issues,
  various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules management system for the
  management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss rules.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1 serves as a replacement for
  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
  Refer to the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1 Release Notes for information on
  the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available
  at https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/

  The following security issues are fixed with this release:

  It was discovered that JBoss BPM Suite allowed remote authenticated users
  to submit arbitrary Java code in MVFLEX Expression Language (MVEL) or JBoss
  Rules expressions, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the
  security context of the application server. Refer to the Solution section
  for details on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2013-6468)

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
  to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
  a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
  execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

  It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
  attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
  XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
  the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
  (Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2011-5245, CVE-2012-0818)

  It was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when
  decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding
  oracle. (CVE-2013-1624)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in
  XML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker
  able to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read
  files accessible to the user running the application server and,
  potentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
  (CVE-2014-0002)

  The CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of
  the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the CVE-2013-6468 issue was
  discovered by Marc Schoenefeld of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat would like to thank Grégory Draperi for independently reporting
  CVE-2013-6468.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1.
