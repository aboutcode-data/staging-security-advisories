  - CVE-2006-0254
summary: |
  An updated Tomcat package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Application Server.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Tomcat is a servlet container for Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages
  technologies.

  Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were found in the example applications
  shipped with Tomcat. If these scripts were made publicly available, a
  remote attacker could construct a carefully crafted URL to inject arbitrary
  web content into the vulnerable application. (CVE-2006-0254)

  All users of Tomcat are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported fixes for these issues.
