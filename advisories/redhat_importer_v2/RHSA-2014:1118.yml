  - CVE-2014-5119
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9
  Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update
  Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
  programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
  standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot
  function properly.

  An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in glibc's internal
  __gconv_translit_find() function. An attacker able to make an application
  call the iconv_open() function with a specially crafted argument could
  possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
  that application. (CVE-2014-5119)

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
