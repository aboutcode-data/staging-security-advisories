summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes several security issues is
  now available.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
  environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
  bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain services
  and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide
  environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue. (CVE-2014-6271)

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-6271 was incomplete, and Bash still
  allowed certain characters to be injected into other environments via
  specially crafted environment variables. An attacker could potentially use
  this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell
  commands. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated
  attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this
  issue. (CVE-2014-7169)

  A flaw was found in the way NSS parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)
  input from certain RSA signatures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  forge RSA certificates by providing a specially crafted signature to an
  application using NSS. (CVE-2014-1568)

  It was discovered that the fixed-sized redir_stack could be forced to
  overflow in the Bash parser, resulting in memory corruption, and possibly
  leading to arbitrary code execution when evaluating untrusted input that
  would not otherwise be run as code. (CVE-2014-7186)

  An off-by-one error was discovered in the way Bash was handling deeply
  nested flow control constructs. Depending on the layout of the .bss
  segment, this could allow arbitrary execution of code that would not
  otherwise be executed by Bash. (CVE-2014-7187)

  Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting CVE-2014-6271,
  and the Mozilla project for reporting CVE-2014-1568. Upstream acknowledges
  Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Intel Product Security Incident Response Team
  as the original reporters of CVE-2014-1568. The CVE-2014-7186 and
  CVE-2014-7187 issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package.
