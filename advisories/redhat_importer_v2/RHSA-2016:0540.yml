  Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the
  management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.2.2 serves as a replacement for Red
  Hat JBoss BRMS 6.2.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are
  documented in the README.txt file included with the patch files.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A deserialization flaw allowing remote code execution was found in the
  BeanShell library. If BeanShell was on the classpath, it could permit code
  execution if another part of the application deserialized objects involving
  a specially constructed chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application
  using the BeanShell library. (CVE-2016-2510)
