  - CVE-2017-3145
summary: |
  An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A use-after-free flaw leading to denial of service was found in the way BIND internally handled cleanup operations on upstream recursion fetch contexts. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to make named, acting as a DNSSEC validating resolver, exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS request. (CVE-2017-3145)

  Red Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jayachandran Palanisamy (Cygate AB) as the original reporter.
