  - CVE-2012-0870
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 Long
  Life, and 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information.

  An input validation flaw was found in the way Samba handled Any Batched
  (AndX) requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a
  specially-crafted SMB packet to the Samba server, possibly resulting in
  arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Samba server (root).
  (CVE-2012-0870)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba team for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Andy Davis of NGS Secure as the original reporter.

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
