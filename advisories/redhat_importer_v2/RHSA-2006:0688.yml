summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor the\
  \ Red Hat Application Stack.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP\
  \ memory handling routines. If\na script can cause memory allocation based on untrusted user\
  \ data, a remote\nattacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute arbitrary code\n\
  as the 'apache' user.  (CVE-2006-4812)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the PHP sscanf()\
  \ function.  If a script\nused the sscanf() function with positional arguments in the format\
  \ string,\na remote attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute\narbitrary\
  \ code as the 'apache' user.  (CVE-2006-4020)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the\
  \ PHP wordwrap() and str_repeat()\nfunctions.  If a script running on a 64-bit server used\
  \ either of these\nfunctions on untrusted user data, a remote attacker sending a carefully\n\
  crafted request might be able to cause a heap overflow.  (CVE-2006-4482)\n\nA buffer overflow\
  \ was discovered in the PHP gd extension. If a script was\nset up to process GIF images from\
  \ untrusted sources using the gd extension,\na remote attacker could cause a heap overflow.\
  \ (CVE-2006-4484)\n\nA buffer overread was discovered in the PHP stripos() function.  If a\n\
  script used the stripos() function with untrusted user data, PHP may read\npast the end of\
  \ a buffer, which could allow a denial of service attack by a\nremote user. (CVE-2006-4485)\n\
  \nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory allocation handling. \nOn 64-bit platforms,\
  \ the \"memory_limit\" setting was not enforced correctly,\nwhich could allow a denial of\
  \ service attack by a remote user. (CVE-2006-4486)\n\nThese packages also contain a fix for\
  \ a bug where certain input strings to\nthe metaphone() function could cause memory corruption.\n\
  \nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches\
  \ to correct these issues."
