summary: |
  Updated rpm packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4
  Extended Life Cycle Support; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 Long Life; and
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6, 6.0 and 6.1 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a command-line driven package management
  system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and
  updating software packages.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way RPM parsed package file headers. An
  attacker could create a specially-crafted RPM package that, when its
  package header was accessed, or during package signature verification,
  could cause an application using the RPM library (such as the rpm command
  line tool, or the yum and up2date package managers) to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-0060, CVE-2012-0061,
  CVE-2012-0815)

  Note: Although an RPM package can, by design, execute arbitrary code when
  installed, this issue would allow a specially-crafted RPM package to
  execute arbitrary code before its digital signature has been verified.
  Package downloads from the Red Hat Network are protected by the use of a
  secure HTTPS connection in addition to the RPM package signature checks.

  All RPM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues. All running applications linked
  against the RPM library must be restarted for this update to take effect.
