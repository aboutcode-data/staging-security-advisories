  - CVE-2015-7545
summary: |
  Updated git19-git packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Software Collections 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Git is a distributed revision control system with a decentralized
  architecture. As opposed to centralized version control systems with a
  client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git repository
  is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows the
  user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have
  permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also
  makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection.

  A flaw was found in the way the git-remote-ext helper processed certain
  URLs. If a user had Git configured to automatically clone submodules from
  untrusted repositories, an attacker could inject commands into the URL of a
  submodule, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
  (BZ#1269794)

  All git19-git users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
