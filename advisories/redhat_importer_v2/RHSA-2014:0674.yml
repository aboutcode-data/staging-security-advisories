summary: |
  Updated rhev-hypervisor6 packages that fix multiple security issues,
  several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.

  Multiple integer overflow, input validation, logic error, and buffer
  overflow flaws were discovered in various QEMU block drivers. An attacker
  able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to
  crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially
  resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of
  the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-0143, CVE-2014-0144, CVE-2014-0145,
  CVE-2014-0147)

  Multiple buffer overflow, input validation, and out-of-bounds write flaws
  were found in the way the virtio, virtio-net, virtio-scsi, and usb drivers
  of QEMU handled state loading after migration. A user able to alter the
  savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could
  use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the
  (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
  execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
  (CVE-2013-4148, CVE-2013-4151, CVE-2013-4535, CVE-2013-4536, CVE-2013-4541,
  CVE-2013-4542, CVE-2013-6399, CVE-2014-0182, CVE-2014-3461)

  An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the way QEMU's IDE device
  driver handled the execution of SMART EXECUTE OFFLINE commands.
  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process memory
  on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on
  the host with the privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-2894)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the virtio_net_handle_mac()
  function of QEMU processed guest requests to update the table of MAC
  addresses. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU
  process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code
  execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
  (CVE-2014-0150)

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the seek_to_sector() function of the
  parallels block driver in QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image
  file loaded by a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.
  (CVE-2014-0142)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QCOW2 block driver in
  QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could
  use this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-0146)

  It was found that the block driver for Hyper-V VHDX images did not
  correctly calculate BAT (Block Allocation Table) entries due to a missing
  bounds check. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a
  guest could use this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-0148)

  The CVE-2014-0143 issues were discovered by Kevin Wolf and Stefan Hajnoczi
  of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0144 issues were discovered by Fam Zheng, Jeff
  Cody, Kevin Wolf, and Stefan Hajnoczi of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0145 issues
  were discovered by Stefan Hajnoczi of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0150 issue was
  discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0142,
  CVE-2014-0146, and CVE-2014-0147 issues were discovered by Kevin Wolf of
  Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0148 issue was discovered by Jeff Cody of Red Hat,
  and the CVE-2013-4148, CVE-2013-4151, CVE-2013-4535, CVE-2013-4536,
  CVE-2013-4541, CVE-2013-4542, CVE-2013-6399, CVE-2014-0182, and
  CVE-2014-3461 issues were discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat,
  Anthony Liguori, and Michael Roth.

  Other changes to the rhev-hypervisor6 component:

  * The most recent builds of rhn-virtualization-common and
  rhn-virtualization-host are included in version 3.4.0. (BZ#1095812)

  All users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements. After installing this update, shut down all running
  virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them
  again for this update to take effect.
