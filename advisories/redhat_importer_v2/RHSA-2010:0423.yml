  - CVE-2010-1321
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the MIT Kerberos Generic
  Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) library. A remote,
  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash any server application
  using the GSS-API authentication mechanism, by sending a specially-crafted
  GSS-API token with a missing checksum field. (CVE-2010-1321)

  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos Team for responsibly reporting
  this issue. Upstream acknowledges Shawn Emery of Oracle as the original
  reporter.

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. All running services using the MIT
  Kerberos libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.
