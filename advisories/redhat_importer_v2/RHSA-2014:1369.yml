summary: |
  Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P6 (Patch 6 on Rollup Patch 1),
  which addresses three security issues, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Fuse ESB Enterprise is an integration platform based on Apache ServiceMix.
  Fuse MQ Enterprise, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards-compliant
  messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

  This release of Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P6 is an update
  to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 and Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0. The following
  security issues are addressed with this release:

  It was discovered that Apache Shiro authenticated users without specifying
  a user name or a password when used in conjunction with an LDAP back end
  that allowed unauthenticated binds. (CVE-2014-0074)

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
  validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
  arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
  SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
  XML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

  All users of Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ
  Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P6.
