summary: |
  An update for samba is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the related Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allow PC-compatible machines to share files, printers, and various information.

  Security Fix(es):

  * samba: smbd allows client access to unix domain sockets on the file system as root (CVE-2023-3961)

  * samba: SMB clients can truncate files with read-only permissions (CVE-2023-4091)

  * samba: "rpcecho" development server allows denial of service via sleep() call on AD DC (CVE-2023-42669)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
