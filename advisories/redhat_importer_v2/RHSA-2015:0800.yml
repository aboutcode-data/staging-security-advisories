summary: "Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate\
  \ security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed\
  \ severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References\
  \ section.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\n\
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose\
  \ cryptography library.\n\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys\
  \ when using\nnon-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL\nclient\
  \ using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method. (CVE-2015-0204)\n\nAn integer underflow\
  \ flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the\nway OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded\
  \ inputs. An attacker able to\nmake an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted\
  \ Base64-encoded\ninput (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application\
  \ to\ncrash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because\nthe data\
  \ being transferred is not Base64-encoded. (CVE-2015-0292)\n\nA denial of service flaw was\
  \ found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2\nhandshake messages. A remote attacker could use\
  \ this flaw to cause a\nTLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had\
  \ both\nthe SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)\n\nMultiple\
  \ flaws were found in the way OpenSSL parsed X.509 certificates.\nAn attacker could use these\
  \ flaws to modify an X.509 certificate to produce\na certificate with a different fingerprint\
  \ without invalidating its\nsignature, and possibly bypass fingerprint-based blacklisting\
  \ in\napplications. (CVE-2014-8275)\n\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way OpenSSL\
  \ reused certain\nASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use a specially crafted\n\
  ASN.1 structure that, when parsed by an application, would cause that\napplication to crash.\
  \ (CVE-2015-0287)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenSSL's X.509 certificate\n\
  handling implementation. A specially crafted X.509 certificate could cause\nan application\
  \ using OpenSSL to crash if the application attempted to\nconvert the certificate to a certificate\
  \ request. (CVE-2015-0288)\n\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled\
  \ certain\nPKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL\nverify, decrypt,\
  \ or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that\napplication to crash. TLS/SSL\
  \ clients and servers using OpenSSL were not\naffected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0289)\n\nRed\
  \ Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting \nCVE-2015-0287, CVE-2015-0288,\
  \ CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0292, and \nCVE-2015-0293. Upstream acknowledges Emilia Käsper of\
  \ the OpenSSL \ndevelopment team as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0287, Brian Carpenter\
  \ \nas the original reporter of CVE-2015-0288, Michal Zalewski of Google as the \noriginal\
  \ reporter of CVE-2015-0289, Robert Dugal and David Ramos as the \noriginal reporters of CVE-2015-0292,\
  \ and Sean Burford of Google and Emilia \nKäsper of the OpenSSL development team as the original\
  \ reporters of \nCVE-2015-0293.\n\nAll openssl users are advised to upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take\n\
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or\nthe system rebooted."
