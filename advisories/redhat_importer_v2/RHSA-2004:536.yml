  - CVE-2001-1413
summary: "An updated ncompress package that fixes a buffer overflow and problem in\nthe handling\
  \ of files larger than 2 GB is now available.\n\nThe ncompress package contains the compress\
  \ and uncompress file compression\nand decompression utilities, which are compatible with\
  \ the original UNIX\ncompress utility (.Z file extensions).\n\nA bug in the way ncompress\
  \ handles long filenames has been discovered. \nncompress versions 4.2.4 and earlier contain\
  \ a stack based buffer overflow\nwhen handling very long filenames.  It is possible that an\
  \ attacker could\nexecute arbitrary code on a victims machine by tricking the user into\n\
  decompressing a carefully crafted filename.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2001-1413 to\nthis issue.\n\nThis updated ncompress\
  \ package also fixes a problem in the handling of\nfiles larger than 2 GB.\n\nAll users of\
  \ ncompress should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains fixes for these issues."
