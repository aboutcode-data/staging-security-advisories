summary: |
  Updated Django packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Django web framework is used by horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
  is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

  A flaw was found in the way Django's reverse() URL resolver function
  constructed certain URLs. A remote attacker able to request a specially
  crafted view from a Django application could use this flaw to import and
  execute arbitrary Python modules on the system under the privileges of the
  user running the application. (CVE-2014-0472)

  It was found that Django's caching framework reused Cross-Site Request
  Forgery (CSRF) nonces for all requests from unauthenticated clients.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a
  different user and bypass intended CSRF protections in a Django
  application. (CVE-2014-0473)

  It was discovered that certain Django model field classes did not properly
  perform type conversion on their arguments. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to submit a specially crafted SQL query that, when processed by a
  Django application using a MySQL database, could have various
  application-specific impacts on the MySQL database. (CVE-2014-0474)

  Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Benjamin Bach as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-0472, Paul McMillan as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0473, and
  the Ruby on Rails team, and specifically Michael Koziarski, as the original
  reporters of CVE-2014-0474.

  All users of OpenStack Dashboard are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which resolve these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for
  the update to take effect.
