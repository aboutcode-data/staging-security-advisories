summary: |
  An update for JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2 that fixes one security issue
  is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution
  that provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor
  JBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  A flaw was found in the way LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
  authentication was handled. If the LDAP bind account credentials became
  invalid, subsequent log in attempts with any password for user accounts
  created via LDAP were successful. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to log into LDAP-based JBoss ON accounts without knowing the correct
  passwords. (CVE-2012-1100)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON
  installation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,
  the JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
