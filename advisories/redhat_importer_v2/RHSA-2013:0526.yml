  - CVE-2012-3386
summary: |
  An updated automake package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files compliant
  with the GNU Coding Standards.

  It was found that the distcheck rule in Automake-generated Makefiles made a
  directory world-writable when preparing source archives. If a malicious,
  local user could access this directory, they could execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running "make distcheck". (CVE-2012-3386)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jim Meyering for reporting this issue. Upstream
  acknowledges Stefano Lattarini as the original reporter.

  Users of automake are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects this issue.
