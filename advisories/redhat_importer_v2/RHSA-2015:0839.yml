  - CVE-2014-8124
summary: |
  Updated python-django-horizon and python-django-openstack-auth packages
  that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
  interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
  The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
  size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
  to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the OpenStack Dashboard (horizon)
  when using the db or memcached session engine. An attacker could make
  repeated requests to the login page, which would result in a large number
  of unwanted backend session entries, possibly leading to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2014-8124)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable as the original
  reporter.

  The python-django-horizon packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version,
  including:

  * Default 'target={}' value leaks into subsequent 'policy.check()' calls.
  * Neutron subnet create tooltip has invalid HTML tags.
  * Memory reported improperly in admin dashboard.
  * The container dashboard does not handle unicode URL correctly.
  (BZ#1203281)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The option 'OPENSTACK_SSL_NO_VERIFY' is used to enable or disable checks
  for SSL certificate validity. Prior to this update, swift clients ignored
  this check. As a result, you could not use horizon with swift, and swift
  was accessed via a self signed certificate. With this update, the option is
  now handled properly and Horizon is able to use this endpoint while the
  'OPENSTACK_SSL_NO_VERIFY' option is enabled. (BZ#1192517)

  * Previously, horizon.log was not truncated automatically, resulting in
  very large log files. With this update, files are now trimmed by logrotate,
  fixing this issue. (BZ#1112621)

  All OpenStack Dashboard users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
