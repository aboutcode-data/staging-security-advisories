summary: |
  Updated mingw32-libxml2 packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This advisory also contains
  information about future updates for the mingw32 packages, as well as the
  deprecation of the packages with the release of Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  These packages provide the libxml2 library, a development toolbox providing
  the implementation of various XML standards, for users of MinGW (Minimalist
  GNU for Windows).

  IMPORTANT NOTE: The mingw32 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will no
  longer be updated proactively and will be deprecated with the release of
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4. These packages were provided to support other
  capabilities in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and were not intended for direct
  customer use. Customers are advised to not use these packages with
  immediate effect. Future updates to these packages will be at Red Hat's
  discretion and these packages may be removed in a future minor release.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
  entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
  against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2011-3919)

  A heap-based buffer underflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
  certain entities. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
  file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
  cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-5134)

  It was found that the hashing routine used by libxml2 arrays was
  susceptible to predictable hash collisions. Sending a specially-crafted
  message to an XML service could result in longer processing time, which
  could lead to a denial of service. To mitigate this issue, randomization
  has been added to the hashing function to reduce the chance of an attacker
  successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2012-0841)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath (XML Path
  Language) expressions. If an attacker were able to supply a
  specially-crafted XML file to an application using libxml2, as well as an
  XPath expression for that application to run against the crafted file, it
  could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494,
  CVE-2011-2821, CVE-2011-2834)

  Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libxml2 decoded
  certain XML files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
  file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
  cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0216,
  CVE-2011-3102)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker
  were able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using
  libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against
  the crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1944)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker
  could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an
  application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2011-3905)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting the
  CVE-2010-4008 issue. Upstream acknowledges Bui Quang Minh from Bkis as the
  original reporter of CVE-2010-4008.

  All users of mingw32-libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
