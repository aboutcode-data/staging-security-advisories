  - CVE-2013-0787
summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A flaw was found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious content
  could cause Thunderbird to crash or execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0787)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges VUPEN Security via the TippingPoint Zero Day
  Initiative project as the original reporter.

  Note: This issue cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted HTML mail
  message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages. It could
  be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full
  remote content of an RSS feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects this issue. After installing the update, Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
