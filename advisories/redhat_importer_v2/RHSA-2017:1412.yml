summary: |
  An update for eap7-jboss-ec2-eap is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for RHEL 6 and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0 for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The eap7-jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

  With this update, the eap7-jboss-ec2-eap package has been updated to ensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.6.

  Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.6 Release Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that under certain conditions RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with YamlProvider, resulting in unmarshalling of potentially untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this flaw execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy. (CVE-2016-9606)

  * It was found that the log file viewer in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application 6 and 7 allows arbitrary file read to authenticated user via path traversal. (CVE-2017-2595)

  * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own. (CVE-2017-2666)

  * It was found that with non-clean TCP close, Websocket server gets into infinite loop on every IO thread, effectively causing DoS. (CVE-2017-2670)

  Red Hat would like to thank Moritz Bechler (AgNO3 GmbH & Co. KG) for reporting CVE-2016-9606 and Gregory Ramsperger and Ryan Moak for reporting CVE-2017-2670. The CVE-2017-2666 issue was discovered by Radim Hatlapatka (Red Hat).
