  - CVE-2014-0240
summary: |
  Updated python27-mod_wsgi and python33-mod_wsgi packages that fix one
  security issue are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The mod_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI-compliant
  interface for hosting Python-based web applications within Apache.

  It was found that mod_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if the call to
  setuid() failed. If mod_wsgi was set up to allow unprivileged users to run
  WSGI applications, a local user able to run a WSGI application could
  possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2014-0240)

  Note: mod_wsgi is not intended to provide privilege separation for WSGI
  applications. Systems relying on mod_wsgi to limit or sandbox the
  privileges of mod_wsgi applications should migrate to a different solution
  with proper privilege separation.

  Red Hat would like to thank Graham Dumpleton for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Róbert Kisteleki as the original reporter of this
  issue.

  All python27-mod_wsgi and python33-mod_wsgi users are advised to upgrade to
  these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this
  issue.
