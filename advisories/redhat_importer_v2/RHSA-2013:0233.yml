  - CVE-2012-5629
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one security
  issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light
  and rich Java applications.

  When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
  (LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
  default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
  by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
  recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
  update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
  false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and
  configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
