  - CVE-2015-3239
summary: |
  Updated libunwind packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Libunwind provides a C ABI to determine the call-chain of a program.

  An off-by-one array indexing error was found in the libunwind API, which
  could cause an error when reading untrusted binaries or dwarf debug info
  data. Red Hat products do not call the API in this way; and it is unlikely
  that any exploitable attack vector exists in current builds or supported
  usage. (CVE-2015-3239)

  This issue was discovered by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.

  All users of libunwind are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
