summary: |
  Updated openoffice.org 2.x packages to correct multiple security issues are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  OpenOffice.org is an office productivity suite that includes desktop
  applications such as a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation manager,
  formula editor, and drawing program.

  Multiple heap overflows and an integer underflow were found in the Quattro
  Pro(R) import filter. An attacker could create a carefully crafted Quattro
  Pro file that could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute
  arbitrary code if the file was opened by a victim. (CVE-2007-5745,
  CVE-2007-5747)

  A heap overflow flaw was found in the EMF parser. An attacker could create
  a carefully crafted EMF file that could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or
  possibly execute arbitrary code if the malicious EMF image was added to a
  document or if a document containing the malicious EMF file was opened by a
  victim. (CVE-2007-5746)

  A heap overflow flaw was found in the OLE Structured Storage file parser.
  (OLE Structured Storage is a format used by Microsoft Office documents.) An
  attacker could create a carefully crafted OLE file that could cause
  OpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code if the file was
  opened by a victim. (CVE-2008-0320)

  All users of OpenOffice.org are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported fixes to correct these issues.
