  - CVE-2007-3304
summary: "Updated Apache httpd packages that correct two security issues are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web\
  \ server.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server did not verify that a process was an Apache child\nprocess\
  \ before sending it signals. A local attacker who has the ability to\nrun scripts on the Apache\
  \ HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and\ncause arbitrary processes to be terminated,\
  \ which could lead to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2007-3304) \n\nA flaw was found in the Apache\
  \ HTTP Server mod_status module. Sites with\nthe server-status page publicly accessible and\
  \ ExtendedStatus enabled were\nvulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. On Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux\nthe server-status page is not enabled by default and it is best practice to\nnot\
  \ make this publicly available. (CVE-2006-5752)\n\nUsers of Apache should upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Users should\
  \ restart Apache\nafter installing this update."
