summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Exif extension. A specially crafted
  JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the exif_thumbnail()
  function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of the user running that PHP application. (CVE-2014-3670)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way custom objects were
  unserialized. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
  function could cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3669)

  An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way the File Information
  (fileinfo) extension parsed Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a PHP application using
  fileinfo via a specially crafted ELF file. (CVE-2014-3710)

  An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way the xmlrpc extension parsed
  dates in the ISO 8601 format. A specially crafted XML-RPC request or
  response could possibly cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3668)

  The CVE-2014-3710 issue was discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat
  Product Security.

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
