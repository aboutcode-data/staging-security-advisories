summary: "Updated seamonkey packages that fix two security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having\
  \ critical\nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich\
  \ give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links\
  \ in the References section.\n\nSeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup\
  \ client, IRC\nchat client, and HTML editor.\n\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled\
  \ frame objects with certain\nnames. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a plug-in to\
  \ grant its\ncontent access to another site or the local file system, violating the\nsame-origin\
  \ policy. (CVE-2011-2999)\n\nAn integer underflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled\
  \ large\nJavaScript regular expressions. A web page containing malicious JavaScript\ncould\
  \ cause SeaMonkey to access already freed memory, causing SeaMonkey to\ncrash or, potentially,\
  \ execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2998)\n\
  \ \nAll SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct\nthese issues.\
  \ After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for\nthe changes to take effect."
