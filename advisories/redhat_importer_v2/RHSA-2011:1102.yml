  - CVE-2011-2524
summary: |
  Updated libsoup packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  libsoup is an HTTP client/library implementation for GNOME.

  A directory traversal flaw was found in libsoup's SoupServer. If an
  application used SoupServer to implement an HTTP service, a remote attacker
  who is able to connect to that service could use this flaw to access any
  local files accessible to that application via a specially-crafted request.
  (CVE-2011-2524)

  All users of libsoup should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. All running applications
  using libsoup's SoupServer must be restarted for the update to take effect.
