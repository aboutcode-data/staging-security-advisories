  - CVE-2004-0113
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages are now available that fix a denial of service
  vulnerability in mod_ssl and include various other bug fixes.

  The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
  freely-available Web server.

  A memory leak in mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.0.49
  allows a remote denial of service attack against an SSL-enabled server. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0113 to this issue.

  This update also includes various bug fixes, including:

  - Improvements to the mod_expires, mod_dav, mod_ssl, and mod_proxy modules

  - A fix for a bug causing core dumps during configuration parsing on the
  IA64 platform

  - An updated version of mod_include fixing several edge cases in the SSI parser

  Additionally, the mod_logio module is now included.

  Users of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches that address these issues.
