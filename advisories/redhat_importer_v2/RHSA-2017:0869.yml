  - CVE-2016-8399
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)

  Enhancement(s):

  * Previously, the mpt3sas driver incorrectly checked the Transport Layer Retries (TLR) state even on Redundant Array Of Independent Discs (RAID) devices. Consequently, a kernel panic occurred when mpt3sas attempted to read from the RAID devices. With this update, mpt3sas has been fixed to check the TLR state only for non-RAID devices, and the kernel no longer panics under the described circumstances. (BZ#1427459)
