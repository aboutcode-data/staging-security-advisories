  - CVE-2014-0227
summary: |
  Updated tomcat packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  It was discovered that the ChunkedInputFilter in Tomcat did not fail
  subsequent attempts to read input after malformed chunked encoding was
  detected. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make Tomcat
  process part of the request body as new request, or cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2014-0227)

  All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the tomcat service will be restarted automatically.
