summary: |
  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest Image for cloud instances had
  an empty root password by default.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat provides a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest Image for
  cloud instances. This image is provided as a minimally configured system
  image which is available for use as-is or for configuration and
  customization as required by end users.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest Image for cloud instances had an
  empty root password by default. To address this, Red Hat has created an
  updated image that locks the root password by default. This updated image
  is now available on RHN.

  To correct existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest Images, any
  images or systems built using this Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 KVM Guest
  Image, or any currently running Red Hat Enterprise Linux instances
  instantiated from this image, users can lock the root password by issuing,
  as root, the command:

  passwd -l root

  Note: The default OpenSSH configuration disallows password logins when
  the password is empty, preventing a remote attacker from logging in
  without a password.

  Root Cause

  Kickstart can be used to automate operating system installations. A
  Kickstart file specifies settings for an installation. Once the
  installation system boots, it can read a Kickstart file and carry out the
  installation process without any further input from a user. Kickstart is
  used as part of the process of creating Images of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  for cloud providers.

  It was discovered that when no 'rootpw' command was specified in a
  Kickstart file, the image creator tools gave the root user an empty
  password rather than leaving the password locked, which could allow a local
  user to gain access to the root account (CVE-2013-2069).

  We have corrected this issue by updating the Kickstart file used to build
  affected images to lock the password file.

  This issue was caused by the way a tool was used to create Images, and not
  due to a security vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  To import the image into an OpenStack environment, download the image from
  Red Hat Network to a system that has the python-glanceclient package
  installed. Refer to the OpenStack Getting Started Guide, linked to in the
  References, for information on importing the image into an OpenStack
  environment. After successfully importing, it is also highly recommended
  that the "glance delete" command is used to delete any previous versions of
  the image that exist in the Glance image registry.
