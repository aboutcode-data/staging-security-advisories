  - CVE-2014-3530
summary: |
  Updated packages for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0
  that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java
  applications, which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss
  Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

  It was found that the implementation of the
  org.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method
  provided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.
  A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting this issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
