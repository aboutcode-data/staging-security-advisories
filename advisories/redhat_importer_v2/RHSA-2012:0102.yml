  - CVE-2012-0059
summary: |
  Updated spacewalk-backend packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Network Proxy 5.4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Network (RHN) Proxy provides a mechanism for caching content, such
  as package updates from Red Hat or custom content created for an
  organization on an internal, centrally-located server.

  If a user submitted a system registration XML-RPC call to an RHN Proxy
  server (for example, by running "rhnreg_ks") and that call failed, their
  RHN user password was included in plain text in the error messages both
  stored in the server log and mailed to the server administrator. With this
  update, user passwords are excluded from these error messages to avoid the
  exposure of authentication credentials. (CVE-2012-0059)

  Users of Red Hat Network Proxy are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. For this update to take effect,
  Red Hat Network Proxy must be restarted. Refer to the Solution section for
  details.
