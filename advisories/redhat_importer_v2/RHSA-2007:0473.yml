  - CVE-2006-3619
summary: |
  Updated gcc packages that fix a security issue and another bug are now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The gcc packages include C, C++, Java, Fortran 77, Objective C, and Ada 95
  GNU compilers and related support libraries.

  Jürgen Weigert discovered a directory traversal flaw in fastjar. An
  attacker could create a malicious JAR file which, if unpacked using
  fastjar, could write to any files the victim had write access to.
  (CVE-2006-3619)

  These updated packages also fix a reload internal compiler error with
  -fnon-call-exceptions option.

  All users of gcc should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  these issues.
