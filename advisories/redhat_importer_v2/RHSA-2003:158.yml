summary: "Updated mm packages are now available for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and\npSeries\
  \ systems.  These updates address possible vulnerabilities in the way\nthe MM library opens\
  \ temporary files.\n\nThe MM library provides an abstraction layer allowing related processes\n\
  to share data easily.  On systems where shared memory or other\ninter-process communication\
  \ mechanisms are not available, the MM library\nemulates them using temporary files.  MM is\
  \ used in Red Hat Linux to \nproviding shared memory pools to Apache modules.\n\nVersions\
  \ of MM up to and including 1.1.3 open temporary files in an unsafe\nmanner, allowing a malicious\
  \ local user to cause an application that uses\nMM to overwrite any file to which it has write\
  \ access.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain a\n\
  patched version of MM that is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nThanks to Marcus Meissner for\
  \ providing a patch for this issue."
