summary: |
  Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 Patch 3, which fixes three security issues and
  various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Fuse ESB Enterprise, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides an integration
  platform.

  This release of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 Patch 3 is an update to Fuse ESB
  Enterprise 7.1.0 and includes bug fixes. Refer to the readme file included
  with the patch files for information about the bug fixes.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  If web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor
  enabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these
  services were always granted access, without applying authentication
  checks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing
  REST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple
  SOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints
  applied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if
  WSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that
  use WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)

  It was found that the Apache CXF UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and
  UsernameTokenInterceptor allowed a UsernameToken element with no password
  child element to bypass authentication. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to circumvent access controls applied to web services by omitting the
  password in a UsernameToken. This flaw was exploitable on web services that
  rely on WS-SecurityPolicy plain text UsernameTokens to authenticate users.
  It was not exploitable when using hashed passwords or WS-Security without
  WS-SecurityPolicy. (CVE-2013-0239)

  A flaw was found in the way the Spring Security Framework
  DaoAuthenticationProvider performed user authentication. A remote attacker
  could possibly use this flaw to determine if a username was valid or not by
  observing the time differences during attempted authentication. A caller to
  an Apache Camel route could possibly use this flaw to perform a
  side-channel timing attacking to find valid usernames (but not their
  passwords). (CVE-2012-5055)

  All users of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 Patch
  3.
