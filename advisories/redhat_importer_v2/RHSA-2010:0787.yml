  - CVE-2010-3847
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
  programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
  standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot
  function properly.

  It was discovered that the glibc dynamic linker/loader did not handle the
  $ORIGIN dynamic string token set in the LD_AUDIT environment variable
  securely. A local attacker with write access to a file system containing
  setuid or setgid binaries could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2010-3847)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting this issue.

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
