  - CVE-2008-2374
summary: |
  Updated bluez-libs and bluez-utils packages that fix a security flaw are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The bluez-libs package contains libraries for use in Bluetooth
  applications. The bluez-utils package contains Bluetooth daemons and utilities.

  An input validation flaw was found in the Bluetooth Session Description
  Protocol (SDP) packet parser used by the Bluez Bluetooth utilities. A
  Bluetooth device with an already-established trust relationship, or a local
  user registering a service record via a UNIX® socket or D-Bus interface,
  could cause a crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with privileges of
  the hcid daemon. (CVE-2008-2374)

  Users of bluez-libs and bluez-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
