summary: "This is an updated version of the Self Node Remediation Operator. This Operator is\
  \ delivered by Red Hat Workload Availability.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update\
  \ as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\
  \ score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from\

  \ and ReadWriteOnce (RWO) Volumes, as well as restoring compute capacity in the event of transient\
  \ failures. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* golang: net/http, x/net/http2: rapid stream resets\
  \ can cause excessive work (CVE-2023-44487) (CVE-2023-39325)\n\n* HTTP/2: Multiple HTTP/2\
  \ enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack) (CVE-2023-44487)\n\
