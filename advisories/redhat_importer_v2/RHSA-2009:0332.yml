summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes several security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Firefox-compatible Adobe Flash Player
  Web browser plug-in.

  Multiple input validation flaws were found in the way Flash Player
  displayed certain SWF (Shockwave Flash) content. An attacker could use
  these flaws to create a specially-crafted SWF file that could cause
  flash-plugin to crash, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when the victim
  loaded a page containing the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2009-0520,
  CVE-2009-0519)

  It was discovered that Adobe Flash Player had an insecure RPATH (runtime
  library search path) set in the ELF (Executable and Linking Format) header.
  A local user with write access to the directory pointed to by RPATH could
  use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Adobe Flash Player. (CVE-2009-0521)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
  upgrades Flash Player to version 10.0.22.87.
