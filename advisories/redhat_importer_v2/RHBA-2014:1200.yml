summary: "The updated sos package that fixes several bugs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 5.\n\nThe sos package contains a set of utilities that gather information from system\n\
  hardware, logs, and configuration files. The information can then be used for\ndiagnostic\
  \ purposes and debugging.\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the sosreport\
  \ utility did not include the output of the \"brctl\nshow\" command for all systems. Consequently,\
  \ information on bridged network\nconfigurations was only available in the report tarball\
  \ on systems using Xen for\nvirtualization. With this update, the networking module collects\
  \ the output of\n\"brctl show\" as well as \"brctl showstp\" commands for each configured\
  \ bridge, and\nthus bridged network configuration information is now available in the report\n\
  tarball for all hosts. (BZ#833406) \n\n* Previous versions of the sosreport utility used the\
  \ legacy ifconfig command to\ndetect network interfaces, but ifconfig did not support interfaces\
  \ named via\nbiosdevname. As a consequence, no information on biosdevname interfaces was\n\
  present in the report tarball. With this update, the sosreport networking\nplug-in now uses\
  \ the \"ip\" command to detect interfaces of all types, and full\ninformation on biosdevname\
  \ interfaces is now included. (BZ#980177) \n\n* Previously, the sosreport utility collected\
  \ the krb5.keytab file from Kerberos\ninstallations. Although encrypted, this file can contain\
  \ sensitive key material.\nWith this update, sosreport collects a summary of krb5.keytab using\
  \ the klist\ncommand but does not collect the krb5.keytab file itself. As a result,\nkrb5.keytab\
  \ data is still available but no sensitive information is included in\nthe report tarball.\
  \ (BZ#1029017)\n\n* Previously, the sosreport \"ds\" plug-in collected all directory server\
  \ logs by\ndefault. Depending on the log configuration, this could lead to very large\nreport\
  \ sizes. With this update, sosreport collects by default only the current\nversion of the\
  \ directory server logs regarding to \"access\", \"errors\" and\n\"audit\", and rotated logs\
  \ are not collected by default. In addition, the plug-in\nnow supports an \"all_logs\" option\
  \ that can be used to request the old behavior.\nAs a result, the default report size for\
  \ directory server hosts is now smaller\nand more consistent unless full log data is explicitly\
  \ requested. (BZ#1086736)\n\n* Prior to this update, the sosreport utility could include password\
  \ material in\nthe grub.conf and fstab files collected by the boot loader and file system\n\
  plug-ins if present on the collection system. Consequently, passwords, either\nplain text\
  \ or hashed, could be included in the report tarball. With this bug fix\nupdate, password\
  \ and other secrets are now removed during collection, and\npasswords from the fstab or grub.conf\
  \ files can no longer appear in the report\ntarball. (BZ#1107751) \n\nUsers of sos are advised\
  \ to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these\nbugs."
