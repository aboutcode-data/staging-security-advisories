summary: |
  Updated abrt packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  ABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) is a tool to help users to detect
  defects in applications and to create a bug report with all the information
  needed by a maintainer to fix it. It uses a plug-in system to extend its
  functionality.

  It was found that ABRT was vulnerable to multiple race condition and
  symbolic link flaws. A local attacker could use these flaws to potentially
  escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3315)

  It was discovered that the kernel-invoked coredump processor provided by
  ABRT wrote core dumps to files owned by other system users. This could
  result in information disclosure if an application crashed while its
  current directory was a directory writable to by other users (such as
  /tmp). (CVE-2015-3142)

  It was discovered that the default event handling scripts installed by ABRT
  did not handle symbolic links correctly. A local attacker with write access
  to an ABRT problem directory could use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2015-1869)

  It was found that the ABRT event scripts created a user-readable copy of an
  sosreport file in ABRT problem directories, and included excerpts of
  /var/log/messages selected by the user-controlled process name, leading to
  an information disclosure. (CVE-2015-1870)

  It was discovered that, when moving problem reports between certain
  directories, abrt-handle-upload did not verify that the new problem
  directory had appropriate permissions and did not contain symbolic links.
  An attacker able to create a crafted problem report could use this flaw to
  expose other parts of ABRT, or to overwrite arbitrary files on the system.
  (CVE-2015-3147)

  It was discovered that the abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache
  helper program did not properly filter the process environment before
  invoking abrt-action-install-debuginfo. A local attacker could use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3159)

  The CVE-2015-1869, CVE-2015-1870, CVE-2015-3142, CVE-2015-3147, and
  CVE-2015-3159 issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
  Product Security.

  All users of abrt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues.
