  - CVE-2012-0818
summary: |
  Updated resteasy packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and
  6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  RESTEasy provides various frameworks to help you build RESTful web services
  and RESTful Java applications.

  It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
  attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
  XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
  the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
  (Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2012-0818)

  Note: The fix for CVE-2012-0818 is not enabled by default. This update adds
  a new configuration option to disable entity expansion in RESTEasy. If
  applications on your server expose RESTEasy XML endpoints, a
  resteasy.document.expand.entity.references configuration snippet must be
  added to their web.xml file to disable entity expansion in RESTEasy. Refer
  to Red Hat Bugzilla bug 785631 for details.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise Web
  Platform's "jboss-as-web/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory and any other
  customized configuration files.

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4,
  5, and 6 should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this
  issue. The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
