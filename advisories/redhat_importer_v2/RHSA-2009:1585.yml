summary: |
  Updated samba3x packages that fix multiple security issues and various bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information. These samba3x packages provide Samba 3.3, which is a
  Technology Preview for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. These packages cannot be
  installed in parallel with the samba packages. Note: Technology Previews
  are not intended for production use.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Samba smbd daemon. An
  authenticated, remote user could send a specially-crafted response that
  would cause an smbd child process to enter an infinite loop. An
  authenticated, remote user could use this flaw to exhaust system resources
  by opening multiple CIFS sessions. (CVE-2009-2906)

  An uninitialized data access flaw was discovered in the smbd daemon when
  using the non-default "dos filemode" configuration option in "smb.conf". An
  authenticated, remote user with write access to a file could possibly use
  this flaw to change an access control list for that file, even when such
  access should have been denied. (CVE-2009-1888)

  A flaw was discovered in the way Samba handled users without a home
  directory set in the back-end password database (e.g. "/etc/passwd"). If a
  share for the home directory of such a user was created (e.g. using the
  automated "[homes]" share), any user able to access that share could see
  the whole file system, possibly bypassing intended access restrictions.
  (CVE-2009-2813)

  The mount.cifs program printed CIFS passwords as part of its debug output
  when running in verbose mode. When mount.cifs had the setuid bit set, a
  local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to disclose passwords from a
  file that would otherwise be inaccessible to that user. Note: mount.cifs
  from the samba3x packages distributed by Red Hat does not have the setuid
  bit set. This flaw only affected systems where the setuid bit was manually
  set by an administrator. (CVE-2009-2948)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * the samba3x packages contained missing and conflicting license
  information. License information was missing for the libtalloc, libtdb, and
  tdb-tools packages. The samba3x-common package provided a COPYING file;
  however, it stated the license was GPLv2, while RPM metadata stated the
  licenses were either GPLv3 or LGPLv3. This update adds the correct
  licensing information to the samba3x-common, libsmbclient, libtalloc,
  libtdb, and tdb-tools packages. (BZ#528633)

  * the upstream Samba version in the samba3x packages distributed with the
  RHEA-2009:1399 update contained broken implementations of the Netlogon
  credential chain and SAMR access checks security subsystems. This prevented
  Samba from acting as a domain controller: Client systems could not join the
  domain; users could not authenticate; and systems could not access the user
  and group list. (BZ#524551)

  * this update resolves interoperability issues with Windows 7 and Windows
  Server 2008 R2. (BZ#529022)

  These packages upgrade Samba from version 3.3.5 to version 3.3.8. Refer to
  the Samba Release Notes for a list of changes between versions:
  http://samba.org/samba/history/

  Users of samba3x should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  these issues. After installing this update, the smb service will be
  restarted automatically.
