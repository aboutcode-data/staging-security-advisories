summary: |
  Updated Xpdf packages are available that fix a vulnerability where a
  malicious PDF document could run arbitrary code.

  [Updated 16 July 2003]
  Updated packages are now available, as the original errata packages did not
  fix all possible ways of exploiting this vulnerability.

  Xpdf is an X Window System based viewer for Portable Document Format
  (PDF) files.

  Martyn Gilmore discovered a flaw in various PDF viewers and readers. An
  attacker can embed malicious external-type hyperlinks that, if activated or
  followed by a victim, can execute arbitrary shell commands.   The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0434 to this issue.

  All users of Xpdf are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which
  contain a backported security patch that corrects this issue.
