  - CVE-2014-1948
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issues and multiple
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
  images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
  and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  An information leak flaw was found in the way glance stored certain logging
  information. An attacker with access to the glance log files could use this
  flaw to obtain authentication credentials to the OpenStack Object Storage
  (swift) back end. Note that only setups using the swift back end were
  affected. (CVE-2014-1948)

  The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1065313)

  All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the running OpenStack Image services must be manually restarted
  (using "service [service name] restart") for this update to take effect.
