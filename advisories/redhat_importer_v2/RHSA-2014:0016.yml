  - CVE-2013-4576
summary: |
  An updated gnupg package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a tool for encrypting data and
  creating digital signatures, compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet
  standard and the S/MIME standard.

  It was found that GnuPG was vulnerable to side-channel attacks via acoustic
  cryptanalysis. An attacker in close range to a target system that is
  decrypting ciphertexts could possibly use this flaw to recover the RSA
  secret key from that system. (CVE-2013-4576)

  Red Hat would like to thank Werner Koch of GnuPG upstream for reporting
  this issue. Upstream acknowledges Genkin, Shamir, and Tromer as the
  original reporters.

  All gnupg users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
