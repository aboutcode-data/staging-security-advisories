summary: |
  Updated tomcat5 packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A flaw was found in the way Tomcat handled the Transfer-Encoding header in
  HTTP requests. A specially-crafted HTTP request could prevent Tomcat from
  sending replies, or cause Tomcat to return truncated replies, or replies
  containing data related to the requests of other users, for all subsequent
  HTTP requests. (CVE-2010-2227)

  This erratum fixes two additional security flaws in Tomcat. In a typical
  operating environment, Tomcat is not exposed to users of Red Hat
  Certificate System in a vulnerable manner. These fixes will reduce risk in
  unique Certificate System environments. (CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902)

  Users of Red Hat Certificate System 7.3 should upgrade to these updated
  tomcat5 packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
  After installing the updated packages, the Red Hat Certificate System CA
  (rhpki-ca), DRM (rhpki-kra), OCSP (rhpki-ocsp), and TKS (rhpki-tks)
  subsystems must be restarted ("/etc/init.d/[instance-name] restart") for
  this update to take effect.
