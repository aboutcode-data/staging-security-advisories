  - CVE-2004-0817
summary: |
  An updated imlib package that fixes several heap overflows is now available.

  Imlib is an image loading and rendering library.

  Several heap overflow flaws were found in the imlib BMP image handler.   An
  attacker could create a carefully crafted BMP file in such a way that it
  could cause an application linked with imlib to execute arbitrary code when
  the file was opened by a victim.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0817 to this issue.

  Users of imlib should update to this updated package which contains
  backported patches and is not vulnerable to this issue.
