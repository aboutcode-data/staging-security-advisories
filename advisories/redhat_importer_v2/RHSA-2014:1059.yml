summary: |
  An update for the GateIn Portal component in JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.2 that fixes two security issues is now available from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
