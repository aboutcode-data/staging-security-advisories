  - CVE-2011-3193
summary: |
  Updated qt4 packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Qt 4 is a software toolkit that simplifies the task of writing and
  maintaining GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications for the X Window
  System. HarfBuzz is an OpenType text shaping engine.

  A flaw in the way Qt 4 expanded certain UTF-8 characters could be used to
  prevent a Qt 4 based application from properly sanitizing user input.
  Depending on the application, this could allow an attacker to perform
  directory traversal, or for web applications, a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack. (CVE-2007-0242)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the harfbuzz module in Qt 4. If a user
  loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against Qt
  4, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2011-3193)

  Users of Qt 4 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. All running applications linked
  against Qt 4 libraries must be restarted for this update to take effect.
