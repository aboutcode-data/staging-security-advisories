  - CVE-2014-2237
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and various
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
  OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
  The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication including
  user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style
  logins.

  The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.2.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the memcached token back end of OpenStack Identity
  did not correctly invalidate a revoked trust token, allowing users with
  revoked tokens to retain access to services they should no longer be able
  to access. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups using the memcached
  back end for tokens were affected. (CVE-2014-2237)

  All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue.
