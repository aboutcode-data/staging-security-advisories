summary: "Updated kernel packages that address several security vulnerabilites are\nnow available\
  \ for the IA64 architecture.\n\n[Updated 28 August 2003]\nChanged the CVE name listed in description\
  \ from the incorrect CAN-2002-0247\nto CAN-2003-0247\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic\
  \ functions of the operating system.\n\nAl Viro found a security issue in the tty layer in\
  \ which any user could\ncause a kernel oops. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n\
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0247 to this issue.\n \nA vulnerability in\
  \ the kernel's TCP/IP fragment reassembly handling allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial\
  \ of service (CPU consumption) via packets\nthat cause a large number of hash table collisions.\
  \ The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\n\
  CAN-2003-0364 to this issue.\n\nPaul Starzetz discovered a file read race condition in the\
  \ execve() system\ncall, which could cause a local crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and\n\
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0462 to\nthis issue.\n\n\
  The /proc file system under Linux allows local users to obtain sensitive\ninformation by opening\
  \ various entries in /proc/self before executing a\nsetuid program. This causes the program\
  \ to fail to change the ownership and\npermissions of already-opened entries. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0501 to\nthis issue.\n\
  \nThe STP protocol is known to have no security, which could allow attackers\nto alter the\
  \ bridge topology. STP is now turned off by default. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0550 to this issue.\n\nThe STP input\
  \ processing is lax in its length checking, which could lead to\na denial of service (DoS).\
  \ The kernel contained in this erratum improves\nSTP input processing. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0551 to this issue.\n\
  \nJerry Kreuscher discovered that the Forwarding table could be spoofed by\nsending forged\
  \ packets with bogus source addresses that are the same as the\nlocal host. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2003-0552 to this issue.\n\
  \nAn integer signedness error in the decode_fh function of nfs3xdr.c allows\nremote attackers\
  \ to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via a negative\nsize value within XDR data of\
  \ an NFSv3 procedure call.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0619 to this issue.\n\nThe C-Media PCI sound driver in unpatched\
  \ kernel versions prior to 2.4.21\naccesses userspace without using the get_user function,\
  \ which is a\npotential security hole.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n\
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0699 to this issue.\n\nIn addition, a number\
  \ of bugfixes and updates have been applied to the IA32\nemulation layer.\n\nAll users should\
  \ upgrade to these errata packages, which contain patches to\nthe 2.4.18 kernel that address\
  \ these issues."
