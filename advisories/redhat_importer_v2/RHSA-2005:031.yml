  - CVE-2004-1018
  - CVE-2004-1019
summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix various security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Web server.

  A double-free bug was found in the deserialization code of PHP. PHP
  applications use the unserialize function on untrusted user data, which
  could allow a remote attacker to gain access to memory or potentially
  execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1019 to this issue.

  Flaws were found in the pack and unpack PHP functions. These functions
  do not normally pass user supplied data, so they would require a malicious
  PHP script to be exploited. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1018 to this issue.

  A bug was discovered in the initialization of the OpenSSL library, such
  that the curl extension could not be used to perform HTTP requests over SSL
  unless the php-imap package was installed.

  Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain fixes
  for these issues.
