  - CVE-2016-6338
summary: |
  An update for org.ovirt.engine-root is now available for Red Hat Virtualization Manager version 4.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a centralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.

  The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: org.ovirt.engine-root (4.1.8.2). (BZ#1483576)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the ovirt-engine webadmin session would not properly enforce timeouts. Browser sessions would remain logged in beyond the administratively configured session timeout period. (CVE-2016-6338)

  This issue was discovered by Greg Sheremeta (Red Hat).

  Bug Fix(es):

  * You can now set the Initialization of a virtual machine to an empty value through the REST API. (BZ#1513684)

  Enhancement(s):

  * There are several cluster and host settings which require reinstallation of the host if changed. The requirement to reinstall was always mentioned in documentation and a WARNING event was raised. With this release, the Administration Portal now also shows an exclamation mark icon for each host that needs to be reinstalled. When an exclamation mark icon is shown, you can find the details about it in the Action Items section of the host's details view. (BZ#1501793)
