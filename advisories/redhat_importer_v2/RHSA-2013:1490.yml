summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way IP packets with an Internet Header Length
  (ihl) of zero were processed in the skb_flow_dissect() function in the
  Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger an infinite
  loop in the kernel, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-4348,
  Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation
  handled certain UDP packets when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
  feature was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
  system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2013-4387, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the creation of
  temporary IPv6 addresses. If the IPv6 privacy extension was enabled
  (/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/use_tempaddr set to '2'), an attacker on
  the local network could disable IPv6 temporary address generation, leading
  to a potential information disclosure. (CVE-2013-0343, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface
  Device) reports with an out-of-bounds Report ID. An attacker with physical
  access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888,
  Moderate)

  * Heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the
  Pantherlord/GreenAsia game controller driver, the Logitech force feedback
  drivers, and the Logitech Unifying receivers driver handled HID reports.
  An attacker with physical access to the system could use these flaws to
  crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2013-2892, CVE-2013-2893, CVE-2013-2895, Moderate)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the N-Trig touch
  screen driver handled HID reports. An attacker with physical access to the
  system could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in a denial of
  service. (CVE-2013-2896, Moderate)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's device
  mapper subsystem, under certain conditions, interpreted data written to
  snapshot block devices. An attacker could use this flaw to read data from
  disk blocks in free space, which are normally inaccessible. (CVE-2013-4299,
  Moderate)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the tun_set_iff() function in the
  Universal TUN/TAP device driver implementation in the Linux kernel.
  A privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially,
  further escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4343, Moderate)

  * An off-by-one flaw was found in the way the ANSI CPRNG implementation in
  the Linux kernel processed non-block size aligned requests. This could lead
  to random numbers being generated with less bits of entropy than expected
  when ANSI CPRNG was used. (CVE-2013-4345, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 SCTP implementation
  interacted with the IPsec subsystem. This resulted in unencrypted SCTP
  packets being sent over the network even though IPsec encryption was
  enabled. An attacker able to inspect these SCTP packets could use this flaw
  to obtain potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-4350, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Fujitsu for reporting CVE-2013-4299 and Stephan
  Mueller for reporting CVE-2013-4345. The CVE-2013-4348 issue was discovered
  by Jason Wang of Red Hat.

  Bug fix:

  * RoCE appeared to be supported in the MRG Realtime kernel even when the
  required user space packages from the HPN channel were not installed.
  The Realtime kernel now checks for the HPN channel packages before exposing
  the RoCE interfaces. RoCE devices appear as plain 10GigE devices if the
  needed HPN channel user space packages are not installed. (BZ#1012993)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
  kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt14, and correct these issues.
  The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
