  - CVE-2008-0887
summary: |
  An updated gnome-screensaver package that fixes a security flaw is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  gnome-screensaver is the GNOME project's official screen saver program.

  A flaw was found in the way gnome-screensaver verified user passwords. When
  a system used a remote directory service for login credentials, a local
  attacker able to cause a network outage could cause gnome-screensaver to
  crash, unlocking the screen. (CVE-2008-0887)

  Users of gnome-screensaver should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
