summary: |
  A patch for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
  innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
  Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
  simple enterprise solution.

  A flaw was found in the JBoss Remoting component. A remote attacker could
  use specially-crafted input to cause the JBoss Remoting listeners to become
  unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition for services
  communicating via JBoss Remoting sockets. (CVE-2010-3862)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ole Husgaard of eXerp.com for reporting this
  issue.
