  - CVE-2017-7509
summary: "An update is now available for Red Hat Certificate System 8 with Advanced Access.\n\
  \nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate.\
  \ A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity\
  \ rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\
  \nRed Hat Certificate System is a complete implementation of an enterprise software system\
  \ designed to manage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\
  \n* An input validation error was found in Red Hat Certificate System's handling of client\
  \ provided certificates. If the certreq field is not present in a certificate an assertion\
  \ error is triggered causing a denial of service. (CVE-2017-7509)\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously,\
  \ the Token Management System (TMS) required that certificates that were on hold must first\
  \ become valid before they can be revoked. This update removes that limitation, and it is\
  \ now possible to directly revoke currently on hold certificates. (BZ#1262000)\n\n* With this\
  \ update, Red Hat Certificate System instances can be installed using existing CA signing\
  \ certificate/keys. This existing CA can be a functional CA from a different vendor, or keys\
  \ or CSR generated to be signed by an external CA for the purpose of chaining it to a publicly\
  \ recognized CA. \n\nNote that this feature is only supported when installing with the \"\
  pkisilent\" tool, not when using the graphical user interface. Additionally, since the CSR\
  \ is generated externally prior to configuration of the CA instance and is not stored in the\
  \ NSS security databases, it should be understood that the CSR value attached to the \"ca.signing.certreq\"\
  \ variable stored inside the \"/var/lib/pki-ca/conf/CS.cfg\" file is a reconstruction of the\
  \ CSR created during configuration, and not the original CSR utilized to obtain the existing\
  \ CA certificate. (BZ#1280391)\n\n* Previously, a bug in CRLDistributionPointsExtension caused\
  \ some certificate profiles to encounter problems when being viewed in the Certificate Manager\
  \ graphical interface. This bug is now fixed, and aforementioned profile can now be viewed\
  \ normally. (BZ#1282589)\n\n* Previously, if access to a component such as an HSM or an LDAP\
  \ server was lost during Certificate Revocation List (CRL) generation, the CA could become\
  \ stuck in a loop that generated large amounts of log entries until the problem was resolved.\
  \ To avoid these scenarios, two new configuration parameters are being introduced in this\
  \ patch to allow the CA to slow down. (BZ#1290650)\n\n* A patch has been applied to the Token\
  \ Processing System (TPS) to ensure that the \"symmetricKeys.requiredVersion\" option is being\
  \ handled correctly in all cases. (BZ#1302103)\n\n* A patch has been applied to the Certificate\
  \ System Token Processing System (TPS) to fix a bug where existing objects were not always\
  \ cleared when enrolling over an active token. (BZ#1302116)\n\n* This update fixes a bug where\
  \ the Token Processing System (TPS) could not correctly execute re-enrollment operations (taking\
  \ a currently enrolled token and enrolling it again with new certificates) on some G&D smart\
  \ cards. (BZ#1320283)\n\n* The Token Processing System (TPS) could previously leave old data\
  \ in a token's Coolkey applet when re-enrolling the token with new certificates and keys.\
  \ This bug is now fixed, and only data associated with certificates which are actually on\
  \ the token is preserved after a successful re-enrollment. (BZ#1327653)\n\n* Previously, a\
  \ problem when setting the final life cycle state of a token at the end of a re-enrollment\
  \ operation could cause it to fail to report that it is properly enrolled. This bug is now\
  \ fixed, and re-enrolled token now report their \"enrolled\" status accurately. (BZ#1382376)\n\
  \n* Prior to this update, ECDSA certificates were issued with a NULL value in the \"parameter\"\
  \ field. These certificates were not compliant with the RFC 5758 specification which mandates\
  \ this field to be omitted completely. This bug has been fixed, and ECDSA certificates are\
  \ now issued without the \"parameter\" field. (BZ#1454414)"
