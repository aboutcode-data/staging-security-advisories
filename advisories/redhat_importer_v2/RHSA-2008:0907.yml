  - CVE-2008-3825
summary: |
  An updated pam_krb5 package that fixes a security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The pam_krb5 module allows Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) aware
  applications to use Kerberos to verify user identities by obtaining user
  credentials at log in time.

  A flaw was found in the pam_krb5 "existing_ticket" configuration option. If
  a system is configured to use an existing credential cache via the
  "existing_ticket" option, it may be possible for a local user to gain
  elevated privileges by using a different, local user's credential cache.
  (CVE-2008-3825)

  Red Hat would like to thank Stéphane Bertin for responsibly disclosing this
  issue.

  Users of pam_krb5 should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
