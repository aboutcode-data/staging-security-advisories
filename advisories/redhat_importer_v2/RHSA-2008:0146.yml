summary: |
  Updated gd packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The gd package contains a graphics library used for the dynamic creation of
  images such as PNG and JPEG.

  Multiple issues were discovered in the gd GIF image-handling code. A
  carefully-crafted GIF file could cause a crash or possibly execute code
  with the privileges of the application using the gd library.
  (CVE-2006-4484, CVE-2007-3475, CVE-2007-3476)

  An integer overflow was discovered in the gdImageCreateTrueColor()
  function, leading to incorrect memory allocations. A carefully crafted
  image could cause a crash or possibly execute code with the privileges of
  the application using the gd library. (CVE-2007-3472)

  A buffer over-read flaw was discovered. This could cause a crash in an
  application using the gd library to render certain strings using a
  JIS-encoded font. (CVE-2007-0455)

  A flaw was discovered in the gd PNG image handling code. A truncated PNG
  image could cause an infinite loop in an application using the gd library.
  (CVE-2007-2756)

  A flaw was discovered in the gd X BitMap (XBM) image-handling code. A
  malformed or truncated XBM image could cause a crash in an application
  using the gd library. (CVE-2007-3473)

  Users of gd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches which resolve these issues.
