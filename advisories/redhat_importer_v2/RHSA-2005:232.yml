  - CVE-2005-0398
summary: "An updated ipsec-tools package that fixes a bug in parsing of ISAKMP headers\nis now\
  \ available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\n\
  Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThe ipsec-tools package is used in conjunction with the IPsec\
  \ functionality\nin the linux kernel. The ipsec-tools package includes:\n\n- setkey, a program\
  \ to directly manipulate policies and SAs\n- racoon, an IKEv1 keying daemon\n\nA bug was found\
  \ in the way the racoon daemon handled incoming ISAKMP\nrequests.  It is possible that an\
  \ attacker could crash the racoon daemon by\nsending a specially crafted ISAKMP packet.  The\
  \ Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0398\
  \ to\nthis issue. \n\nAdditionally, the following issues have been fixed:\n- racoon mishandled\
  \ restarts in the presence of stale administration sockets.\n- on Red Hat Enterprise Linux\
  \ 4, racoon and setkey did not properly set up\n  forward policies, which prevented tunnels\
  \ from working.\n\nUsers of ipsec-tools should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\n\
  backported patches, and is not vulnerable to these issues."
