  - CVE-2005-1849
summary: |
  Updated zlib packages that fix a buffer overflow are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Zlib is a general-purpose lossless data compression library that is used
  by many different programs.

  A previous zlib update, RHSA-2005:569 (CAN-2005-2096) fixed a flaw in zlib
  that could allow a carefully crafted compressed stream to crash an
  application. While the original patch corrected the reported overflow,
  Markus Oberhumer discovered additional ways a stream could trigger an
  overflow.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted compressed stream
  that would cause an application to crash if the stream is opened by a user.
   As an example, an attacker could create a malicious PNG image file that
  would cause a Web browser or mail viewer to crash if the image is viewed.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
  the name CAN-2005-1849 to this issue.

  Note that the versions of zlib shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 2.1 and 3 are not vulnerable to this issue.

  All users should update to these errata packages that contain a patch
  from Mark Adler that corrects this issue.
