  This advisory contains the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.4.33. See the following advisory for the RPM packages for this release:

  Space precludes documenting all of the container images in this advisory. See the following Release Notes documentation, which will be updated shortly for this release, for details about these changes:

  This update fixes the following bugs among others:

  * Previously, there were broken connections to the API server that caused nodes to remain in the NotReady state. Detecting a broken network connection could take up to 15 minutes, during which the platform would remain unavailable. This is now fixed by setting the TCP_USER_TIMEOUT socket option, which controls how long transmitted data can be unacknowledged before the connection is forcefully closed. (BZ#1907939)

  * Previously, the quota controllers only worked on resources retrieved from the discovery endpoint, which might contain only a fraction of all resources due to a network error. This is now fixed by having the quota controllers periodically resync when new resources are observed from the discovery endpoint. (BZ#1910096)

  * Previously, the kuryr-controller was comparing security groups related to
  network policies incorrectly. This caused security rules related to a
  network policy to be recreated on every minor update of that network
  policy. This bug has been fixed, allowing network policy updates that
  already have existing rules to be preserved; network policy additions or
  deletions are performed, if needed. (BZ#1910221)
