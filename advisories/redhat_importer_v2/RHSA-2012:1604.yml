summary: |
  Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0, which fixes two security issues, various bugs,
  and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Fuse ESB Enterprise, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides an integration
  platform.

  This release of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 serves as a replacement for Fuse
  ESB Enterprise 7.0.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the
  Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 Release Notes for information on the most
  significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly
  from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible
  to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  cause the Jetty HTTP server (a component of Apache Karaf, used by Fuse ESB
  Enterprise) to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP
  request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash
  value. This update introduces a limit of 1000 on the number of parameters
  processed per request to mitigate this issue. (CVE-2011-4461)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
  arrays (hashes) in JRuby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
  inputs to a JRuby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
  a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
  could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
  take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, the Murmur
  hash function has been replaced with the Perl hash function.
  (CVE-2012-5370)

  Note: Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 ships JRuby as part of the camel-ruby
  component, which allows users to define Camel routes in Ruby. The default
  use of JRuby in Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 does not appear to expose this
  flaw. If the version of JRuby shipped with Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 was
  used to build a custom application, then this flaw could be exposed.

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4461. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Walde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4461.

  All users of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0.
