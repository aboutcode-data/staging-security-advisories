summary: |
  An update for lua is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The lua packages provide support for Lua, a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: lua (5.4.4).

  Security Fix(es):

  * lua: use after free allows Sandbox Escape (CVE-2021-44964)

  * lua: stack overflow in lua_resume of ldo.c allows a DoS via a crafted script file (CVE-2021-43519)
