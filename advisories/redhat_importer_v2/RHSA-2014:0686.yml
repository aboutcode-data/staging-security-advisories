summary: |
  Updated tomcat packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  It was found that a fix for a previous security flaw introduced a
  regression that could cause a denial of service in Tomcat 7. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of CPU on the
  Tomcat server by sending a specially crafted request to that server.
  (CVE-2014-0186)

  It was found that when Tomcat 7 processed a series of HTTP requests in
  which at least one request contained either multiple content-length
  headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding
  header, Tomcat would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.
  (CVE-2013-4286)

  It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a
  denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat 7 processed chunk extensions and
  trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could
  consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that
  chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322)

  All Tomcat 7 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be
  restarted for this update to take effect.
