summary: |
  Updated php54 collection packages that fix multiple security issues and
  several bugs are now available as part of Red Hat Software Collections 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  [Updated 5 June 2015]
  This advisory has been updated to list previously unlisted security issues
  corrected in this update, including CVE-2015-3330 that has been rated as
  having Important security impact. Consequently, the overall impact of this
  advisory has been changed to Important. No changes have been made to the
  packages.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server. The php54 packages provide a recent stable release of PHP with
  the PEAR 1.9.4, APC 3.1.15, and memcache 3.0.8 PECL extensions, and a
  number of additional utilities.

  The php54 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 5.4.40, which
  provides a number of bug fixes over the version shipped in Red Hat Software
  Collections 1. (BZ#1168193)

  The following security issues were fixed in the php54-php component:

  A flaw was found in the way the PHP module for the Apache httpd web server
  handled pipelined requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  trigger the execution of a PHP script in a deinitialized interpreter,
  causing it to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-3330)

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in PHP's Exif extension. A
  specially crafted JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the
  exif_read_data() function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running that PHP application.
  (CVE-2015-0232)

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the way PHP performed object
  unserialization. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
  function could cause a PHP application to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8142, CVE-2015-0231, CVE-2015-0273,
  CVE-2015-2787, CVE-2015-4147, CVE-2015-4148)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way the way PHP's Phar extension parsed
  Phar archives. A specially crafted archive could cause PHP to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2015-2783,
  CVE-2015-3307, CVE-2015-3329)

  A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the enchant_broker_request_dict()
  function of PHP's enchant extension. An attacker able to make a PHP
  application enchant dictionaries could possibly cause it to crash.
  (CVE-2014-9705)

  A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in PHP's regular expression
  extension. An attacker able to make PHP process a specially crafted regular
  expression pattern could cause it to crash and possibly execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2015-2305)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the GD library used by the PHP gd
  extension. A specially crafted GIF file could cause a PHP application using
  the imagecreatefromgif() function to crash. (CVE-2014-9709)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in PHP's phar (PHP Archive) extension.
  An attacker able to trigger certain error condition in phar archive
  processing could possibly use this flaw to disclose certain portions of
  server memory. (CVE-2015-2301)

  An ouf-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way the File Information
  (fileinfo) extension processed certain Pascal strings. A remote attacker
  could cause a PHP application to crash if it used fileinfo to identify the
  type of the attacker-supplied file. (CVE-2014-9652)

  It was found that PHP move_uploaded_file() function did not properly handle
  file names with a NULL character. A remote attacker could possibly use this
  flaw to make a PHP script access unexpected files and bypass intended file
  system access restrictions. (CVE-2015-2348)

  A flaw was found in the way PHP handled malformed source files when running
  in CGI mode. A specially crafted PHP file could cause PHP CGI to crash.
  (CVE-2014-9427)

  The following security issue was fixed in the php54-php-pecl-zendopcache
  component:

  A use-after-free flaw was found in PHP's OPcache extension. This flaw could
  possibly lead to a disclosure of a portion of the server memory.
  (CVE-2015-1351)

  All php54 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. After installing the updated packages, the httpd
  service must be restarted for the update to take effect.
