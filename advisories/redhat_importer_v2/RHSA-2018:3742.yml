  - CVE-2018-1002105
summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform 3.x which allows for compromise of pods running on a compute node to which a pod is scheduled with normal user privilege. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers. Additionally, on versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘servicecatalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services. (CVE-2018-1002105)

  This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.2.z. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:
