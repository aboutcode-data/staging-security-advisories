  - CVE-2007-2873
summary: |
  Updated spamassassin packages that fix a security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SpamAssassin provides a way to reduce unsolicited commercial email (spam)
  from incoming email.

  Martin Krafft discovered a symlink issue in SpamAssassin that affects
  certain non-default configurations. A local user could use this flaw to
  create or overwrite files writable by the spamd process (CVE-2007-2873).

  Users of SpamAssassin should upgrade to these updated packages which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

  Note: This issue did not affect the version of SpamAssassin shipped with
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.
