  - CVE-2013-4477
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack Identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  A flaw was discovered in the way the LDAP backend in keystone handled the
  removal of a role. A user could unintentionally be granted a role if the
  role being removed had not been previously granted to that user. Note that
  only OpenStack Identity setups using an LDAP backend were affected.
  (CVE-2013-4477)

  All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
