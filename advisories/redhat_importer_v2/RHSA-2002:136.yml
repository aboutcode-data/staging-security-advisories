  - CVE-2002-0653
summary: "Updated mod_ssl packages are now available for Red Hat Advanced Server.\nThese updates\
  \ incorporate a fix for an incorrect bounds check in versions\nof mod_ssl up to and including\
  \ version 2.8.9.\n\nThe mod_ssl module provides strong cryptography for the Apache Web\nserver\
  \ via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security\n(TLS) protocols.  Versions\
  \ of mod_ssl prior to 2.8.10 are subject to a\nsingle NULL overflow that can cause arbitrary\
  \ code execution.\n\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the Apache Web server has to\
  \ be\nconfigured to allow overriding of configuration settings on a per-directory\nbasis,\
  \ and untrusted local users must be able to modify a directory in\nwhich the server is configured\
  \ to allow overriding.  The local attacker may\nthen become the user that Apache is running\
  \ as (usually 'www' or 'nobody').  \n\nNote that regardless of this bug, local users can obtain\
  \ the same\nprivileges if the server is configured to allow them to create CGI scripts\nwhich\
  \ run as the Web server user, or if PHP is enabled but not configured\nin \"safe mode\".\n\
  \nThe errata packages contain versions of mod_ssl that have been patched and\nare not vulnerable\
  \ to this issue.\n\nPlease note that you must restart the httpd daemon to use the updated\n\
  module. For instructions on doing this, see the bottom of the Solutions\nsection below."
