  - CVE-2016-7060
summary: |
  An update for tfm-rubygem-fusor_ui is now available for Red Hat QCI 1.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  QuickStart Cloud Installer (QCI) is designed to drastically simplify the deployment experience of provisioning your private cloud infrastructure by orchestrating the installation work flow across different products. Instead of installing each product separately, QCI provides an intuitive, web-based graphical user interface to provision a fully functional cloud environment based on the combination of products selected by the user.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that several password fields in QCI failed to properly mask the password while it was being entered. An attacker with physical access or the ability to view the screen would be able to see the passwords as they are being entered, allowing them to later access accounts and services protected by those passwords. (CVE-2016-7060)

  This issue was discovered by QCI QE Team (Red Hat).
