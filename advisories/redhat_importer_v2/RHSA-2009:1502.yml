summary: |
  Updated kdegraphics packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop
  Environment, including KPDF, a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
  files.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in KPDF. An attacker could
  create a malicious PDF file that would cause KPDF to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-1188,
  CVE-2009-3604, CVE-2009-3606, CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

  Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting the CVE-2009-3604
  issue, and Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608 issue.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve these issues.
