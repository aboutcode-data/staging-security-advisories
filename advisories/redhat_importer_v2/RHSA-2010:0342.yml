  - CVE-2010-0008
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * a flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel
  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote
  attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system,
  resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2010-0008, Important)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0111 introduced a
  regression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using
  the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for
  such devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid
  options:

  "Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported not
  setting wol"

  This update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for
  network devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#565495)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
