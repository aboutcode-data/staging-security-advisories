summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  It was discovered that request dispatchers did not properly normalize user
  requests that have trailing query strings, allowing remote attackers to
  send specially-crafted requests that would cause an information leak.
  (CVE-2008-5515)

  A flaw was found in the way the Tomcat AJP (Apache JServ Protocol)
  connector processes AJP connections. An attacker could use this flaw to
  send specially-crafted requests that would cause a temporary denial of
  service. (CVE-2009-0033)

  It was discovered that the error checking methods of certain authentication
  classes did not have sufficient error checking, allowing remote attackers
  to enumerate (via brute force methods) usernames registered with
  applications running on Tomcat when FORM-based authentication was used.
  (CVE-2009-0580)

  It was discovered that web applications containing their own XML parsers
  could replace the XML parser Tomcat uses to parse configuration files. A
  malicious web application running on a Tomcat instance could read or,
  potentially, modify the configuration and XML-based data of other web
  applications deployed on the same Tomcat instance. (CVE-2009-0783)

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
