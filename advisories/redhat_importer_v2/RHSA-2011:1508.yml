  - CVE-2011-3481
summary: |
  Updated cyrus-imapd packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The cyrus-imapd packages contain a high-performance mail server with IMAP,
  POP3, NNTP, and Sieve support.

  An authentication bypass flaw was found in the cyrus-imapd NNTP server,
  nntpd. A remote user able to use the nntpd service could use this flaw to
  read or post newsgroup messages on an NNTP server configured to require
  user authentication, without providing valid authentication credentials.
  (CVE-2011-3372)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the cyrus-imapd IMAP server,
  imapd. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted mail message to a
  victim that would possibly prevent them from accessing their mail normally,
  if they were using an IMAP client that relies on the server threading IMAP
  feature. (CVE-2011-3481)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Cyrus IMAP project for reporting the
  CVE-2011-3372 issue. Upstream acknowledges Stefan Cornelius of Secunia
  Research as the original reporter of CVE-2011-3372.

  Users of cyrus-imapd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  the update, cyrus-imapd will be restarted automatically.
