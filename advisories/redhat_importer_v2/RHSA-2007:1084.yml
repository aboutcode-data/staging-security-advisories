summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the
  jar: URI scheme. It was possible for a malicious website to leverage this
  flaw and conduct a cross-site scripting attack against a user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-5947)

  Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processed certain malformed
  web content. A webpage containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey
  to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-5959)

  A race condition existed when Seamonkey set the "window.location" property
  for a webpage. This flaw could allow a webpage to set an arbitrary Referer
  header, which may lead to a Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack
  against websites that rely only on the Referer header for protection.
  (CVE-2007-5960)

  Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
