  - CVE-2017-1000368
summary: |
  An update for sudo is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Extended Lifecycle Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system administrators to provide certain users with the permission to execute privileged commands, which are used for system management purposes, without having to log in as root.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the original fix for CVE-2017-1000367 was incomplete. A flaw was found in the way sudo parsed tty information from the process status file in the proc filesystem. A local user with privileges to execute commands via sudo could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-1000368)
