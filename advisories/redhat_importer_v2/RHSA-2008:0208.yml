summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of some malformed web content. A
  web page containing such malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2008-1233, CVE-2008-1235, CVE-2008-1236, CVE-2008-1237)

  Several flaws were found in the display of malformed web content. A web
  page containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
  SeaMonkey user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-1234,
  CVE-2008-1238, CVE-2008-1241)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
