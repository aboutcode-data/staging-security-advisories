  - CVE-2016-9599
summary: |
  An update for puppet-tripleo is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  puppet-tripleo is a key component of the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director, which is a toolset for installing and managing a complete OpenStack environment.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An access-control flaw was discovered in puppet-tripleo's IPtables rules management, which allowed the creation of TCP/UDP rules with empty port values. Some API services in Red Hat OpenStack Platform director are not exposed to public networks, which meant their $public_ssl_port value was set to empty (for example, openstack-glance, which is deployed by default on both undercloud and overcloud). If SSL was enabled, a malicious user could use these open ports to gain access to unauthorized resources. (CVE-2016-9599)

  This issue was discovered by Ben Nemec (Red Hat).
