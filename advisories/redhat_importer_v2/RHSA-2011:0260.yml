summary: |
  Updated python packages that fix multiple security issues and three bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
  language.

  Multiple flaws were found in the Python rgbimg module. If an application
  written in Python was using the rgbimg module and loaded a
  specially-crafted SGI image file, it could cause the application to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2009-4134, CVE-2010-1449, CVE-2010-1450)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Python 2.3.4's time.strptime() function did not correctly handle the "%W"
  week number format string. This update backports the _strptime
  implementation from Python 2.3.6, fixing this issue. (BZ#436001)

  * Python 2.3.4's socket.htons() function returned partially-uninitialized
  data on IBM System z, generally leading to incorrect results. (BZ#513341)

  * Python 2.3.4's pwd.getpwuid() and grp.getgrgid() functions did not
  support the full range of user and group IDs on 64-bit architectures,
  leading to "OverflowError" exceptions for large input values. This update
  adds support for the full range of user and group IDs on 64-bit
  architectures. (BZ#497540)

  Users of Python should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
