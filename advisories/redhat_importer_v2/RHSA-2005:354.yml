summary: "Updated tetex packages that fix several integer overflows are now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nTeTeX is an implementation of TeX for Linux or UNIX systems. TeX takes\na text\
  \ file and a set of formatting commands as input and creates a\ntypesetter-independent .dvi\
  \ (DeVice Independent) file as output.\n\nA number of security flaws have been found affecting\
  \ libraries used\ninternally within teTeX.  An attacker who has the ability to trick a user\n\
  into processing a malicious file with teTeX could cause teTeX to crash or\npossibly execute\
  \ arbitrary code. \n\nA number of integer overflow bugs that affect Xpdf were discovered.\
  \ The\nteTeX package contains a copy of the Xpdf code used for parsing PDF files\nand is therefore\
  \ affected by these bugs. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the names CAN-2004-0888 and\nCAN-2004-1125 to these issues.\n\nA number of\
  \ integer overflow bugs that affect libtiff were discovered.  The\nteTeX package contains\
  \ an internal copy of libtiff used for parsing TIFF\nimage files and is therefore affected\
  \ by these bugs.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the\nnames CAN-2004-0803, CAN-2004-0804 and CAN-2004-0886 to these issues.\n\nAlso latex2html\
  \ is added to package tetex-latex for 64bit platforms.\n\nUsers of teTeX should upgrade to\
  \ these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable to these\
  \ issues."
