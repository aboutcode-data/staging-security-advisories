summary: |
  Updated nss and nspr packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications.

  Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI
  operating system facilities.

  It was found that a Certificate Authority (CA) issued fraudulent HTTPS
  certificates. This update renders any HTTPS certificates signed by that CA
  as untrusted. This covers all uses of the certificates, including SSL,
  S/MIME, and code signing. (BZ#734316)

  Note: This fix only applies to applications using the NSS Builtin Object
  Token. It does not render the certificates untrusted for applications that
  use the NSS library, but do not use the NSS Builtin Object Token.

  These updated packages upgrade NSS to version 3.12.10 on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 and 5. As well, they upgrade NSPR to version 4.8.8 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, as required by the NSS update. The packages for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 include a backported patch.

  All NSS and NSPR users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. After installing the update, applications using NSS and
  NSPR must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
