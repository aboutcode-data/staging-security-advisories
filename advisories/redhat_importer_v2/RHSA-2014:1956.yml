  - CVE-2014-3686
summary: |
  An updated wpa_supplicant package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The wpa_supplicant package contains an 802.1X Supplicant with support for
  WEP, WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and various EAP authentication
  methods. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator for client
  stations and controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication and
  association of the WLAN driver.

  A command injection flaw was found in the way the wpa_cli utility executed
  action scripts. If wpa_cli was run in daemon mode to execute an action
  script (specified using the -a command line option), and wpa_supplicant was
  configured to connect to a P2P group, malicious P2P group parameters could
  cause wpa_cli to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3686)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jouni Malinen for reporting this issue.

  All wpa_supplicant users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
