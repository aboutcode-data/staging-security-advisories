summary: |
  Updated gdk-pixbuf packages that fix several security flaws are now available.

  The gdk-pixbuf package contains an image loading library used with the
  GNOME GUI desktop environment.

  [Updated 15th September 2004]
  Packages have been updated to correct a bug which caused the xpm loader
  to fail.

  During testing of a previously fixed flaw in Qt (CAN-2004-0691), a flaw was
  discovered in the BMP image processor of gdk-pixbuf.  An attacker could
  create a carefully crafted BMP file which would cause an application
  to enter an infinite loop and not respond to user input when the file was
  opened by a victim.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0753 to this issue.

  During a security audit, Chris Evans discovered a stack and a heap overflow
  in the XPM image decoder. An attacker could create a carefully crafted XPM
  file which could cause an application linked with gtk2 to crash or possibly
  execute arbitrary code when the file was opened by a victim.
  (CAN-2004-0782, CAN-2004-0783)

  Chris Evans also discovered an integer overflow in the ICO image decoder.
  An attacker could create a carefully crafted ICO file which could cause an
  application linked with gtk2 to crash when the file is opened by a victim.
  (CAN-2004-0788)

  These packages have also been updated to correct a bug which caused the xpm
  loader to fail.

  Users of gdk-pixbuf are advised to upgrade to these packages, which
  contain backported patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.
