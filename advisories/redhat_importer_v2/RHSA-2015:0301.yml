  - CVE-2014-9273
summary: |
  Updated hivex packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Hive files are undocumented binary files that Windows uses to store the
  Windows Registry on disk. Hivex is a library that can read and write to
  these files.

  It was found that hivex attempted to read beyond its allocated buffer when
  reading a hive file with a very small size or with a truncated or
  improperly formatted content. An attacker able to supply a specially
  crafted hive file to an application using the hivex library could possibly
  use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running that application. (CVE-2014-9273)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mahmoud Al-Qudsi of NeoSmart Technologies for
  reporting this issue.

  The hivex package has been upgraded to upstream version 1.3.10, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#1023978)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Due to an error in the hivex_value_data_cell_offset() function, the hivex
  utility could, in some cases, print an "Argument list is too long" message
  and terminate unexpectedly when processing hive files from the Windows
  Registry. This update fixes the underlying code and hivex now processes
  hive files as expected. (BZ#1145056)

  * A typographical error in the Win::Hivex.3pm manual page has been
  corrected. (BZ#1099286)

  Users of hivex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and adds these enhancements.
