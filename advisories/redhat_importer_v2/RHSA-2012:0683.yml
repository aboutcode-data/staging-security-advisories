  - CVE-2012-2134
summary: |
  An updated bind-dyndb-ldap package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The dynamic LDAP back end is a plug-in for BIND that provides back-end
  capabilities to LDAP databases. It features support for dynamic updates
  and internal caching that help to reduce the load on LDAP servers.

  A flaw was found in the way bind-dyndb-ldap handled LDAP query errors. If a
  remote attacker were able to send DNS queries to a named server that is
  configured to use bind-dyndb-ldap, they could trigger such an error with a
  DNS query leveraging bind-dyndb-ldap's insufficient escaping of the LDAP
  base DN (distinguished name). This would result in an invalid LDAP query
  that named would retry in a loop, preventing it from responding to other
  DNS queries. With this update, bind-dyndb-ldap only attempts to retry one
  time when an LDAP search returns an unexpected error. (CVE-2012-2134)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ronald van Zantvoort for reporting this issue.

  All bind-dyndb-ldap users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, the named service must be restarted.
