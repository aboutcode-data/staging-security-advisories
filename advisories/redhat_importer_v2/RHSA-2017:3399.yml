  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

  This asynchronous patch is a security update for log4j package in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
