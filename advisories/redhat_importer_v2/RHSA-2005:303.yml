  - CVE-2005-0667
summary: |
  An updated sylpheed package that fixes a buffer overflow issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Sylpheed is a GTK+ based fast email client.

  A buffer overflow bug has been found in the way Sylpheed handles non-ASCII
  characters in the header of a message to which a victim replies.  A
  carefully crafted email message could potentially allow an attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine if they reply to such a
  message. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2005-0667 to this issue.

  Users of Sylpheed should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.
