  - CVE-2014-0107
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0, which fixes one
  security issue and one bug, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
  which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam.

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  It was observed that when using the Transfomer to convert a StreamSource to
  DOMResult, the performance of the conversion degraded as the size of the
  character data increased. For example, converting a 50 MB XML BLOB would
  take a very long time to finish. This issue has been resolved in this
  release by adjusting both the SAX2DOM and DOMBuilder classes to handle
  larger inputs more efficiently. (JBPAPP-10991)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The JBoss
  server process must be restarted for this update to take effect.
