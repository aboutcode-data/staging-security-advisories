  - CVE-2015-5295
summary: "Updated openstack-heat packages that fix one security issue and resolve\nvarious bugs\
  \ are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack\nPlatform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.\n\
  \nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security\nimpact. Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings,\
  \ are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\n\
  OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify\nand deploy configurations\
  \ for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking.\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the\
  \ OpenStack Orchestration \nservice (heat), where a specially formatted template could be\
  \ used to\ntrick the heat-engine service into opening a local file. Although the\nfile contents\
  \ are never disclosed to the end user, an OpenStack-\nauthenticated attacker could use this\
  \ flaw to cause a denial of service\nor determine whether a given file name is present on\
  \ the server.\n(CVE-2015-5295)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Steven Hardy of Red Hat.\n\n\
  This update has the following known issue:\n\n* By default, the number of created heat-engine\
  \ workers match the number of \ncores on the undercloud. However, if there is only one core,\
  \ there is only \none heat-engine worker, and this causes deadlocks when creating the \novercloud\
  \ stack. A single heat-engine worker is not enough to launch an \novercloud stack. Workaround:\
  \ The undercloud must have at least two \n(virtual) cores. For virtual deployments, this should\
  \ be two vCPUs, \nregardless of cores on the baremetal host. Otherwise, you can uncomment\
  \ the \nnum_engine_workers line in /etc/heat/heat.conf,  and restart openstack-\nheat-engine.\
  \ (BZ#1290949)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When a stack update fails,\
  \ Orchestration stores a merged environment \nfile. Previously, with an interrupted update,\
  \ the merged environment file \nwas not written, any resources already created that had new\
  \ type aliases in \nthe environment could not have their types resolved, and the failed stack\
  \ \ncould not be updated. This patch now catches any exceptions that occur, and \nensures\
  \ that the stack can now be updated. (BZ#1290950)\n\n* Previously, stack updates resulted\
  \ in an OS::Neutron::Port resource\nbeing replaced when the property values were changed in\
  \ the following\nways:\n  - The network property referred to the same network, but by name\
  \ instead\n    of UUID, or by UUID instead of name.\n  - Specifying the network using the\
  \ 'network' property instead of the\n    deprecated 'network_id' property, or using the deprecated\
  \ 'network_id'\n    property instead of the network property.\nThis issue has been resolved.\
  \ (BZ#1291845)\n\n* This update resolves an issue that caused the deployment of Orchestration\n\
  templates to fail during resource validation. Network IDs are now correctly \nidentified.\
  \ (BZ#1292152)\n\n* Previously, using the Orchestration API actions > check call removed \n\
  output values from the existing stack (using either CLI or dashboard). This \nbroke stack\
  \ updates and other operations depending on stack output values \nafter operation execution.\
  \ This issue has been resolved. (BZ#1299257)\n\n* Upgrades of overclouds from Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux OpenStack\nPlatform 7.2 to 7.3 failed with the error \n\"resources.SwiftDevicesAndProxyConfig:\
  \ Property \ncontroller_swift_proxy_memcaches_v6 not assigned\". This issue has been\nresolved.\
  \ (BZ#1300847)\n\n* Previously, when resource metadata was requested from Orchestration, all\
  \  \nattribute values were fetched, even though this data was not returned by \nthe API. This\
  \ meant at least one pointless ReST API call to the OpenStack \nservice, and \"404 Not Found\"\
  \ messages accumulated in both heat-engine and \nnova-api logs. With this update, Orchestration\
  \ no longer calculates \nattribute values when only the metadata for a resource is requested.\n\
  (BZ#1304854)\n\n* Previously, the \"heat-manage purge_delete\" cron job on the undercloud\
  \ \nfailed when attempting to purge the raw_template table. This patch fixes \nthe raw_template\
  \ purge query on MySQL, and handles stack tags before \nremoving stacks which resolves the\
  \ issue and also removes some race \nconditions where incorrect data was being deleted.(BZ#1306444)"
