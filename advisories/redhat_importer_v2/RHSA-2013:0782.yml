aliases:
  - CVE-2013-0166
  - CVE-2013-0169
summary: |
  An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0
  for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes two security issues is now
  available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
  in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
  applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
  response. (CVE-2013-0166)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
  padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and
  configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 for Solaris and Microsoft
  Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply
  this update.
