aliases:
  - CVE-2002-0392
summary: |
  The Apache Web server contains a security vulnerability which can be used
  to launch a denial of service attack or, in some cases, allow remote code
  execution.

  Versions of the Apache Web server up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug
  in the routines which deal with requests using "chunked" encoding.
  A carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child process to
  call the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the end of its
  buffer, corrupting the stack. On some platforms this can be remotely
  exploited -- allowing arbitrary code to be run on the server.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.

  We have backported the security fix from the official Apache 1.3.26
  release. This should help minimize the impact of upgrading to our errata
  packages.

  All users of Apache should update to these errata packages to correct this
  security issue.

  [Update Jun 26 2002]
  Updated packages have been added for Red Hat Linux for S/390.  Slight
  changes to problem description to take into account possibility of exploits
  also on 32-bit platforms.
