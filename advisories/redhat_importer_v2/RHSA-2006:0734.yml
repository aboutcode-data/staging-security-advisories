summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processes certain malformed
  Javascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of
  Javascript code in such a way that could cause SeaMonkey to crash or
  execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2006-5463,
  CVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)

  Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey renders web pages. A
  malicious web page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute
  arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2006-5464)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys
  with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that
  would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. SeaMonkey as shipped
  trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An
  attacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be
  incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was
  previously thought to be fixed in SeaMonkey 1.0.5, however Ulrich Kuehn
  discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

  Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
  contains SeaMonkey version 1.0.6 that corrects these issues.
