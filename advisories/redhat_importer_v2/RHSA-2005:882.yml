summary: "Updated versions of cross-platform Stronghold that fix security issues in\nmod_ssl,\
  \ mod_imap, OpenSSL, and PHP are now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nStronghold 4 contains a number\
  \ of open source technologies, including\nmod_ssl and the Apache HTTP Server.\n\nSeveral security\
  \ issues have been found that affect cross-platform\nStronghold 4: \n\nA flaw in mod_imap\
  \ when using the Referer directive with image maps.  With\ncertain site configurations, a\
  \ remote attacker could perform a cross-site\nscripting attack if a victim can be forced to\
  \ visit a malicious URL using\ncertain web browsers. (CVE-2005-3352) \n\nA flaw in mod_ssl\
  \ triggered if a virtual host was configured using\n\"SSLVerifyClient optional\" and a directive\
  \ \"SSLVerifyClient required\" is\nset for a specific location.  For servers configured in\
  \ this fashion, an\nattacker may be able to access resources that should otherwise be\nprotected.\
  \  (CVE-2005-2700) \n\nFlaws in shmop_write, pack, and unpack PHP functions.  These functions\
  \ are\nnot normally passed user-supplied data, so would require a malicious PHP\nscript to\
  \ be exploited.  (CVE-2004-1018) \n\nVarious flaws, including possible information disclosure,\
  \ double free, and\nnegative reference index array underflow in the deserialization code of\n\
  PHP.  PHP applications may use the unserialize function of untrusted user\ndata, which could\
  \ allow a remote attacker to gain access to memory or\npotentially execute arbitrary code.\
  \  (CVE-2004-1019) \n\nA flaw in the way PHP registers global variables during a file upload\n\
  request.  A remote attacker could submit a carefully crafted\nmultipart/form-data POST request\
  \ that would overwrite the $GLOBALS array,\naltering expected script behavior, and possibly\
  \ leading to the execution of\narbitrary PHP commands. Note that this vulnerability only affects\n\
  installations which have register_globals enabled in the PHP configuration\nfile, which is\
  \ not a default or recommended option.  (CVE-2005-3390)\n\nA flaw in the PHP parse_str() function.\
  \ If a PHP script passes only one\nargument to the parse_str() function, and the script can\
  \ be forced to abort\nexecution during operation (for example due to the memory_limit setting),\n\
  the register_globals may be enabled even if it is disabled in the PHP\nconfiguration file.\
  \ This vulnerability only affects installations that have\nPHP scripts using the parse_str\
  \ function in this way. (CVE-2005-3389)\n\nA Cross-Site Scripting flaw in the phpinfo() function.\
  \ If a victim can be\ntricked into following a malicious URL to a site with a page displaying\
  \ the\nphpinfo() output, it may be possible to inject javascript or HTML content\ninto the\
  \ displayed page or steal data such as cookies.  This vulnerability\nonly affects installations\
  \ that allow users to view the output of the\nphpinfo() function.  As the phpinfo() function\
  \ outputs a large amount of\ninformation about the current state of PHP, it should only be\
  \ used during\ndebugging or if protected by authentication. (CVE-2005-3388) \n\nOpenSSL contained\
  \ a software work-around for a bug in SSL handling in\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer version\
  \ 3.0.2.  This work-around is enabled in\nmost servers that use OpenSSL to provide support\
  \ for SSL and TLS.  Yutaka\nOiwa discovered that this work-around could allow an attacker,\
  \ acting as a\n\"man in the middle\", to force an SSL connection to use SSL 2.0 rather than\n\
  a stronger protocol such as SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0.  (CAN-2005-2969)\n\nColin Percival reported\
  \ a cache timing attack that could allow a malicious\nlocal user to gain portions of cryptographic\
  \ keys.  The OpenSSL library has\nbeen patched to add a new fixed-window mod_exp implementation\
  \ as default\nfor RSA, DSA, and DH private-key operations.  This patch is designed to\nmitigate\
  \ cache timing and potentially related attacks.  (CVE-2005-0109)\n\nStronghold users are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues."
