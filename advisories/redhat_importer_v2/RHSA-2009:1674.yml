summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2009-3979, CVE-2009-3981, CVE-2009-3986)

  A flaw was found in the Firefox NT Lan Manager (NTLM) authentication
  protocol implementation. If an attacker could trick a local user that has
  NTLM credentials into visiting a specially-crafted web page, they could
  send arbitrary requests, authenticated with the user's NTLM credentials, to
  other applications on the user's system. (CVE-2009-3983)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the SSL location bar
  indicator. An attacker could create an unencrypted web page that appears to
  be encrypted, possibly tricking the user into believing they are visiting a
  secure page. (CVE-2009-3984)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed blank pages after a user
  navigates to an invalid address. If a user visits an attacker-controlled
  web page that results in a blank page, the attacker could inject content
  into that blank page, possibly tricking the user into believing they are
  viewing a legitimate page. (CVE-2009-3985)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 3.0.16. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this errata.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 3.0.16, which corrects these issues. After installing the
  update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
