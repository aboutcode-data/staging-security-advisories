summary: |
  Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.3.3 and fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and add various
  enhancements are now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the RESTEasy DocumentProvider did not set the
  external-parameter-entities and external-general-entities features
  appropriately, thus allowing external entity expansion. A remote attacker
  able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use this flaw to
  read files accessible to the user running the application server, and
  potentially perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.
  (CVE-2014-7839)

  It was discovered that the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
  did not sufficiently verify all authorization conditions that are required
  by the Maintainer role to perform certain administrative actions.
  An authenticated user with the Maintainer role could use this flaw to add,
  modify, or undefine a limited set of attributes and their values, which
  otherwise cannot be written to. (CVE-2014-7849)

  It was discovered that the JBoss Application Server (WildFly) JacORB
  subsystem incorrectly assigned socket-binding-ref sensitivity
  classification for the security-domain attribute. An authenticated user
  with a role that has access to attributes with socket-binding-ref and not
  security-domain-ref sensitivity classification could use this flaw to
  access sensitive information present in the security-domain attribute.
  (CVE-2014-7853)

  It was found that when processing undefined security domains, the
  org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation would
  fall back to the default security domain if it was available. A user with
  valid credentials in the defined default domain, with a role that is valid
  in the expected application domain, could perform actions that were
  otherwise not available to them. When using the SAML2 STS Login Module,
  JBossMappingManager exposed this issue due to the PicketLink Trust
  SecurityActions implementation using a hardcoded default value when
  defining the context. (CVE-2014-7827)

  It was discovered that under specific conditions the conversation state
  information stored in a thread-local variable was not sanitized correctly
  when the conversation ended. This could lead to a race condition that could
  potentially expose sensitive information from a previous conversation to
  the current conversation. (CVE-2014-8122)

  Red Hat would like to thank Rune Steinseth of JProfessionals for reporting
  the CVE-2014-8122 issue. The CVE-2014-7849 and CVE-2014-7853 issues were
  discovered by Darran Lofthouse of the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform Team, and the CVE-2014-7827 issue was discovered by Ondra Lukas of
  the Red Hat Quality Engineering Team.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.3.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes is available from the link in the
  References section.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
