  - CVE-2009-0846
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  An input validation flaw was found in the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation
  One) decoder used by MIT Kerberos. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash a network service using the MIT Kerberos library, such as kadmind or
  krb5kdc, by causing it to dereference or free an uninitialized pointer.
  (CVE-2009-0846)

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. All running services using the MIT
  Kerberos libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.
