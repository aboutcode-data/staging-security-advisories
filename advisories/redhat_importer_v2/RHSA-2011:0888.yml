summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed JPEG images. A
  website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause SeaMonkey to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2377)

  Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0083, CVE-2011-0085, CVE-2011-2363)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2364, CVE-2011-2365, CVE-2011-2374, CVE-2011-2375,
  CVE-2011-2376)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled JavaScript
  Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
  SeaMonkey to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user
  running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2371)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed
  JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause SeaMonkey
  to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-2373)

  It was found that SeaMonkey could treat two separate cookies as
  interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
  domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
  policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
  (CVE-2011-2362)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
