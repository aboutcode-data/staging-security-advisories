  - CVE-2011-2196
summary: |
  An updated jboss-seam.jar file for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3.0.CP05
  and 5.1.0 that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2011-1484 was incomplete: JBoss Seam 2
  did not block access to all malicious JBoss Expression Language (EL)
  constructs in page exception handling, allowing arbitrary Java methods to
  be executed. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code via a specially-crafted URL provided to certain applications based on
  the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly configured and enabled Java
  Security Manager would prevent exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2011-2196)

  Red Hat would like to thank the ObjectWorks+ Development Team at Nomura
  Research Institute for reporting this issue.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3.0.CP05 and 5.1.0 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update. Refer
  to the Solution section for information about installing the update.
