aliases:
  - CVE-2015-5307
  - CVE-2015-8104
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the x86 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is prone to
  a denial of service attack inside a virtualized environment in the form of
  an infinite loop in the microcode due to the way (sequential) delivering of
  benign exceptions such as #AC (alignment check exception) and #DB (debug
  exception) is handled. A privileged user inside a guest could use these
  flaws to create denial of service conditions on the host kernel.
  (CVE-2015-5307, CVE-2015-8104, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Serebrin of Google Inc. for reporting the
  CVE-2015-5307 issue.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
