summary: "Updated firefox packages that fix several security bugs are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Firefox is an open source Web\
  \ browser.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox processed certain malformed\nJavaScript\
  \ code. A web page containing malicious JavaScript code could\ncause Firefox to crash or potentially\
  \ execute arbitrary code as the user\nrunning Firefox. (CVE-2007-2867, CVE-2007-2868)\n\n\
  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain FTP PASV commands. A\nmalicious FTP server\
  \ could use this flaw to perform a rudimentary\nport-scan of machines behind a user's firewall.\
  \ (CVE-2007-1562)\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the way Firefox handled\n\
  certain form and cookie data. A malicious web site that is able to set\narbitrary form and\
  \ cookie data could prevent Firefox from\nfunctioning properly. (CVE-2007-1362, CVE-2007-2869)\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the addEventListener\nJavaScript method. A malicious\
  \ web site could use this method to access or\nmodify sensitive data from another web site.\
  \ (CVE-2007-2870)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed certain web content. A\n\
  malicious web page could generate content that would overlay user\ninterface elements such\
  \ as the hostname and security indicators, tricking \nusers into thinking they are visiting\
  \ a different site. (CVE-2007-2871)\n\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these erratum\
  \ packages, which\ncontain Firefox version 1.5.0.12 that corrects these issues."
