  - CVE-2016-2140
summary: "Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo)\nfor RHEL 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having Important \nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base \nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\
  \ \nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n\n[Updated March 14, 2016]\n\
  The original packages distributed with this advisory contained a bug that\ncould cause failures\
  \ with non-disk image backends. We have updated all\npackages to correct the bug.\n\nOpenStack\
  \ Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of \nvirtual machines, creating a redundant\
  \ and scalable cloud computing \nplatform. Compute provides the software, control panels,\
  \ and APIs \nrequired to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine \ninstances\
  \ and controlling access through users and projects.\n\nAn information-exposure flaw was found\
  \ in the OpenStack Compute (nova)\nresize and migrate functionality. An authenticated user\
  \ could write a\nmalicious qcow header to an ephemeral or root disk, referencing a block\n\
  device as a backing file. With a subsequent resize or migration, file\nsystem content on the\
  \ specified device would be leaked to the user. Only\nsetups using libvirt with raw storage\
  \ and \"use_cow_images = False\" were\naffected. (CVE-2016-2140)\n\nThis issue was discovered\
  \ by Matthew Booth of Red Hat.\n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages,\nwhich correct this issue."
