  - CVE-2011-3208
summary: |
  Updated cyrus-imapd packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The cyrus-imapd packages contain a high-performance mail server with IMAP,
  POP3, NNTP, and Sieve support.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the cyrus-imapd NNTP server, nntpd. A
  remote user able to use the nntpd service could use this flaw to crash the
  nntpd child process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the cyrus user. (CVE-2011-3208)

  Red Hat would like to thank Greg Banks for reporting this issue.

  Users of cyrus-imapd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  the update, cyrus-imapd will be restarted automatically.
