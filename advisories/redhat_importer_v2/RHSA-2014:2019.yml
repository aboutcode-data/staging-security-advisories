summary: |
  Updated Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.2 packages that
  fix three security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,
  6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was discovered that the Apache CXF incorrectly extracted the host name
  from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
  using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

  It was found that Apache WSS4J (Web Services Security for Java), as used by
  Apache CXF with the TransportBinding, did not, by default, properly enforce
  all security requirements associated with SAML SubjectConfirmation methods.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform various types of spoofing
  attacks on web service endpoints secured by WSS4j that rely on SAML for
  authentication. (CVE-2014-3623)

  The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
  Product Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.2 on Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
