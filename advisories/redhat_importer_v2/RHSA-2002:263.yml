summary: "The kernel in Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1 is vulnerable to a local\ndenial of\
  \ service attack.  Updated packages are available which address this\nvulnerability.\n\n[Updated\
  \ 28 August 2003]\nAdded CAN-2003-0461 to the list of security issues that were fixed by this\n\
  advisory (there are no changes to the packages themselves).\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the\
  \ basic functions of the operating system.\nA vulnerability in the Linux kernel has been discovered\
  \ in which a non-root\nuser can cause the machine to freeze. This kernel addresses the\nvulnerability.\
  \  \n\nNote: This bug is specific to the x86 architecture kernels only, and does\nnot affect\
  \ ia64 or other architectures.\n\nIn addition, /proc/tty/driver/serial reveals the exact number\
  \ of\ncharacters used in serial links, which could allow local users to obtain\npotentially\
  \ sensitive information such as password lengths.\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata\
  \ packages, which are not vulnerable\nto these issues.\n\nThanks go to Christopher Devine\
  \ for reporting the vulnerability on Bugtraq,\nand Petr Vandrovec for being the first to supply\
  \ a fix to the community."
