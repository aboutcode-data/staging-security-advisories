summary: |
  Updated httpd24-httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
  and extensible web server.

  A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in
  the mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page
  served by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module
  (MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd
  child process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user. (CVE-2014-0226)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the mod_cache httpd module.
  A malicious HTTP server could cause the httpd child process to crash when
  the Apache HTTP Server was used as a forward proxy with caching.
  (CVE-2013-4352)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the mod_proxy httpd module. A remote
  attacker could send a specially crafted request to a server configured as a
  reverse proxy using a threaded Multi-Processing Modules (MPM) that would
  cause the httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2014-0117)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module
  handled request body decompression (configured via the "DEFLATE" input
  filter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be
  decompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system
  memory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module
  executed CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.
  A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause
  the httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)

  All httpd24-httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
