  [Updated May 2, 2017]
  CVE-2016-8656 was originally listed as resolved with this erratum. However, this was incorrect, as that issue only affected RPM installations and not zip files as provided by this erratum.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816)

  * An EAP feature to download server log files allows logs to be available via GET requests making them vulnerable to cross-origin attacks. An attacker could trigger the user's browser to request the log files consuming enough resources that normal server functioning could be impaired. (CVE-2016-8627)

  * It was discovered that when configuring RBAC and marking information as sensitive, users with a Monitor role are able to view the sensitive information. (CVE-2016-7061)

  The CVE-2016-8627 issue was discovered by Darran Lofthouse and Brian Stansberry (Red Hat).
