  - CVE-2005-2929
summary: |
  An updated lynx package that corrects a security flaw is now available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Lynx is a text-based Web browser.

  An arbitrary command execute bug was found in the lynx "lynxcgi:" URI
  handler. An attacker could create a web page redirecting to a malicious URL
  which could execute arbitrary code as the user running lynx. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2005-2929 to
  this issue.

  Users should update to this erratum package, which contains a backported
  patch to correct this issue.
