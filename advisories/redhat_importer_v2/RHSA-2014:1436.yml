summary: |
  Updated X11 client libraries packages that fix multiple security issues,
  several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The X11 (Xorg) libraries provide library routines that are used within all
  X Window applications.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in the way various X11 client libraries handled certain protocol
  data. An attacker able to submit invalid protocol data to an X11 server via
  a malicious X11 client could use either of these flaws to potentially
  escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-1981, CVE-2013-1982,
  CVE-2013-1983, CVE-2013-1984, CVE-2013-1985, CVE-2013-1986, CVE-2013-1987,
  CVE-2013-1988, CVE-2013-1989, CVE-2013-1990, CVE-2013-1991, CVE-2013-2003,
  CVE-2013-2062, CVE-2013-2064)

  Multiple array index errors, leading to heap-based buffer out-of-bounds
  write flaws, were found in the way various X11 client libraries handled
  data returned from an X11 server. A malicious X11 server could possibly use
  this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  an X11 client. (CVE-2013-1997, CVE-2013-1998, CVE-2013-1999, CVE-2013-2000,
  CVE-2013-2001, CVE-2013-2002, CVE-2013-2066)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the XListInputDevices()
  function of X.Org X11's libXi runtime library handled signed numbers.
  A malicious X11 server could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running an X11 client. (CVE-2013-1995)

  A flaw was found in the way the X.Org X11 libXt runtime library used
  uninitialized pointers. A malicious X11 server could possibly use this flaw
  to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an X11
  client. (CVE-2013-2005)

  Two stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libX11, the
  Core X11 protocol client library, processed certain user-specified files.
  A malicious X11 server could possibly use this flaw to crash an X11 client
  via a specially crafted file. (CVE-2013-2004)

  The xkeyboard-config package has been upgraded to upstream version 2.11,
  which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous
  version. (BZ#1077471)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, updating the mesa-libGL package did not update the libX11
  package, although it was listed as a dependency of mesa-libGL. This bug has
  been fixed and updating mesa-libGL now updates all dependent packages as
  expected. (BZ#1054614)

  * Previously, closing a customer application could occasionally cause the X
  Server to terminate unexpectedly. After this update, the X Server no longer
  hangs when a user closes a customer application. (BZ#971626)

  All X11 client libraries users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
