  - CVE-2015-1815
summary: |
  Updated setroubleshoot packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The setroubleshoot packages provide tools to help diagnose SELinux
  problems. When Access Vector Cache (AVC) messages are returned, an alert
  can be generated that provides information about the problem and helps to
  track its resolution.

  It was found that setroubleshoot did not sanitize file names supplied in a
  shell command look-up for RPMs associated with access violation reports.
  An attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system
  by supplying a specially crafted file to the underlying shell command.
  (CVE-2015-1815)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for
  reporting this issue.

  All setroubleshoot users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
