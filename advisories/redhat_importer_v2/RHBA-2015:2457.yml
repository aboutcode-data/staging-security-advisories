  Updated icedtea-web packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the netX project. It also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the plug-in and Web Start implementations. IcedTea-Web now also contains PolicyEditor - a simple tool to configure Java policies.

  The icedtea-web packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.6.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. Notable changes include the following:

  * The IcedTea-Web documentation and man pages have been significantly expanded.
  * IcedTea-Web now supports bash completion.
  * The "Custom Policies" and "Run in Sandbox" features have been enhanced.
  * An -html switch has been implemented for the Java Web Start (JavaWS) framework, which can serve as a replacement of the AppletViewer program.
  * It is now possible to use IcedTea-Web to crate desktop and menu launchers for applets and JavaWS applications.
