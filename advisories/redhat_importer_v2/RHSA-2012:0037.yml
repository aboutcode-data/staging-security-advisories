  - CVE-2011-4608
summary: |
  An updated mod_cluster-native package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  mod_cluster-native provides a native build of mod_cluster for the Apache
  HTTP Server (httpd). mod_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like
  mod_jk, it uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to
  an application server node.

  It was found that mod_cluster allowed worker nodes to register on any
  virtual host (vhost), regardless of the security constraints applied to
  other vhosts. In a typical environment, there will be one vhost configured
  internally for worker nodes, and another configured externally for serving
  content. A remote attacker could use this flaw to register an
  attacker-controlled worker node via an external vhost that is not
  configured to apply security constraints, then use that worker node to
  serve malicious content, intercept credentials, and hijack user sessions.
  (CVE-2011-4608)

  Users of mod_cluster-native should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to resolve this issue. Refer to the Solution
  section for installation instructions.
