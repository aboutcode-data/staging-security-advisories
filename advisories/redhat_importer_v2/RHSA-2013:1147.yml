summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 roll up patch 3, which fixes three
  security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
  automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
  existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
  CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
  execution speed and quality.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss SOA
  Platform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security
  issues are also fixed with this release:

  The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
  hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
  subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
  that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

  A flaw in JRuby's JSON gem allowed remote attacks by creating different
  types of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of
  service attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
  create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It could
  also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
  injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

  It was discovered that JRuby's REXML library did not properly restrict XML
  entity expansion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service by tricking a Ruby application using REXML to read text nodes from
  specially-crafted XML content, which will result in REXML consuming large
  amounts of system memory. (CVE-2013-1821)

  Note: Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of
  the scripting_chain quickstart example application. The CVE-2013-0269 and
  CVE-2013-1821 flaws are not exposed unless the version of JRuby shipped
  with that quickstart is used by a deployed, custom application.

  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting
  CVE-2013-0269. Upstream acknowledges Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag and Ben
  Murphy as the original reporters of CVE-2013-0269.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  SOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
