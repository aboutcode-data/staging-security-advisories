  - CVE-2009-3563
summary: |
  An updated ntp package that fixes two security issues is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
  with a referenced time source.

  Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov discovered a flaw in the way ntpd handled
  certain malformed NTP packets. ntpd logged information about all such
  packets and replied with an NTP packet that was treated as malformed when
  received by another ntpd. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create
  an NTP packet reply loop between two ntpd servers via a malformed packet
  with a spoofed source IP address and port, causing ntpd on those servers to
  use excessive amounts of CPU time and fill disk space with log messages.
  (CVE-2009-3563)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
  malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an ntpq
  request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running the ntpq command. (CVE-2009-0159)

  All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
  update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.
