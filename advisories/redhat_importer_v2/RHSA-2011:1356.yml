  - CVE-2011-3380
summary: |
  Updated openswan packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Openswan is a free implementation of Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
  and Internet Key Exchange (IKE). IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide
  both authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to
  build secure tunnels through untrusted networks.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Openswan's pluto IKE
  daemon handled certain error conditions. A remote, unauthenticated attacker
  could send a specially-crafted IKE packet that would crash the pluto
  daemon. (CVE-2011-3380)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Openswan project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Paul Wouters as the original reporter.

  All users of openswan are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, the ipsec service will be restarted automatically.
