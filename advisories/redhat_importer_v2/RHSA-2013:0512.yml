summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The httpd packages contain the Apache HTTP Server (httpd), which is the
  namesake project of The Apache Software Foundation.

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the mod_negotiation Apache HTTP
  Server module. A remote attacker able to upload or create files with
  arbitrary names in a directory that has the MultiViews options enabled,
  could use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against users
  visiting the site. (CVE-2008-0455, CVE-2012-2687)

  It was discovered that mod_proxy_ajp, when used in configurations with
  mod_proxy in load balancer mode, would mark a back-end server as failed
  when request processing timed out, even when a previous AJP (Apache JServ
  Protocol) CPing request was responded to by the back-end. A remote
  attacker able to make a back-end use an excessive amount of time to
  process a request could cause mod_proxy to not send requests to back-end
  AJP servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end servers
  were marked as failed. (CVE-2012-4557)

  These updated httpd packages include numerous bug fixes and enhancements.
  Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users
  are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Technical Notes, linked
  to in the References, for information on the most significant of these
  changes.

  All users of httpd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will
  be restarted automatically.
