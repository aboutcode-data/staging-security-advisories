  - CVE-2012-0037
summary: "Updated raptor packages that fix one security issue are now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having\n\
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which\
  \ gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.\n\
  \nRaptor provides parsers for Resource Description Framework (RDF) files.\n\nAn XML External\
  \ Entity expansion flaw was found in the way Raptor processed\nRDF files. If an application\
  \ linked against Raptor were to open a \nspecially-crafted RDF file, it could possibly allow\
  \ a remote attacker to \nobtain a copy of an arbitrary local file that the user running the\n\
  application had access to. A bug in the way Raptor handled external\nentities could cause\
  \ that application to crash or, possibly, execute\narbitrary code with the privileges of the\
  \ user running the application.\n(CVE-2012-0037)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Timothy D.\
  \ Morgan of VSR for reporting this\nissue.\n\nAll Raptor users are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications\n\
  linked against Raptor must be restarted for this update to take effect."
