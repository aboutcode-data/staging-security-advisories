summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add three enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fixes:

  * RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a flaw in the ptrace implementation on Itanium
  systems. ptrace_check_attach() was not called during certain ptrace()
  requests. Under certain circumstances, a local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to call ptrace() on a process they do not own, giving them
  control over that process. (CVE-2010-0729, Important)

  * a flaw was found in the kernel's Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
  (ULE) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted ISO
  MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target system, resulting in a
  denial of service. (CVE-2010-1086, Important)

  * a use-after-free flaw was found in tcp_rcv_state_process() in the
  kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using IPv6 had
  the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote attacker
  could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic.
  (CVE-2010-1188, Important)

  * a divide-by-zero flaw was found in azx_position_ok() in the Intel High
  Definition Audio driver, snd-hda-intel. A local, unprivileged user could
  trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1085, Moderate)

  * an information leak flaw was found in the kernel's USB implementation.
  Certain USB errors could result in an uninitialized kernel buffer being
  sent to user-space. An attacker with physical access to a target system
  could use this flaw to cause an information leak. (CVE-2010-1083, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ang Way Chuang for reporting CVE-2010-1086.

  Bug fixes:

  * a regression prevented the Broadcom BCM5761 network device from working
  when in the first (top) PCI-E slot of Hewlett-Packard (HP) Z600 systems.
  Note: The card worked in the 2nd or 3rd PCI-E slot. (BZ#567205)

  * the Xen hypervisor supports 168 GB of RAM for 32-bit guests. The physical
  address range was set incorrectly, however, causing 32-bit,
  para-virtualized Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 guests to crash when launched
  on AMD64 or Intel 64 hosts that have more than 64 GB of RAM. (BZ#574392)

  * RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a regression, causing diskdump to fail on
  systems with certain adapters using the qla2xxx driver. (BZ#577234)

  * a race condition caused TX to stop in a guest using the virtio_net
  driver. (BZ#580089)

  * on some systems, using the "arp_validate=3" bonding option caused both
  links to show as "down" even though the arp_target was responding to ARP
  requests sent by the bonding driver. (BZ#580842)

  * in some circumstances, when a Red Hat Enterprise Linux client connected
  to a re-booted Windows-based NFS server, server-side filehandle-to-inode
  mapping changes caused a kernel panic. "bad_inode_ops" handling was changed
  to prevent this. Note: filehandle-to-inode mapping changes may still cause
  errors, but not panics. (BZ#582908)

  * when installing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 guest via PXE, hard-coded
  fixed-size scatterlists could conflict with host requests, causing the
  guest's kernel to panic. With this update, dynamically allocated
  scatterlists are used, resolving this issue. (BZ#582911)

  Enhancements:

  * kernel support for connlimit. Note: iptables errata update RHBA-2010:0395
  is also required for connlimit to work correctly. (BZ#563223)

  * support for the Intel architectural performance monitoring subsystem
  (arch_perfmon). On supported CPUs, arch_perfmon offers means to mark
  performance events and options for configuring and counting these events.
  (BZ#582913)

  * kernel support for OProfile sampling of Intel microarchitecture (Nehalem)
  CPUs. This update alone does not address OProfile support for such CPUs. A
  future oprofile package update will allow OProfile to work on Intel Nehalem
  CPUs. (BZ#582241)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must
  be rebooted for this update to take effect.
