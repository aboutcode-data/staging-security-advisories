  - CVE-2011-2696
summary: |
  Updated libsndfile packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libsndfile packages provide a library for reading and writing sound
  files.

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way the libsndfile library processed certain Ensoniq PARIS
  Audio Format (PAF) audio files. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted PAF file that, when opened, could cause an application
  using libsndfile to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-2696)

  Users of libsndfile are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  using libsndfile must be restarted for the update to take effect.
