  - CVE-2005-2499
summary: "An updated slocate package that fixes a denial of service and various bugs\nis now\
  \ available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\n\
  Security Response Team.\n\nSlocate is a security-enhanced version of locate. Like locate,\
  \ slocate\nsearches through a central database (updated nightly) for files that match\na given\
  \ pattern. Slocate allows you to quickly find files anywhere on your\nsystem.\n\nA bug was\
  \ found in the way slocate scans the local filesystem. A carefully\nprepared directory structure\
  \ could cause updatedb's file system scan to\nfail silently, resulting in an incomplete slocate\
  \ database. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-2499\n\
  to this issue.\n\nAdditionally this update addresses the following issues:\n\n- Files with\
  \ a size of 2 GB and larger were not entered into the slocate\n  database.\n\n- File system\
  \ type exclusions were processed only when starting updatedb \n  and did not reflect file\
  \ systems mounted while updatedb was running \n  (for example, automounted file systems).\n\
  \n- File system type exclusions were ignored for file systems that were\n  mounted to a path\
  \ containing a symbolic link.\n\n- Databases created by slocate were owned by the slocate\
  \ group even if they\n  were created by regular users.\n\nUsers of slocate are advised to\
  \ upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches and is not affected\
  \ by these issues."
