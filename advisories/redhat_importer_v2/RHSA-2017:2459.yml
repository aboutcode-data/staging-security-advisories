  - CVE-2017-2885
summary: |
  An update for libsoup is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The libsoup packages provide an HTTP client and server library for GNOME.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered within the HTTP processing of libsoup. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a server using the libsoup HTTP server functionality or by tricking a user into connecting to a malicious HTTP server with an application using the libsoup HTTP client functionality. (CVE-2017-2885)

  Red Hat would like to thank Aleksandar Nikolic (Cisco Talos) for reporting this issue.
