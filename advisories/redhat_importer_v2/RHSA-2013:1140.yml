summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2013-1701)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox generated Certificate Request Message
  Format (CRMF) requests. An attacker could use this flaw to perform
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2013-1710)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the interaction between frames
  and browser history. An attacker could use this flaw to trick Firefox into
  treating malicious content as if it came from the browser history, allowing
  for XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1709)

  It was found that the same-origin policy could be bypassed due to the way
  Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) were checked in JavaScript. An attacker
  could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks, or install malicious add-ons
  from third-party pages. (CVE-2013-1713)

  It was found that web workers could bypass the same-origin policy. An
  attacker could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1714)

  It was found that, in certain circumstances, Firefox incorrectly handled
  Java applets. If a user launched an untrusted Java applet via Firefox, the
  applet could use this flaw to obtain read-only access to files on the
  user's local system. (CVE-2013-1717)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Jeff Gilbert, Henrik Skupin, moz_bug_r_a4, Cody
  Crews, Federico Lanusse, and Georgi Guninski as the original reporters of
  these issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 17.0.8 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 17.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
