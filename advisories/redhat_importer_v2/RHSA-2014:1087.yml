summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0, which fixes multiple security issues and
  several bugs, is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1,
  and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0
  Release Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the
  most significant of these changes.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in
  the mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page
  served by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module
  (MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd
  child process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user. (CVE-2014-0226)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module
  handled request body decompression (configured via the "DEFLATE" input
  filter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be
  decompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system
  memory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module
  executed CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.
  A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause
  the httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)

  It was found that several application-provided XML files, such as web.xml,
  content.xml, *.tld, *.tagx, and *.jspx, resolved external entities,
  permitting XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker able to deploy
  malicious applications to Tomcat could use this flaw to circumvent security
  restrictions set by the JSM, and gain access to sensitive information on
  the system. Note that this flaw only affected deployments in which Tomcat
  is running applications from untrusted sources, such as in a shared hosting
  environment. (CVE-2013-4590)

  It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a
  malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to
  process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library
  descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML
  parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities
  and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications
  deployed on the same Tomcat instance. (CVE-2014-0119)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
  are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0. The JBoss server
  process must be restarted for this update to take effect.
