summary: |
  An updated spice-xpi package that fixes two security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing
  virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
  hypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.

  The spice-xpi package provides a plug-in that allows the SPICE client to
  run from within Mozilla Firefox.

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the SPICE Firefox plug-in.
  If a user were tricked into visiting a malicious web page with Firefox
  while the SPICE plug-in was enabled, it could cause Firefox to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-1179)

  It was found that the SPICE Firefox plug-in used a predictable name for one
  of its log files. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct a
  symbolic link attack, allowing them to overwrite arbitrary files accessible
  to the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0012)

  Users of spice-xpi should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,
  Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
