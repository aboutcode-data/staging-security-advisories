summary: "Updated SANE packages that resolve a number of vulnerabilities with the\nsaned daemon\
  \ are now available.\n\nSANE is a package for using document scanners.\n\nSane includes a\
  \ daemon program (called saned) that enables a single machine\nconnected to a scanner to be\
  \ used remotely.  This program contains several\nvulnerabilities.\n\nNOTE: Although the SANE\
  \ packages include this program, it is not used by\ndefault under Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\
  \nThe IP address of the remote host is only checked after the first\ncommunication occurs,\
  \ causing saned.conf restrictions to be ineffective for\nthe first communication.  The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0773\
  \ to this issue.\n\nA connection that is dropped early causes one of several problems.  The\n\
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2003-0774,\
  \ CAN-2003-0775, and CAN-2003-0777 to these issues.\n\nLack of error checking can cause various\
  \ other unfavorable consequences. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has\nassigned the names CAN-2003-0776 and CAN-2003-0778 to these issues.\n\nUsers of SANE\
  \ (particularly those that use saned for remote scanner access)\nshould upgrade to these errata\
  \ packages, which contain a backported\nsecurity patch to resolve these issues."
