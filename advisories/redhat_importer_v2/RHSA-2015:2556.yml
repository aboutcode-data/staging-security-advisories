  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
  flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 is a micro product release that updates Red Hat
  JBoss Fuse 6.2.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
  the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
  section, for a list of changes.

  The following security fixes are addressed in this release:

  It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code
  execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed
  chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the
  commons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)

  Further information about this issue may be found at:
  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023

  A flaw was discovered that when an application uses Groovy (has it on the
  classpath) and uses the standard Java serialization mechanism, an attacker
  can bake a special serialized object that executes code directly when
  deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not
  isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this
  vulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)

  It was found that the JBoss A-MQ console would accept a string containing
  JavaScript as the name of a new message queue. Execution of the UI would
  subsequently execute the script. An attacker could use this flaw to access
  sensitive information or perform other attacks. (CVE-2015-5181)

  Red Hat would like to thank Naftali Rosenbaum of Comsec Consulting for
  reporting CVE-2015-5181.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 are advised to apply this update.
