summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.3.0, which fixes multiple security issues,
  various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on
  Infinispan.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.3.0 serves as a replacement for
  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.1. It includes various bug fixes and
  enhancements which are detailed in the Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.3.0
  Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Data_Grid/

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  It was discovered that JBoss Web did not limit the length of chunk sizes
  when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to perform a denial of service attack against JBoss Web by streaming an
  unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server
  resources. (CVE-2014-0075)

  It was found that JBoss Web did not check for overflowing values when
  parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a JBoss Web server
  located behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header
  correctly. (CVE-2014-0099)

  It was found that the security audit functionality, provided by Red Hat
  JBoss Data Grid, logged request parameters in plain text. This may have
  caused passwords to be included in the audit log files when using BASIC or
  FORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access to audit log files
  could possibly use this flaw to obtain application or server authentication
  credentials. Refer to the Solution section of this advisory for additional
  information on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2014-0058)

  It was found that the security auditing functionality provided by PicketBox
  and JBossSX, both security frameworks for Java applications, used a
  world-readable audit.log file to record sensitive information. A local user
  could possibly use this flaw to gain access to the sensitive information in
  the audit.log file. (CVE-2014-0059)

  It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet
  implementation in JBoss Web allowed the definition of XML External Entities
  (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this to
  circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive
  information. (CVE-2014-0096)

  It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a
  malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by JBoss Web to
  process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library
  descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML
  parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities
  and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications
  deployed on the same JBoss Web instance. (CVE-2014-0119)

  The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.3.0.
