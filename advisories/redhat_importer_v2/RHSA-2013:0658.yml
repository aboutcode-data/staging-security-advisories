summary: |
  Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix two security issues and add one
  enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-cinder packages provide OpenStack Volume (code name Cinder),
  which provides services to manage and access block storage volumes for use
  by virtual machine instances.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
  parser used by Cinder. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
  specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, causing Cinder to consume an
  excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

  A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Cinder. If a remote attacker
  sent a specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, it could cause Cinder to
  connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
  allow an attacker to read files on the Cinder server that are accessible
  to the user running Cinder. (CVE-2013-1665)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * This update implements a Cinder driver that allows Red Hat Storage to be
  used as a back-end for Cinder volumes. To use this driver,
  "volume_driver = cinder.volume.glusterfs.GlusterfsDriver" and the
  "glusterfs_shares_config" option must be set in "/etc/cinder/cinder.conf",
  and the RHSA-2013:0657 openstack-nova update must also be installed. Note
  that there is no volume snapshot or clone support when using this driver.
  (BZ#892686)

  All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which fix these issues and add this enhancement. After installing
  the updated packages, the Cinder running services will be restarted
  automatically.
