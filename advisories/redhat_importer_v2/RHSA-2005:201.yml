  - CVE-2005-0446
summary: "An updated squid package that fixes a denial of service issue is now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSquid is a full-featured Web proxy cache.  \n\
  \  \nA bug was found in the way Squid handles fully qualified domain name (FQDN)\nlookups.\
  \  A malicious DNS server could crash Squid by sending a carefully\ncrafted DNS response to\
  \ an FQDN lookup.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2005-0446 to\nthis issue.  \n \nThis erratum also includes two minor patches\
  \ to the LDAP helpers.  One \ncorrects a slight malformation in ldap search requests (although\
  \ all \nknown LDAP servers accept the requests).  The other adds documentation \nfor the -v\
  \ option to the ldap helpers. \n \nUsers of Squid should upgrade to this updated package,\
  \ which contains a  \nbackported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue."
