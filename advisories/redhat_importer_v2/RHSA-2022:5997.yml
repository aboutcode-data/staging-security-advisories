summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 5.2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a Ceph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.

  The ceph-ansible package provides Ansible playbooks for installing, maintaining, and upgrading Red Hat Ceph Storage.

  Perf Tools is a collection of performance analysis tools, including a high-performance multi-threaded malloc() implementation that works particularly well with threads and STL, a thread-friendly heap-checker, a heap profiler, and a cpu-profiler.

  The libunwind packages contain a C API to determine the call chain of a program. This API is necessary for compatibility with Google Performance Tools (gperftools).

  nfs-ganesha : NFS-GANESHA is a NFS Server running in user space. It comes with various back-end modules (called FSALs) provided as shared objects to support different file systems and name-spaces.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ceph (16.2.8), ceph-ansible (6.0.27.9), cephadm-ansible (1.8.0), gperftools (2.9.1), leveldb (1.23), libunwind (1.5.0), nfs-ganesha (3.5), oath-toolkit (2.6.7). (BZ#1623330, BZ#1942171, BZ#1977888, BZ#1997480, BZ#1997996, BZ#2006214, BZ#2006771, BZ#2013215, BZ#2018906, BZ#2024720, BZ#2028628, BZ#2029307, BZ#2030540, BZ#2039669, BZ#2041563, BZ#2041571, BZ#2042417, BZ#2042602, BZ#2043602, BZ#2047487, BZ#2048681, BZ#2049272, BZ#2053468, BZ#2053591, BZ#2055173, BZ#2057307, BZ#2060278, BZ#2064627, BZ#2077843, BZ#2080242)

  Security Fix(es):

  * ceph: user/tenant can obtain access (read/write) to any share (CVE-2022-0670)
