  - CVE-2014-1544
summary: |
  Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended
  Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, and
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications.

  A race condition was found in the way NSS verified certain certificates.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using NSS or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  that application. (CVE-2014-1544)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting
  CVE-2014-1544. Upstream acknowledges Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber
  as the original reporters.

  Users of NSS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. After installing this update, applications using NSS
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
