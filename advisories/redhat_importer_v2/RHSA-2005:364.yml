aliases:
  - CVE-2005-1061
summary: |
  An updated logwatch package that fixes a denial of service issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the
  Red Hat Security Response Team.

  LogWatch is a customizable log analysis system. LogWatch parses
  through your system's logs for a given period of time and creates a
  report analyzing areas that you specify, in as much detail as you
  require.

  A bug was found in the logwatch secure script.  If an attacker is able to
  inject an arbitrary string into the /var/log/secure file, it is possible to
  prevent logwatch from detecting malicious activity. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2005-1061 to this issue.

  All users of logwatch are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which contain backported fixes for this issue.
