  - CVE-2010-0302
summary: |
  Updated cups packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX operating systems.

  It was discovered that the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2009:1595 did not
  fully correct the use-after-free flaw in the way CUPS handled references in
  its file descriptors-handling interface. A remote attacker could send
  specially-crafted queries to the CUPS server, causing it to crash.
  (CVE-2010-0302)

  Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.
