summary: "Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues and several\nbugs are\
  \ now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe kernel-rt packages contain\
  \ the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThese updated packages address\
  \ the following security issues:\n\n* a memory leak exists in keyctl handling. A local, unprivileged\
  \ user could\nuse this flaw to deplete kernel memory, eventually leading to a denial of\n\
  service. (CVE-2009-0031, Important)\n\n* an off-by-one underflow flaw was found in the eCryptfs\
  \ subsystem. This\ncould potentially cause a denial of service when the readlink() function\n\
  returned an error. (CVE-2009-0269, Moderate)\n\n* a deficiency was found in the Remote BIOS\
  \ Update (RBU) driver for Dell\nsystems. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause\
  \ a denial of\nservice by reading zero bytes from the image_type or packet_size files in\n\
  \"/sys/devices/platform/dell_rbu/\". (CVE-2009-0322, Moderate)\n\n* an inverted logic flaw\
  \ was found in the SysKonnect FDDI PCI adapter\ndriver, allowing driver statistics to be reset\
  \ only when the CAP_NET_ADMIN\ncapability was absent (local, unprivileged users could reset\
  \ driver\nstatistics). (CVE-2009-0675, Moderate)\n\n* the sock_getsockopt() function in the\
  \ Linux kernel did not properly\ninitialize a data structure that can be directly returned\
  \ to user-space\nwhen the getsockopt() function is called with SO_BSDCOMPAT optname set.\n\
  This flaw could possibly lead to memory disclosure.\n(CVE-2009-0676, Moderate)\n\nThese updated\
  \ packages also address numerous bugs, including the following:\n\n* the select() and poll()\
  \ functions were converted to use high resolution\ntimers (hrtimer). Since the change, the\
  \ system call pselect7() started\npresenting an incorrect behavior when the specified timeout\
  \ was NULL.\nInstead of blocking until an event happened (infinite timeout) it was\ntreated\
  \ as a no timeout (zero seconds). This update fixes the problem.\n(BZ#487382) \n\n* NFS is\
  \ a network file system sharing technology commonly used on Linux\nsystems. A bug exists in\
  \ the Linux kernel implementation of NFS. When two\n(or more) clients have the same file open\
  \ as it is being written to, a\nfault condition can arise triggering a system crash. This\
  \ update resolves\nthis bug. (BZ#486645)\n\n* a bug affected IBM BladeCenter LS21 machines\
  \ with the High Precision\nEvent Timer (HPET) enabled in the BIOS. In these machines, the\
  \ HPET_T0_CFG\nregister booted with level-triggered interrupts (HPET_TN_LEVEL) enabled.\n\
  This resulted in a boot-time hang during the delay calibration. This kernel\nresolves the\
  \ issue by disabling HPET_TN_LEVEL when setting up periodic\nmode. (BZ#485428)\n\n* Time Stamp\
  \ Counter (TSC) is the preferred time source for MRG Realtime\nsystems, although some TSC\
  \ models do not comply with the requirements of a\nRealtime system. This kernel updates the\
  \ tests carried out during boot time\nto check the TSC. (BZ#480244)\n\n* under certain conditions\
  \ netlink_broadcast may call yield() on behalf of\na high priority kernel thread. This can\
  \ lead to a system deadlock. The\nissue has been resolved. (BZ#463207)\n\nOther changes included\
  \ with this update are noted in the Red Hat Enterprise\nMRG Release Notes, available at the\
  \ location noted in the References\nsection below.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should\
  \ install this update which addresses\nthese vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs. For this\
  \ update to take effect,\nthe system must be rebooted."
