  - CVE-2011-2192
summary: |
  Updated curl packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  cURL provides the libcurl library and a command line tool for downloading
  files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

  It was found that cURL always performed credential delegation when
  authenticating with GSSAPI. A rogue server could use this flaw to obtain
  the client's credentials and impersonate that client to other servers that
  are using GSSAPI. (CVE-2011-2192)

  Users of curl should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications using
  libcurl must be restarted for the update to take effect.
