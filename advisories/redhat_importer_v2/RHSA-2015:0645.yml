  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The Red Hat Support plug-in for Red Hat OpenStack is a Technology Preview
  feature which offers seamless integrated access to Red Hat subscription
  services from the Red Hat OpenStack administration portal. The plug-in
  provides automated functionality that enables quicker help, answers, and
  proactive services. It offers easy and instant access to Red Hat exclusive

  user input. An authenticated user could use this flaw to read an arbitrary
  file with the permissions of the web server. (CVE-2015-0271)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sara Perez Merino of SensePost for reporting
  this issue.
