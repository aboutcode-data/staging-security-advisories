  - CVE-2014-8105
summary: |
  Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue, two bugs, and add
  one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the 389 Directory
  Server stored information in the Changelog that is exposed via the
  'cn=changelog' LDAP sub-tree. An unauthenticated user could in certain
  cases use this flaw to read data from the Changelog, which could include
  sensitive information such as plain-text passwords. (CVE-2014-8105)

  This issue was discovered by Petr Špaček of the Red Hat Identity Management
  Engineering Team.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * In multi-master replication (MMR), deleting a single-valued attribute of
  a Directory Server (DS) entry was previously in some cases not correctly
  replicated. Consequently, the entry state in the replica systems did not
  reflect the intended changes. This bug has been fixed and the removal of a
  single-valued attribute is now properly replicated. (BZ#1179099)

  * Prior to this update, the Directory Server (DS) always checked the ACI
  syntax. As a consequence, removing an ACI failed with a syntax error.
  With this update, the ACI check is stopped when the ACI is going to be
  removed, and the removal thus works as expected. (BZ#1179100)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * The buffer size limit for the 389-ds-base application has been increased
  to 2MB in order to match the buffer size limit of Simple Authentication and
  Security Layer (SASL) and Basic Encoding Rules (BER). (BZ#1179595)

  All 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. After installing this update, the 389 server service will be
  restarted automatically.
