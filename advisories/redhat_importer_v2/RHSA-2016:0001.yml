summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-7201, CVE-2015-7205, CVE-2015-7212, CVE-2015-7213)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled content using the 'data:'
  and 'view-source:' URIs. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the
  same-origin policy and read data from cross-site URLs and local files.
  (CVE-2015-7214)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Andrei Vaida, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, Abhishek
  Arya, Ronald Crane, and Tsubasa Iinuma as the original reporters of these
  issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Thunderbird 38.5.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 38.5.0, which corrects these issues. After
  installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
  take effect.
