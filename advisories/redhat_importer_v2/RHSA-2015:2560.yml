  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code

  chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the
  commons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)

  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023

  It was found that batik was vulnerable to XML External Entity attacks when
  parsing SVG files. A remote attacker able to send malicious SVG content to
  the affected server could use this flaw to read files accessible to the
  user running the application server, and potentially perform other more
  advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0250)

  It was found that jsoup did not properly validate user-supplied HTML
  content; certain HTML snippets could get past the validator without being
  detected as unsafe. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted HTML
  snippet to execute arbitrary web script in the user's browser.
  (CVE-2015-6748)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.2.0.
