  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2016-1930, CVE-2016-1935)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.

  installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
  take effect.
