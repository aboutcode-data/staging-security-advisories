summary: "An update for imgbased, redhat-release-virtualization-host, and redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages\
  \ include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization\
  \ Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the\
  \ packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring\
  \ the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host,\
  \ ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using\
  \ a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual\
  \ machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and\
  \ performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization\
  \ Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor.\
  \ Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit\
  \ user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* glib: integer overflow in g_bytes_new function on 64-bit platforms\
  \ due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits (CVE-2021-27219)\n\n* kernel: userspace\
  \ applications can misuse the KVM API to cause a write of 16 bytes at an offset up to 32 GB\
  \ from vcpu->run (CVE-2021-3501)\n\n* polkit: local privilege escalation using polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync()\
  \ (CVE-2021-3560)\n\n* hw: vt-d related privilege escalation (CVE-2020-24489)\n\nFor more\
  \ details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related\
  \ information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\
  \n* Previously, systemtap dependencies were not included in the RHV-H channel. Therefore,\
  \ systemtap could not be installed.\nIn this release, the systemtap dependencies have been\
  \ included in the channel, resolving the issue. (BZ#1903997)"
