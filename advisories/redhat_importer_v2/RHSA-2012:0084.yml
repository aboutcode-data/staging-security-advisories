  - CVE-2012-0442
summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, e-mail and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  A flaw was found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2012-0442)

  The same-origin policy in SeaMonkey treated http://example.com and
  http://[example.com] as interchangeable. A malicious script could possibly
  use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information (such as a client's
  IP and user e-mail address, or httpOnly cookies) that may be included in
  HTTP proxy error replies, generated in response to invalid URLs using
  square brackets. (CVE-2011-3670)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
