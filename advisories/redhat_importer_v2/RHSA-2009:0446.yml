  - CVE-2008-5519
summary: |
  An updated mod_jk package that fixes a security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Application Stack v2.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  mod_jk is an Apache Tomcat connector that allows Apache Tomcat and the
  Apache HTTP Server to communicate with each other.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_jk. In certain situations,
  if a faulty client set the "Content-Length" header without providing data,
  or if a user sent repeated requests very quickly, one user may view a
  response intended for another user. (CVE-2008-5519)

  As well, the sample configuration files provided in the documentation have
  been updated to reflect recommended practice.

  All mod_jk users are advised to upgrade to this updated package. It
  provides mod_jk 1.2.28, which is not vulnerable to this issue.
