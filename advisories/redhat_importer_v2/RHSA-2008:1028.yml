  - CVE-2008-5286
summary: |
  Updated cups packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Common UNIX® Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX operating systems.

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap buffer overflow, was discovered
  in the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) decoding routines used by the CUPS
  image-converting filters, "imagetops" and "imagetoraster". An attacker
  could create a malicious PNG file that could, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code as the "lp" user if the file was printed. (CVE-2008-5286)

  CUPS users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
