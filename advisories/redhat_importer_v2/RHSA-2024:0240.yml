summary: "An update is now available for OpenJDK.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this\
  \ update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\
  \ base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability\
  \ from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nThe OpenJDK 17 packages provide the OpenJDK\
  \ 17 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 17 Java Software Development Kit.\n\nThis release\
  \ of the Red Hat build of OpenJDK 17 (17.0.10) for portable Linux serves as a replacement\
  \ for the Red Hat build of OpenJDK 17 (17.0.9) and includes security and bug fixes, and enhancements.\
  \ For further information, refer to the release notes linked to in the References section.\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* OpenJDK: array out-of-bounds access due to missing range check in\
  \ C1 compiler (8314468) (CVE-2024-20918)\n\n* OpenJDK: incorrect handling of ZIP files with\
  \ duplicate entries (8276123) (CVE-2024-20932)\n\n* OpenJDK: RSA padding issue and timing\
  \ side-channel attack against TLS (8317547) (CVE-2024-20952)\n\n* OpenJDK: JVM class file\
  \ verifier flaw allows unverified bytecode execution (8314295) (CVE-2024-20919)\n\n* OpenJDK:\
  \ range check loop optimization issue (8314307) (CVE-2024-20921)\n\n* OpenJDK: logging of\
  \ digital signature private keys (8316976) (CVE-2024-20945)\n\nFor more details about the\
  \ security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related\
  \ information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\n2024-01-22 ADDENDUM\n\
  \nThe Linux binaries currently available replace those released on the 17th of January 2024.\n\
  \nRed Hat builds OpenJDK on a number of systems with different buildroots requirements, and\
  \ typically releases the binaries built on RHEL 7 on the Customer Portal for maximum compatibility.\n\
  \nRed Hat discovered a problem during the latest release where we accidentally uploaded binaries\
  \ that were built using a buildroot derived from RHEL 8.8 for all versions of OpenJDK. This\
  \ caused some incompatibilities with older versions, because RHEL 8.8 has a newer glibc, among\
  \ other libraries.\n\nTo determine if you are running the incorrect version on a RHEL 7 system,\
  \ run 'java -version'. If the command fails immediately, you might need to update to this\
  \ release.\n\nThe following are the names of the distributions built incorrectly (please note\
  \ the absence of 'el' in the filename):\n\njava-17-openjdk-17.0.10.0.7-1.portable.jdk.x86_64.tar.xz\n\
  java-17-openjdk-17.0.10.0.7-1.portable.jre.x86_64.tar.xz \n\nThe following are the names of\
  \ the corrected distributions:\n\njava-17-openjdk-17.0.10.0.7-1.portable.jdk.el.x86_64.tar.xz\n\
  java-17-openjdk-17.0.10.0.7-1.portable.jre.el.x86_64.tar.xz \n\nPlease note, even if these\
  \ binaries are built on RHEL 7 for backward compatibility, not all versions of the Red Hat\
  \ build of OpenJDK are supported on RHEL 7. Please check the OpenJDK Life Cycle and Support\
  \ Policy page for more information:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/1299013"
