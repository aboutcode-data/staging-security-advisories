aliases:
  - CVE-2009-5030
  - CVE-2012-3358
summary: |
  Updated openjpeg packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenJPEG is an open source library for reading and writing image files in
  JPEG 2000 format.

  An input validation flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way OpenJPEG handled the tile number and size in an image tile
  header. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted image file
  that, when decoded using an application linked against OpenJPEG, would
  cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-3358)

  OpenJPEG allocated insufficient memory when encoding JPEG 2000 files from
  input images that have certain color depths. A remote attacker could
  provide a specially-crafted image file that, when opened in an application
  linked against OpenJPEG (such as image_to_j2k), would cause the application
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the application. (CVE-2009-5030)

  Users of OpenJPEG should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  patches to correct these issues. All running applications using OpenJPEG
  must be restarted for the update to take effect.
