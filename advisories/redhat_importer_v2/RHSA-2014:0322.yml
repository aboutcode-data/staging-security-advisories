  - CVE-2012-6151
  - CVE-2014-2285
summary: |
  Updated net-snmp packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The net-snmp packages provide various libraries and tools for the Simple
  Network Management Protocol (SNMP), including an SNMP library, an
  extensible agent, tools for requesting or setting information from SNMP
  agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP traps, a version of the
  netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl Management Information Base
  (MIB) browser.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way snmpd, the Net-SNMP daemon,
  handled subagent timeouts. A remote attacker able to trigger a subagent
  timeout could use this flaw to cause snmpd to loop infinitely or crash.
  (CVE-2012-6151)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the snmptrapd service, which
  receives and logs SNMP trap messages, handled SNMP trap requests with an
  empty community string when the Perl handler (provided by the net-snmp-perl
  package) was enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash
  snmptrapd by sending a trap request with an empty community string.
  (CVE-2014-2285)

  All net-snmp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the snmpd and snmptrapd services will be restarted automatically.
