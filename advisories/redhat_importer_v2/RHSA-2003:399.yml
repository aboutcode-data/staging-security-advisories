  - CVE-2003-0962
summary: |
  Updated rsync packages are now available that fix a heap overflow in the
  Rsync server.

  rsync is a program for sychronizing files over the network.

  A heap overflow bug exists in rsync versions prior to 2.5.7.  On machines
  where the rsync server has been enabled, a remote attacker could use this
  flaw to execute arbitrary code as an unprivileged user.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0962 to this issue.

  All users should upgrade to these erratum packages containing version
  2.5.7 of rsync, which is not vulnerable to this issue.

  NOTE: The rsync server is disabled (off) by default in Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.  To check if the rsync server has been enabled (on), run the
  following command:

  /sbin/chkconfig --list rsync

  If the rsync server has been enabled but is not required, it can be
  disabled by running the following command as root:

  /sbin/chkconfig rsync off

  Red Hat would like to thank the rsync team for their rapid response and
  quick fix for this issue.
