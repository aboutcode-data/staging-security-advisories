summary: "Updated libpng packages that fix a out of bounds memory access are now\navailable.\n\
  \nThe libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable\
  \ Network Graphics) image format files.  \n\nSteve Grubb discovered a out of bounds memory\
  \ access flaw in libpng.  An\nattacker could carefully craft a PNG file in such a way that\
  \ it would cause\nan application linked to libpng to crash when opened by a victim.  This\n\
  issue may not be used to execute arbitrary code.  \n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages that contain a\nbackported security fix not vulnerable to this issue."
