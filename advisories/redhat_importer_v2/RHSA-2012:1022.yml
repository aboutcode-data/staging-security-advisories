  - CVE-2011-4605
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Application Server is the base package for JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform, providing the core server components. The Java Naming
  and Directory Interface (JNDI) Java API allows Java software clients to
  locate objects or services in an application server.

  It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote
  write access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to
  access the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,
  delete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,
  application-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting this
  issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
