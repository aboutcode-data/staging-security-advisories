  - CVE-2006-6235
summary: |
  Updated GnuPG packages that fix two security issues are now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.

  Tavis Ormandy discovered a stack overwrite flaw in the way GnuPG decrypts
  messages. An attacker could create carefully crafted message that could cause
  GnuPG to execute arbitrary code if a victim attempts to decrypt the message.
  (CVE-2006-6235)

  A heap based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way GnuPG constructs
  messages to be written to the terminal during an interactive session. An
  attacker could create a carefully crafted message which with user interaction
  could cause GnuPG to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
  user running GnuPG. (CVE-2006-6169)

  All users of GnuPG are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct these issues.
