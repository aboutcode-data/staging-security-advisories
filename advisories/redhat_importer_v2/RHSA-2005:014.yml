aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0946
  - CVE-2004-1014
summary: |
  An updated nfs-utils package that fixes various security issues is now
  available.

  The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
  related tools.

  SGI reported that the statd daemon did not properly handle the SIGPIPE
  signal.  A misconfigured or malicious peer could cause statd to crash,
  leading to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1014 to this issue.

  Arjan van de Ven discovered a buffer overflow in rquotad.  On 64-bit
  architectures, an improper integer conversion can lead to a buffer
  overflow.  An attacker with access to an NFS share could send a specially
  crafted request which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0946 to this issue.

  All users of nfs-utils should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues.
