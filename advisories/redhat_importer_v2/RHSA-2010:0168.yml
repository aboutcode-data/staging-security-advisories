  - CVE-2010-0434
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues and add an enhancement
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

  It was discovered that mod_proxy_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
  Server Error" response when processing certain malformed requests, which
  caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations where
  mod_proxy is used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could cause
  mod_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ Protocol)
  servers for the retry timeout period (60 seconds by default) by sending
  specially-crafted requests. (CVE-2010-0408)

  A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the way the Apache HTTP Server
  handled request headers in subrequests. In configurations where subrequests
  are used, a multithreaded MPM (Multi-Processing Module) could possibly leak
  information from other requests in request replies. (CVE-2010-0434)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * with the updated openssl packages from RHSA-2010:0162 installed, mod_ssl
  will refuse to renegotiate a TLS/SSL connection with an unpatched client
  that does not support RFC 5746. This update adds the
  "SSLInsecureRenegotiation" configuration directive. If this directive is
  enabled, mod_ssl will renegotiate insecurely with unpatched clients.
  (BZ#567980)

  Refer to the following Red Hat Knowledgebase article for more details about
  the changed mod_ssl behavior: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491

  All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues and add this enhancement. After
  installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
