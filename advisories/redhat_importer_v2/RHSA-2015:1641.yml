summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 that fixes two security issues
  is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_cluster manager processed certain MCMP
  messages. An attacker with access to the network from which MCMP messages
  are allowed to be sent could use this flaw to execute arbitrary JavaScript
  code in the mod_cluster manager web interface. (CVE-2015-0298)

  It was discovered that a JkUnmount rule for a subtree of a previous JkMount
  rule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker to potentially
  access a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be accessible
  to them. (CVE-2014-8111)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web
  Server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
