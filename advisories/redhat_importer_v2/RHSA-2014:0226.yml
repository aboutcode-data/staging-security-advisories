summary: |
  This is the one-year notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS). This notice applies only to
  those customers subscribed to the Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) channel
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in the Customer Portal.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 will be
  retired on February 28, 2015, and support will no longer be provided.
  Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including
  critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 ELS after February 28, 2015. In addition, technical
  support through Red Hat's Global Support Services will no longer be
  provided after this date.

  The retirement process for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ELS will complete on
  February 28, 2015. On that date, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ELS
  channels will be moved to the "Retired" channels area (under the "Retired"
  tab) on the Customer Portal, and customers will be unsubscribed from the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support channels.

  Customers continuing to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ELS on a system will
  consume a subscription. Customers wishing to access Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 ELS content on the Customer Portal will need an active RHEL Server
  subscription. Customers who choose to resubscribe a system to the retired
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 ELS channels will consume a RHEL Server
  subscription. Note again that the products in the Retired channels are
  frozen, and no further security patches or bug fixes will be provided.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a benefit
  of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux release.
