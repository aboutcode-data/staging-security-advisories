summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and three bugs are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has\
  \ rated this update as having Important security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System\
  \ (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\
  \ from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux\
  \ kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's\
  \ implementation of vectored pipe read\nand write functionality did not take into account\
  \ the I/O vectors that were\nalready processed when retrying after a failed atomic access\
  \ operation,\npotentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array\noverrun.\
  \ A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system\nor, potentially, escalate\
  \ their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,\nImportant)\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw\
  \ was found in the way the Linux kernel's Intel\nAES-NI instructions optimized version of\
  \ the RFC4106 GCM mode decryption\nfunctionality handled fragmented packets. A remote attacker\
  \ could use this\nflaw to crash, or potentially escalate their privileges on, a system over\
  \ a\nconnection with an active AES-GCM mode IPSec security association.\n(CVE-2015-3331, Important)\n\
  \nThe security impact of the CVE-2015-1805 issue was discovered by Red Hat.\n\nThis update\
  \ also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Parallel extending direct I/O writes to a file could\
  \ previously race to update the size of the file. If executed in an incorrect order, the file\
  \ size could move backwards and push a previously completed write beyond the end of the file,\
  \ which resulted in losing the write. With this update, file size updates always execute in\
  \ appropriate order, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1218498) \n\n* When the load rose and run queues\
  \ were busy due to the effects of the enqueue_entity() function, tasks with large sched_entity.vruntime\
  \ values could previously be prevented from using the CPU time. A patch eliminating the entity_key()\
  \ function in the sched_fair.c latency value has been backported from upstream, and all tasks\
  \ are now provided with fair CPU runtime. (BZ#1219121) \n\n* Previously, running the clock_gettime()\
  \ function quickly in a loop could result in a jump back in time. Consequently, programs could\
  \ behave unexpectedly when they assumed that clock_getime() returned an equal or greater time\
  \ in subsequent calls. With this update, if the time delta between calls is negative, the\
  \ clock is no longer updated. As a result, a subsequent call to clock_gettime() is guaranteed\
  \ to return a time greater than or equal to a previous call. (BZ#1219500)\n\nAll kernel users\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct\
  \ these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect."
