summary: |
  Updated packages for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0
  that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java
  applications, which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss
  Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

  It was found that the org.jboss.seam.web.AuthenticationFilter class
  implementation did not properly use Seam logging. A remote attacker could
  send specially crafted authentication headers to an application, which
  could result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
  running that application. (CVE-2014-0248)

  The CVE-2014-0248 issue was discovered by Marek Schmidt of Red Hat.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
