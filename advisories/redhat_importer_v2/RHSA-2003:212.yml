summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix a number of vulnerabilites are now available.

  The glibc package contains standard libraries that are used by
  multiple programs.

  An integer overflow is present in the xdrmem_getbytes() function of glibc
  2.3.1 and earlier.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability
  could cause buffer overflows and may be exploitable, leading to arbitrary
  code execution.

  Red Hat would like to thank eEye Digital Security for alerting us to this
  issue.

  An error in the calculation of memory needed for unpacking arrays in the
  XDR decoder in glibc 2.2.5 and earlier can result in a heap buffer
  overflow. Depending upon the application, this vulnerability may be
  exploitable and lead to arbitrary code execution.

  A read buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the glibc resolver code in
  versions of glibc up to and including 2.2.5. The vulnerability is triggered
  by DNS packets larger than 1024 bytes and can cause applications to crash.

  A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the way the glibc
  resolver handles the resolution of network names and addresses via DNS (as
  per Internet RFC 1011). Version 2.2.5 of glibc and earlier versions are
  affected. A system would be vulnerable to this issue if the "networks"
  database in /etc/nsswitch.conf includes the "dns" entry. By default, Red
  Hat Linux ships with "networks" set to "files" and is therefore not
  vulnerable to this issue. (CAN-2002-0684)

  All users should upgrade to these errata packages, which contain patches to
  the glibc libraries and are therefore not vulnerable to these issues.

  NOTE: Once the glibc upgrade has been completed, you must either reboot the
  system or restart all programs on the system (for example, by using telinit
  1 and then switching back to the original runlevel). Rebooting the system
  or restarting the system programs is necessary to avoid vulnerable glibc
  copies in memory.  In addition, one cannot mix old NSS modules or libresolv
  with upgraded NSS modules or libresolve in one running application.

  Note also that, if sshd is running so that the other services can be
  restarted remotely or for a remote reboot during an unattended glibc
  upgrade, glibc will also restart sshd.
