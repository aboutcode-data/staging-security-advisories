summary: "A new squirrelmail package that fixes security issues is now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package\
  \ written in PHP4. \n\nSeveral HTML filtering bugs were discovered in SquirrelMail.  An attacker\n\
  could inject arbitrary JavaScript leading to cross-site scripting attacks\nby sending an e-mail\
  \ viewed by a user within SquirrelMail. \n(CVE-2007-1262)\n\nSquirrelmail did not sufficiently\
  \ check arguments to IMG tags in HTML\ne-mail messages. This could be exploited by an attacker\
  \ by sending\narbitrary e-mail messages on behalf of a squirrelmail user tricked into opening\n\
  a maliciously crafted HTML e-mail message.  (CVE-2007-2589)\n\nUsers of SquirrelMail should\
  \ upgrade to this erratum package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct these issues."
