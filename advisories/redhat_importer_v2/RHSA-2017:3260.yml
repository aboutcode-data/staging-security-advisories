summary: |
  An update for samba is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the related Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allow PC-compatible machines to share files, printers, and various information.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way samba servers handled certain SMB1 requests. An unauthenticated attacker could send specially-crafted SMB1 requests to cause the server to crash or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14746)

  * A memory disclosure flaw was found in samba. An attacker could retrieve parts of server memory, which could contain potentially sensitive data, by sending specially-crafted requests to the samba server. (CVE-2017-15275)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Yihan Lian and Zhibin Hu (Qihoo 360 GearTeam) as the original reporter of CVE-2017-14746; and Volker Lendecke (SerNet and the Samba Team) as the original reporter of CVE-2017-15275.
