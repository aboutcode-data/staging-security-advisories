summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes several security issues and
  various bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time updates when the buffer
  the guest registered by writing to the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME machine state
  register (MSR) crossed a page boundary. A privileged guest user could use
  this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges,
  allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the host kernel level.
  (CVE-2013-1796)

  A potential use-after-free flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time
  updates when the GPA (guest physical address) the guest registered by
  writing to the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME machine state register (MSR) fell into a
  movable or removable memory region of the hosting user-space process (by
  default, QEMU-KVM) on the host. If that memory region is deregistered from
  KVM using KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION and the allocated virtual memory
  reused, a privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to escalate
  their privileges on the host. (CVE-2013-1797)

  A flaw was found in the way KVM emulated IOAPIC (I/O Advanced Programmable
  Interrupt Controller). A missing validation check in the
  ioapic_read_indirect() function could allow a privileged guest user to
  crash the host, or read a substantial portion of host kernel memory.
  (CVE-2013-1798)

  An integer overflow flaw was discovered in one of pixman's manipulation
  routines. If a remote attacker could trick an application using pixman into
  performing a certain manipulation, it could cause the application to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2013-1591)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting
  CVE-2013-1796, CVE-2013-1797, and CVE-2013-1798.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2013-2266 (a bind issue)

  CVE-2012-5195, CVE-2012-5526, CVE-2012-6329, and CVE-2013-1667 (perl
  issues)

  This update contains the fixes from the following errata:

  ovirt-node: RHBA-2013:0745
  libvirt: RHBA-2013:0725
  vdsm: RHBA-2013:0704
  kernel: RHSA-2013:0744

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
