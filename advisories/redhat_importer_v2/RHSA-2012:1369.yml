  - CVE-2012-2679
summary: |
  Updated rhncfg packages that fix one security issue, two bugs, and add one
  enhancement are now available for Red Hat Network Tools for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 Long Life; and Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6, 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Network Tools provide programs and libraries that allow your system
  to use provisioning, monitoring, and configuration management capabilities
  provided by Red Hat Network and Red Hat Network Satellite.

  It was discovered that the Red Hat Network (RHN) Configuration Client
  (rhncfg-client) tool set world-readable permissions on the
  "/var/log/rhncfg-actions" file, used to store the output of different
  rhncfg-client actions (such as diffing and verifying files). This could
  possibly allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information they would
  otherwise not have access to. (CVE-2012-2679)

  Note: With this update, rhncfg-client cannot create diffs of files that
  are not already world-readable, and "/var/log/rhncfg-actions" can only be
  read and written to by the root user.

  This issue was discovered by Paul Wouters of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When the user attempted to use the "rhncfg-client get" command to
  download a backup of deployed configuration files and these configuration
  files contained a broken symbolic link, the command failed with an error.
  This update ensures that "rhncfg-client get" no longer fails in this
  scenario. (BZ#836445)

  * The SYNOPSIS section of the rhn-actions-control(8) manual page has been
  updated to include the "--report" command line option as expected.
  (BZ#820517)

  As well, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * The rhncfg-manager utility now supports a new command line option,
  "--selinux-context". This option can be used to upload files and
  directories without setting the Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) context.
  (BZ#770575)

  All users of Red Hat Network Tools are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement.
