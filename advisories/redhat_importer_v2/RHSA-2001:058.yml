summary: "Updated mount packages fixing a potential security problem are available.\n\nIf any\
  \ swap files were created during installation of Red Hat Linux 7.1 \n(they were created during\
  \ updates if the user requested it), they were \nworld-readable, meaning every user could\
  \ read data in the swap file(s), \npossibly including passwords.\n\nThe affected swap files\
  \ are called /mountpoint/SWAP and \n/mountpoint/SWAP-(numeral)\n\nAlso, this release of mount\
  \ enforces sane permissions on swap space."
