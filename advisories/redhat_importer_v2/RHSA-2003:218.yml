summary: "Updated unzip and tar packages are available for IBM iSeries and pSeries\nsystems.\
  \  These packages resolve vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary files\nto be overwritten during\
  \ archive extraction.\n\nThe unzip and tar utilities are used for manipulating archives, which\
  \ are\nmultiple files stored inside of a single file.\n\nA directory traversal vulnerability\
  \ in unzip version 5.42 and earlier, as\nwell as GNU tar 1.13.19 and earlier, allows attackers\
  \ to overwrite\narbitrary files during archive extraction via a \"..\" (dot dot) in an\nextracted\
  \ filename. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2001-1267 and CAN-2001-1268 to\nthis issue. \n\nIn addition, unzip version\
  \ 5.42 and earlier also allows attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction\
  \ via filenames in the\narchive that begin with the \"/\" (slash) character. The Common\n\
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2001-1269\
  \ to this issue.\n\nDuring testing of the fix to GNU tar, it was discovered that GNU tar\n\
  1.13.25 was still vulnerable to a modified version of the same problem. Red\nHat has provided\
  \ a patch to tar 1.13.25 to correct this problem. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0399 to this issue.\n\nGNU tar 1.13.19\
  \ and other versions before 1.13.25  allow remote attackers\nto overwrite arbitrary files\
  \ via a symlink attack, as the result of a\nmodification that effectively disabled the security\
  \ check.  This issue\naffects only Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1216 to\nthis issue.\n\
  \nA vulnerabilitiy in unzip version 5.50 and earlier allows attackers to\noverwrite arbitrary\
  \ files during archive extraction by placing invalid\n(non-printable) characters between two\
  \ \".\" characters. These non-printable\ncharacters are filtered, resulting in a \"..\" sequence.\
  \ The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\n\
  CAN-2003-0282 to this issue.\n\nThis erratum also includes a patch ensuring that non-printable\
  \ characters\ndo not make it possible for a malicious .zip file to write to parent\ndirectories\
  \ unless the \"-:\" command line parameter is specified.\n\nUsers of unzip and tar are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich contain patched versions of unzip and GNU tar\
  \ that are not vulnerable\nto these issues."
