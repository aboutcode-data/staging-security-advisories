summary: |
  This is the One-Year notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5. This notification applies only to those customers subscribed to
  the channel for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  [Updated 19 April 2016]
  This advisory has been updated with a corrected list of architectures
  supported with the RHEL 5 Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will be retired on March 31, 2017,
  at the end of Production Phase 3. Until that date, customers will continue
  to receive Critical impact security patches and selected urgent priority
  bug fixes for RHEL 5.11 (the final RHEL 5 release). On that date, active
  support included with your RHEL Premium or Standard subscription will
  conclude. This means that customers will continue to have access to all
  previously released (RHEL 4, RHEL 5, etc.) content. In addition, limited
  technical support will be available through Red Hat's Global Support
  Services as described in the Knowledge Base article available at
  https://access.redhat.com/articles/64664 (search for "non-current minor
  release").

  However, we recognize that some customers will wish to remain on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 even after the March 31, 2017 retirement date. To meet
  this customer requirement, Red Hat will offer customers the option to
  purchase the Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On as an annually
  renewable subscription. This ELS Add-On provides customers with up to an
  additional three and a half (3.5) years of Critical impact security fixes
  and selected urgent priority bug fixes for RHEL 5.11. RHEL 5 ELS coverage
  will conclude on November 30, 2020.

  Note that the RHEL 5 ELS Add-On is available for the x86 (32- and 64-bit)
  architecture only. The RHEL 5 ELS Add-On is not available for the Itanium
  architecture.

  To take advantage of a more comprehensive product support, we encourage
  customers to migrate from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to a more recent
  version. As a benefit of the Red Hat subscription, customers may use their
  active subscriptions to entitle any system on any currently supported Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux release.
