  - CVE-2008-0884
summary: |
  Updated lspp-eal4-config-ibm and capp-lspp-eal4-config-hp packages that
  fix a security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The lspp-eal4-config-ibm and capp-lspp-eal4-config-hp packages contain
  utilities and documentation for configuring a machine for the Controlled
  Access Protection Profile, or the Labeled Security Protection Profile.

  It was discovered that use of the "capp-lspp-config" script results in the
  "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" file being set to world-writable. Authorized local
  users who have limited privileges could then exploit this to gain
  additional access, or to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2008-0884)

  This issue only affects users who have installed either of these packages
  from the Red Hat FTP site as their base system configuration kickstart
  script.

  New deployments using the lspp-eal4-config-ibm or capp-lspp-eal4-config-hp
  packages are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  this issue.

  For systems already deployed, the following command can be run as root to
  restore the permissions to a secure setting:

  chmod 0644 /etc/pam.d/system-auth
