summary: "Updated glibc packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and\nadd various\
  \ enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response\
  \ Team has rated this update as having moderate\nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\
  \ vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.\n\nThe glibc packages provide\
  \ the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread\nlibraries (libpthread), standard math libraries\
  \ (libm), and the Name Server\nCaching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.\
  \ Without\nthese libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.\n\nMultiple integer\
  \ overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,\nwere found in glibc's memory allocator\
  \ functions (pvalloc, valloc, and\nmemalign). If an application used such a function, it could\
  \ cause the\napplication to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges\
  \ of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-4332)\n\nA flaw was found in the regular\
  \ expression matching routines that process\nmultibyte character input. If an application\
  \ utilized the glibc regular\nexpression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted\n\
  input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.\n(CVE-2013-0242)\n\nIt was\
  \ found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory\nused during name resolution.\
  \ An attacker able to make an application\nresolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address\
  \ could possibly cause\nthe application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)\n\
  \nAmong other changes, this update includes an important fix for the following bug:\n\n* Due\
  \ to a defect in the initial release of the getaddrinfo() system call in Red Hat enterprise\
  \ Linux 6.0, AF_INET and AF_INET6 queries resolved from the /etc/hosts file returned queried\
  \ names as canonical names. This incorrect behavior is, however, still considered to be the\
  \ expected behavior. As a result of a recent change in getaddrinfo(), AF_INET6 queries started\
  \ resolving the canonical names correctly. However, this behavior was unexpected by applications\
  \ that relied on queries resolved from the /etc/hosts file, and these applications could thus\
  \ fail to operate properly. This update applies a fix ensuring that AF_INET6 queries resolved\
  \ from /etc/hosts always return the queried name as canonical. Note that DNS lookups are resolved\
  \ properly and always return the correct canonical names. A proper fix to AF_INET6 queries\
  \ resolution from /etc/hosts may be applied in future releases; for now, due to a lack of\
  \ standard, Red Hat suggests the first entry in the /etc/hosts file, that applies for the\
  \ IP address being resolved, to be considered the canonical entry. (BZ#1022022)\n\nThese updated\
  \ glibc packages also include additional bug fixes and \nvarious enhancements. Space precludes\
  \ documenting all of these changes \nin this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 6.5 \nTechnical Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the \nmost\
  \ significant of these changes.\n\nAll glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements."
