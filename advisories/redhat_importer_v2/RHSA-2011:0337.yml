  - CVE-2011-0762
summary: |
  An updated vsftpd package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  vsftpd (Very Secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) daemon) is a secure FTP
  server for Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems.

  A flaw was discovered in the way vsftpd processed file name patterns. An
  FTP user could use this flaw to cause the vsftpd process to use an
  excessive amount of CPU time, when processing a request with a
  specially-crafted file name pattern. (CVE-2011-0762)

  All vsftpd users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue. The vsftpd daemon must be restarted
  for this update to take effect.
