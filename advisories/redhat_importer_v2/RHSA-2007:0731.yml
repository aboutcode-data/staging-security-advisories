  - CVE-2007-3387
summary: "Updated tetex packages that fix a security issue in PDF handling are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nTeTeX is an implementation of\
  \ TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of\nformatting commands as input and creates a typesetter-independent\
  \ .dvi\n(DeVice Independent) file as output.\n\nMaurycy Prodeus discovered an integer overflow\
  \ flaw in the processing\nof PDF files.  An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that\
  \ would\ncause TeTeX to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code when opened. \n(CVE-2007-3387)\n\
  \nAll users of TeTeX should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported\
  \ patch to resolve this issue."
