  - CVE-2005-2641
summary: "Updated openldap and nss_ldap packages that correct a potential password \ndisclosure\
  \ issue and possible authentication vulnerability are now available. \n \nThis update has\
  \ been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red \nHat Security Response Team.\n\
  \nOpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access\nProtocol) applications\
  \ and development tools.\n\nThe nss_ldap module is an extension for use with GNU libc which\
  \ allows\napplications to, without internal modification, consult a directory service\nusing\
  \ LDAP to supplement information that would be read from local files\nsuch as /etc/passwd,\
  \ /etc/group, and /etc/shadow.\n\nA bug was found in the way OpenLDAP, nss_ldap, and pam_ldap\
  \ refer LDAP\nservers. If a client connection is referred to a different server, it is\npossible\
  \ that the referred connection will not be encrypted even if the\nclient has \"ssl start_tls\"\
  \ in its ldap.conf file. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the\
  \ name CAN-2005-2069\nto this issue.\n\nA bug was found in the way the pam_ldap module processed\
  \ certain failure\nmessages. If the server includes supplemental data in an authentication\n\
  failure result message, but the data does not include any specific error\ncode, the pam_ldap\
  \ module would proceed as if the authentication request\nhad succeeded, and authentication\
  \ would succeed. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-2641\
  \ to this issue. \n\nAdditionally the following issues are corrected in this erratum.\n\n\
  - The OpenLDAP upgrading documentation has been updated.\n\n- Fix a database deadlock locking\
  \ issue.\n\n- A fix where slaptest segfaults on exit after successful check.\n\n- The library\
  \ libslapd_db-4.2.so is now located in an\n  architecture-dependent directory.\n\n- The LDAP\
  \ client no longer enters an infinite loop when the server returns\n  a reference to itself.\n\
  \n- The pam_ldap module adds the ability to check user passwords using a\n  directory server\
  \ to PAM-aware applications.\n\n- The directory server can now include supplemental information\
  \ regarding\n  the state of the user's account if a client indicates that it supports\n  such\
  \ a feature.\n\nAll users of OpenLDAP and nss_ldap are advised to upgrade to these updated\n\
  packages, which contain backported fixes that resolve these issues."
