  - CVE-2019-14835
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host. (CVE-2019-14835)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * fragmented packets timing out (BZ#1741131)

  * Backport TCP follow-up for small buffers (BZ#1741143)
