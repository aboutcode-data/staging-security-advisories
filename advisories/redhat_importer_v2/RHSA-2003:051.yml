summary: |
  Updated Kerberos packages fix a number of vulnerabilities found in MIT
  Kerberos.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system. The MIT Kerberos team
  released an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the
  kerberos packages shipped by Red Hat. These vulnerabilities include:

  An integer signedness error in the ASN.1 decoder before version 1.2.5
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large
  unsigned data element length, which is later used as a negative value. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
  CAN-2002-0036 to this issue. Red Hat Linux 8.0 and later are not affected
  by this issue.

  The Key Distribution Center (KDC) before version 1.2.5 allows remote,
  authenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within
  the same realm using a certain protocol request that causes a null
  dereference (CAN-2003-0058). Red Hat Linux 8.0 and later are not affected
  by this issue.

  The Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers to
  cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a
  certain protocol request that causes an out-of-bounds read of an array
  (CAN-2003-0072).

  The Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers
  to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a
  certain protocol request that causes the KDC to corrupt its heap
  (CAN-2003-0082).

  A vulnerability in Kerberos before version 1.2.3 allows users from one
  realm to impersonate users in other realms that have the same inter-realm
  keys (CAN-2003-0059). Red Hat Linux 7.3 and later are not affected by this
  issue.

  The MIT advisory for these issues also mentions format string
  vulnerabilities in the logging routines (CAN-2003-0060). Previous versions
  of the kerberos packages from Red Hat already contain fixes for this issue.

  Vulnerabilities have been found in the support for triple-DES keys in the
  implementation of the Kerberos IV authentication protocol which is included
  in MIT Kerberos (CAN-2003-0139).

  Vulnerabilities have been found in the Kerberos IV authentication protocol
  which allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm key, which is
  shared with another realm, to impersonate any principal in that realm to
  any service in that realm. This vulnerability can only be closed by
  disabling cross-realm authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).

  Vulnerabilities have been found in the RPC library used by the kadmin
  service in Kerberos 5. A faulty length check in the RPC library exposes
  kadmind to an integer overflow which can be used to crash kadmind
  (CAN-2003-0028).

  All users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,
  which disable cross-realm authentication by default for Kerberos IV and
  which contain backported patches that correct these issues.
