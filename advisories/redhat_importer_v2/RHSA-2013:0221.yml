  various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1 serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.0, and includes bug
  fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes. The
  Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  This erratum provides the standalone counterpart to RHSA-2012:1573.

  Security fixes:

  An attack technique against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when block
  ciphers were used in CBC mode could allow a remote attacker to conduct
  chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading to the recovery of the entire plain text
  of a particular cryptogram. (CVE-2011-1096)

  JBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric
  keys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire
  plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)

  Spring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)
  expressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in
  the context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information
  from the server. Manual action is required to apply this fix. Refer to the
  Solution section. (CVE-2011-2730)

  When an application used FORM authentication, along with another component
  that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to
  FormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was
  possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator
  by appending "/j_security_check" to the end of a URL. (CVE-2012-3546)

  An XSS flaw allowed a remote attacker to perform an XSS attack against
  victims using the JMX Console. (CVE-2011-4575)

  SecurityAssociation.getCredential() returned the previous credential if no
  security context was provided. Depending on the deployed applications, this
  could possibly allow a remote attacker to hijack the credentials of a
  previously-authenticated user. (CVE-2012-3370)

  Configuring the JMX Invoker to restrict access to users with specific roles
  did not actually restrict access, allowing remote attackers with valid JMX
  Invoker credentials to perform JMX operations accessible to roles they are
  not a member of. (CVE-2012-5478)

  twiddle.sh accepted credentials as command line arguments, allowing local
  users to view them via a process listing. (CVE-2009-5066)

  It was found that NonManagedConnectionFactory would log the username and
  password in plain text when an exception was thrown. This could lead to the
  exposure of authentication credentials if local users had permissions to
  read the log file. (CVE-2012-0034)

  The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow
  unauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security
  interceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation
  of this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently
  disabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context
  of the user running the JBoss server. (CVE-2012-0874)

  CallerIdentityLoginModule retained the password from the previous call if a
  null password was provided. In non-default configurations this could
  possibly lead to a remote attacker hijacking a previously-authenticated
  user's session. (CVE-2012-3369)

  Red Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for
  reporting CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487, and Tyler Krpata for reporting
  CVE-2011-4575. CVE-2012-3370 and CVE-2012-3369 were discovered by Carlo de
  Wolf of Red Hat; CVE-2012-5478 discovered by Derek Horton of Red Hat; and
  CVE-2012-0874 was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response
  Team.
