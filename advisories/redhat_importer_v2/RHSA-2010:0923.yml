  - CVE-2010-3611
summary: |
  Updated dhcp packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address. DHCPv6 is the DHCP protocol version for IPv6 networks.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the way the dhcpd daemon
  parsed DHCPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash dhcpd
  via a specially-crafted DHCPv6 packet, if dhcpd was running as a DHCPv6
  server. (CVE-2010-3611)

  Users running dhcpd as a DHCPv6 server should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After
  installing this update, all DHCP servers will be restarted automatically.
