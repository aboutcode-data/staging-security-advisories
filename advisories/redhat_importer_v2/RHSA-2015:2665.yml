  Updated chromium-browser packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give

  Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

  Two flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash, execute
  arbitrary code, or disclose sensitive information when visited by the
  victim. (CVE-2015-6792)

  All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain Chromium version 47.0.2526.106, which corrects these issues.
  After installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes
  to take effect.
