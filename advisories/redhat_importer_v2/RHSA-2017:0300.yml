  - CVE-2017-2592
summary: |
  An update for python-oslo-middleware is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The OpenStack Oslo Middleware library provides components that can be injected into WSGI pipelines to intercept request and response flows. The base class can be enhanced with functionality like adding or updating HTTP headers, or to offer support for limiting size or connections.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An information-disclosure flaw was found in oslo.middleware. Software using the CatchError class could include sensitive values in a traceback's error message. Remote users could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from OpenStack component error logs (for example, keystone tokens). (CVE-2017-2592)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Divya K Konoor (IBM) as the original reporter.
