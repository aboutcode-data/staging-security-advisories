  - CVE-2014-0098
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
  and extensible web server.

  It was found that the mod_dav module did not correctly strip leading white
  space from certain elements in a parsed XML. In certain httpd
  configurations that use the mod_dav module (for example when using the
  mod_dav_svn module), a remote attacker could send a specially crafted DAV
  request that would cause the httpd child process to crash or, possibly,
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  "apache" user. (CVE-2013-6438)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd mod_log_config module.
  In configurations where cookie logging is enabled (on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux it is disabled by default), a remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash the httpd child process via an HTTP request with a malformed cookie
  header. (CVE-2014-0098)

  All httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
