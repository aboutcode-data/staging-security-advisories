  This advisory fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, tendrl-node-agent service was unable to import the cluster in a VMware environment as tendrl was looking for the serial number of the devices. With the current update, tendrl-node-agent service is able to import the cluster in a VMware environment without failure as the hardware_id and parent_id of the devices are used after proper validation instead of the serial number. (BZ#1809920)

  Users of web-admin-build with Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
