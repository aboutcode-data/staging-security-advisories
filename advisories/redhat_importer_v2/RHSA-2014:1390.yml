summary: |
  Updated luci packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Luci is a web-based high availability administration application.

  It was discovered that luci used eval() on inputs containing strings from
  the cluster configuration file when generating its web pages. An attacker
  with privileges to create or edit the cluster configuration could use this
  flaw to execute arbitrary code as the luci user on a host running luci.
  (CVE-2014-3593)

  This issue was discovered by Jan Pokorný of Red Hat.

  These updated luci packages also include several bug fixes and multiple
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
