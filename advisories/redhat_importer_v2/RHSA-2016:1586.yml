  - CVE-2016-5403
summary: |
  An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the virtio framework is vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue. It was found that a malicious guest user could submit more requests than the virtqueue size permits. Processing a request allocates a VirtQueueElement and therefore causes unbounded memory allocation on the host controlled by the guest. (CVE-2016-5403)

  Red Hat would like to thank hongzhenhao (Marvel Team) for reporting this issue.
