summary: |
  An updated xpdf package that fixes several security issues is now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 20 Dec 2005]
  The initial fix for these issues was incomplete. The packages have been
  updated with a more complete fix.

  The xpdf package is an X Window System-based viewer for Portable Document
  Format (PDF) files.

  Several flaws were discovered in Xpdf.  An attacker could construct a
  carefully crafted PDF file that could cause Xpdf to crash or possibly
  execute arbitrary code when opened.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project assigned the names CVE-2005-3191, CVE-2005-3192, and
  CVE-2005-3193 to these issues.

  Users of Xpdf should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve these issues.

  Red Hat would like to thank Derek B. Noonburg for reporting this issue and
  providing a patch.
