summary: "Updated packages that resolve various issues are now available for Red Hat\nEnterprise\
  \ Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform\
  \ provides the facilities for\nbuilding a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)\
  \ cloud\nrunning on commonly available physical hardware.\n\nThis update addresses the following\
  \ issues:\n\n* This package rebases mariadb-galera to 5.5.42, fixing an issue where duplicate\
  \ key errors would occur during INSERT statements, when performed during the period when database\
  \ connectivity was moving to another Galera node, and when the first node was entering a non-available\
  \ state. (BZ#1240114)\n\n* Previously, a call to the 'sed' command within 'mysqld_safe.sh'\
  \ (to certain command line arguments) failed to accommodate arguments which include a slash,\
  \ such as the paths to SSL key and certificate files which are passed through this function.\
  \ \nConsequently, the 'mysqld_safe.sh' script produced warnings of the form \"unknown option\
  \ to `s'\". However, the script continued to work correctly, as these arguments are not actually\
  \ needed in this specific context. \nThis update addresses this issue by correcting the call\
  \ to 'sed' so that SSL arguments which include slashes are properly interpreted. \nAs a result,\
  \ the warnings regarding 'sed' are now resolved. (BZ#1134033)\n\n* Previously, a default logrotate\
  \ configuration was not provided. This update adds a default config, rotating based on log\
  \ size rather than time, avoiding long logs as per current RHEL OpenStack Platform standards.\
  \ (BZ#1212488)\n\n* Previously, the HDP plug-in installed the 'Extra Packages for Enterprise\
  \ Linux (EPEL)' repo on cluster generation, even though neither the plug-in nor the saraha-image-elements\
  \ package used the repo. Consequently, a potentially error-prone step was introduced into\
  \ HDP cluster generation; in addition, these clusters may potentially update to unsupported\
  \ packages. \nWith this update, the repo is no longer installed by the HDP plug-in. (BZ#1231922)\n\
  \n* Previously, the neutron VPN agent received an incorrect SELinux context. Consequently,\
  \ SELinux was causing the VPN agent to fail. \nThis update addresses this issue by changing\
  \ the type to 'neutron_vpn_agent_t'. \nAs a result, the VPN agent now runs as expected. (BZ#1238360)\n\
  \n* Previously, SELinux prevented glance from creating a symlink. Consequently, users could\
  \ not use /home/glance to replace /var/lib/glance. \nThis fix addresses the issue by granting\
  \ Image Service permission to create a symlink to glance types. \nAs a result, users can now\
  \ free up space in the / directory by symlinking /var/lib/glance to /home/glance. (BZ#1210271)\n\
  \n* Previously, glance's VMware vSphere store failed to handle 401 errors correctly. These\
  \ errors were raised after the vSphere session had expired, causing long-standing operations,\
  \ such as snapshots, to fail. This update resolves the issue, allowing these operations to\
  \ succeed. (BZ#1200075)\n\n* Previously, oslo.messaging could enter a loop while waiting for\
  \ messages, if RabbitMQ had died. \nThis update adds a more precise timeout handling for message\
  \ consumption, allowing the poll operations on specific connections to end whenever such scenarios\
  \ occur. (BZ#1188304)\n\n* This update addresses potential race conditions involving the 'oslo'\
  \ messaging backend used in RabbitMQ. (BZ#1188309)\n\n* Previously, the GM process would send\
  \ a message to terminate all slaves  once the master process terminated, but would not wait\
  \ for confirmation that the slaves had received this message before terminating itself. As\
  \ a result, a slave that did not receive the message would detect that the master GM process\
  \ had terminated and promote itself to master, causing the previous master process to hang.\n\
  With this update, the GM process now waits for its broadcast buffer to empty before terminating.\
  \ This results in all slaves receiving the message to terminate, allowing the master process\
  \ to terminate as expected. (BZ#1239141)\n\n* This rebase package contains an updated snapshot\
  \ from the LTS upstream 'branch-2.3' that includes multiple bugfixes. (BZ#1250221)"
