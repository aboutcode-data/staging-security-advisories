summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and various bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * IPv6 fragment identification value generation could allow a remote
  attacker to disrupt a target system's networking, preventing legitimate
  users from accessing its services. (CVE-2011-2699, Important)

  * A signedness issue was found in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet
  File System) implementation. A malicious CIFS server could send a
  specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in
  a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS
  share mounted. (CVE-2011-3191, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled fragmented IPv6 UDP
  datagrams over the bridge with UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO)
  functionality on. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial
  of service. (CVE-2011-4326, Important)

  * The way IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs were
  generated could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and
  possibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are
  now more random. (CVE-2011-3188, Moderate)

  * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem
  in Userspace) implementation. A local user in the fuse group who has access
  to mount a FUSE file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-3353, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the b43 driver in the Linux kernel. If a system had
  an active wireless interface that uses the b43 driver, an attacker able to
  send a specially-crafted frame to that interface could cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-3359, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way CIFS shares with DFS referrals at their root
  were handled. An attacker on the local network who is able to deploy a
  malicious CIFS server could create a CIFS network share that, when mounted,
  would cause the client system to crash. (CVE-2011-3363, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled VLAN 0 frames with
  the priority tag set. When using certain network drivers, an attacker on
  the local network could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-3593, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the way memory containing security-related data was handled in
  tpm_read() could allow a local, unprivileged user to read the results of a
  previously run TPM command. (CVE-2011-1162, Low)

  * A heap overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition
  Table (GPT) implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause
  a denial of service by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted
  partition tables. (CVE-2011-1577, Low)

  * The I/O statistics from the taskstats subsystem could be read without
  any restrictions. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to gather
  confidential information, such as the length of a password used in a
  process. (CVE-2011-2494, Low)

  * It was found that the perf tool, a part of the Linux kernel's Performance
  Events implementation, could load its configuration file from the current
  working directory. If a local user with access to the perf tool were
  tricked into running perf in a directory that contains a specially-crafted
  configuration file, it could cause perf to overwrite arbitrary files and
  directories accessible to that user. (CVE-2011-2905, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Fernando Gont for reporting CVE-2011-2699;
  Darren Lavender for reporting CVE-2011-3191; Dan Kaminsky for reporting
  CVE-2011-3188; Yogesh Sharma for reporting CVE-2011-3363; Gideon Naim for
  reporting CVE-2011-3593; Peter Huewe for reporting CVE-2011-1162; Timo
  Warns for reporting CVE-2011-1577; and Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for
  reporting CVE-2011-2494.

  This update also fixes various bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.
