summary: |
  An update for bash is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The bash packages provide Bash (Bourne-again shell), which is the default shell for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An arbitrary command injection flaw was found in the way bash processed the hostname value. A malicious DHCP server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the DHCP client machines running bash under specific circumstances. (CVE-2016-0634)

  * An arbitrary command injection flaw was found in the way bash processed the SHELLOPTS and PS4 environment variables. A local, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to exploit poorly written setuid programs to elevate their privileges under certain circumstances. (CVE-2016-7543)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way bash handled popd commands. A poorly written shell script could cause bash to crash resulting in a local denial of service limited to a specific bash session. (CVE-2016-9401)
