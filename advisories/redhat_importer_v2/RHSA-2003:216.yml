aliases:
  - CVE-2002-1384
  - CVE-2003-0434
summary: |
  Updated Xpdf packages are available that fix a vulnerability where a
  malicious PDF document could run arbitrary code.

  Xpdf is an X Window System based viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
  files.

  During an audit of CUPS, a printing system, Zen Parsec found an integer
  overflow vulnerability in the pdftops filter. Since the code for pdftops is
  taken from the Xpdf project, all versions of Xpdf including 2.01 are also
  vulnerable to this issue. An attacker could create a PDF file that could
  execute arbitrary code. This code would have the same access privileges as
  the user who viewed the file with Xpdf.

  Martyn Gilmore discovered a flaw in various PDF viewers and readers.  An
  attacker can embed malicious external-type hyperlinks that, if activated or
  followed by a victim, can execute arbitrary shell commands.   The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0434 to this issue.

  All users of Xpdf are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
  contain a patch correcting this issue.
