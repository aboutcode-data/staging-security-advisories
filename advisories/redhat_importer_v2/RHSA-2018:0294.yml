  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.2 is now available for download from the Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on Infinispan.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.2 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7.1.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)

  * It was found that the Hotrod client in Infinispan would unsafely read deserialized data on information from the cache. An authenticated attacker could inject a malicious object into the data cache and attain deserialization on the client, and possibly conduct further attacks. (CVE-2017-15089)

  * A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)

  Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525 and Man Yue Mo (Semmle/lgtm.com) for reporting CVE-2017-15089.
