summary: "Updated kernel-rt packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and\nadd various\
  \ enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having Important security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each\
  \ vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nThe kernel-rt packages contain\
  \ the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the Linux\
  \ kernel's keys subsystem did not correctly\ngarbage collect uninstantiated keyrings. A local\
  \ attacker could use this\nflaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges\
  \ on the\nsystem. (CVE-2015-7872, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel\
  \ handled IRET faults during\nthe processing of NMIs. An unprivileged, local user could use\
  \ this flaw to\ncrash the system or, potentially (although highly unlikely), escalate their\n\
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-5157, Moderate)\n\nThe kernel-rt packages have been upgraded\
  \ to version 3.10.0-327.10.1, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements, including:\n\
  \n* [md] dm: fix AB-BA deadlock in __dm_destroy() \n\n* [md] revert \"dm-mpath: fix stalls\
  \ when handling invalid ioctl\n\n* [cpufreq] intel_pstate: Fix limits->max_perf and limits->max_policy_pct\n\
  rounding errors\n\n* [cpufreq] revert \"intel_pstate: fix rounding error in max_freq_pct\"\
  \n\n* [crypto] nx: 842 - Add CRC and validation support\n\n* [of] return NUMA_NO_NODE from\
  \ fallback of_node_to_nid()\n\n(BZ#1282591)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\
  \n* Because the realtime kernel replaces most of the spinlocks with\nrtmutexes, the locking\
  \ scheme used in both NAPI polling and busy polling\ncould become out of synchronization with\
  \ the State Machine they protected.\nThis could cause system performance degradation or even\
  \ a livelock\nsituation when a machine with faster NICs (10g or 40g) was subject to a\nheavy\
  \ pressure receiving network packets. The locking schemes on NAPI\npolling and busy polling\
  \ routines have been hardened to enforce the State\nmachine sanity to help ensure the system\
  \ continues to function properly\nunder pressure. (BZ#1293230)\n\n* A possible livelock in\
  \ the NAPI polling and busy polling routines could\nlead the system to a livelock on threads\
  \ running at high, realtime,\npriorities. The threads running at priorities lower than the\
  \ ones of the\nthreads involved in the livelock were prevented from running on the CPUs\n\
  affected by the livelock. Among those lower priority threads are the rcuc/\nthreads. With\
  \ this update, right before (4 jiffies) a RCU stall is\ndetected, the rcuc/ threads on the\
  \ CPUs facing the livelock have their\npriorities boosted above the priority of the threads\
  \ involved in the\nlivelock. The softirq code has also been updated to be more robust.\nThese\
  \ modifications allow the rcuc/ threads to execute even under system\npressure, mitigating\
  \ the RCU stalls. (BZ#1293229)\n\n* Multiple CPUs trying to take an rq lock previously caused\
  \ large latencies\non machines with many CPUs. On systems with more than 32 cores, this update\n\
  uses the \"push\" rather than \"pull\" approach and provides multiple changes\nto the scheduling\
  \ of rq locks. As a result, machines no longer suffer from\nmultiplied latencies on large\
  \ CPU systems. (BZ#1282597)\n\n* Previously, the SFC driver for 10 GB cards executed polling\
  \ in NAPI mode,\nusing a locking mechanism similar to a \"trylock\". Consequently, when\n\
  running on a Realtime kernel, a livelock could occur. This update modifies\nthe locking mechanism\
  \ so that once the lock is taken it is not released\nuntil the operation is complete. (BZ#1282609)\n\
  \nAll kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these\
  \ issues and add these enhancements. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take\
  \ effect."
