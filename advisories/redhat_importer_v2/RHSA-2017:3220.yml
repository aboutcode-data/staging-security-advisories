summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.18 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.17, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that while parsing the SAML messages the StaxParserUtil class of Picketlink replaces special strings for obtaining attribute values with system property. This could allow an attacker to determine values of system properties at the attacked system by formatting the SAML request ID field to be the chosen system property which could be obtained in the "InResponseTo" field in the response. (CVE-2017-2582)

  This issue was discovered by Hynek Mlnarik (Red Hat).
