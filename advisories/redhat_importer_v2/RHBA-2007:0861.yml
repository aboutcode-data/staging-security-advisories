summary: |
  Updated dlm-kernel packages that fix module loading issues and various bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update 5, kernel release
  2.6.9-55.0.6.EL.

  The dlm-kernel modules allow the Distributed Lock Manager (dlm) to
  communicate with the kernel.

  These updated dlm-kernel packages are in sync with the latest kernel
  (2.6.9-55.0.6.EL). The modules in earlier dlm-kernel packages failed to
  load because they did not match the running kernel. It was possible to
  force load the modules. With this update, however, users no longer need to.

  As well, the following issues have been addressed in this update:

  * a bug was fixed which could cause a crash when /proc/cluster/dlm_locks
  was viewed.

  * a bug was fixed which caused dlm operations to block when a tcp
  connection was initiated to the dlm port.

  * a bug was fixed which caused cman to incorrectly report that clvmd
  startup failed.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these latest dlm-kernel packages, which are
  updated for use with the 2.6.9-55.0.6.EL kernel.
