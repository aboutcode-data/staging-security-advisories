aliases:
  - CVE-2008-6552
  - CVE-2010-3389
summary: |
  An updated rgmanager package that fixes multiple security issues and
  several bugs is now available for Red Hat Cluster Suite 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rgmanager package contains the Red Hat Resource Group Manager, which
  provides high availability for critical server applications.

  Multiple insecure temporary file use flaws were discovered in rgmanager and
  various resource scripts run by rgmanager. A local attacker could use these
  flaws to overwrite an arbitrary file writable by the rgmanager process
  (i.e. user root) with the output of rgmanager or a resource agent via a
  symbolic link attack. (CVE-2008-6552)

  It was discovered that certain resource agent scripts set the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to an insecure value containing empty
  path elements. A local user able to trick a user running those scripts to
  run them while working from an attacker-writable directory could use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges via a specially-crafted dynamic library.
  (CVE-2010-3389)

  Red Hat would like to thank Raphael Geissert for reporting the
  CVE-2010-3389 issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, starting threads could incorrectly include a reference to an
  exited thread if that thread exited when rgmanager received a request
  to start a new thread. Due to this issue, the new thread did not retry and
  entered an infinite loop. This update ensures that new threads do not
  reference old threads. Now, new threads no longer enter an infinite loop
  in which the rgmanager enables and disables services without failing
  gracefully. (BZ#502872)

  * Previously, nfsclient.sh left temporary nfsclient-status-cache-$$ files
  in /tmp/. (BZ#506152)

  * Previously, the function local_node_name in
  /resources/utils/member_util.sh did not correctly check whether magma_tool
  failed. Due to this issue, empty strings could be returned. This update
  checks the input and rejects empty strings. (BZ#516758)

  * Previously, the file system agent could kill a process when an
  application used a mount point with a similar name to a mount point managed
  by rgmanager using force_unmount. With this update, the file system agent
  kills only the processes that access the mount point managed by rgmanager.
  (BZ#555901)

  * Previously, simultaneous execution of "lvchange --deltag" from
  /etc/init.d/rgmanager caused a checksum error on High Availability Logical
  Volume Manager (HA-LVM). With this update, ownership of LVM tags is checked
  before removing them. (BZ#559582)

  * Previously, the isAlive check could fail if two nodes used the same file
  name. With this update, the isAlive function prevents two nodes from using
  the same file name. (BZ#469815)

  * Previously, the S/Lang code could lead to unwanted S/Lang stack leaks
  during event processing. (BZ#507430)

  All users of rgmanager are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which corrects these issues.
