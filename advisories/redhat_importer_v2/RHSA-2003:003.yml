summary: |
  A security issue has been found in KDE. This errata provides updates which
  resolve these issues.

  KDE is a graphical desktop environment for the X Window System.

  before passing them to a command shell. This could allow remote
  attackers to execute arbitrary commands through carefully crafted URLs,
  filenames, or email addresses.

  Users of KDE are advised to install the updated packages which contain
  backported patches to correct this issue.

  Please note that for the Itanium (IA64) architecture only, this update also
  fixes several other vulnerabilities. Details concerning these
