summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0, which fixes multiple security
  issues and several bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that
  provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss
  Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 release serves as a replacement for
  JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to
  the JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0 Release Notes for information on the
  most significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available
  shortly from https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
  protected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  prevention filter. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform CSRF
  attacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter and do
  not contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)

  The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
  hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
  subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
  that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

  A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
  validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
  arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
  SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
  XML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Operations
  Network installation (including its databases, applications, configuration
  files, the JBoss Operations Network server's file system directory, and so
  on).

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.0.
