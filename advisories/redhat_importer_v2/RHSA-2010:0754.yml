  - CVE-2010-3702
summary: |
  Updated cups packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX operating systems. The CUPS "pdftops" filter converts Portable
  Document Format (PDF) files to PostScript.

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in the CUPS "pdftops"
  filter. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that, when printed,
  would cause "pdftops" to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as
  the "lp" user. (CVE-2010-3702)

  Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.
