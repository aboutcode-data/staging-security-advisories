  - CVE-2009-4145
summary: |
  Updated NetworkManager packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  NetworkManager is a network link manager that attempts to keep a wired or
  wireless network connection active at all times.

  A missing network certificate verification flaw was found in
  NetworkManager. If a user created a WPA Enterprise or 802.1x wireless
  network connection that was verified using a Certificate Authority (CA)
  certificate, and then later removed that CA certificate file,
  NetworkManager failed to verify the identity of the network on the
  following connection attempts. In these situations, a malicious wireless
  network spoofing the original network could trick a user into disclosing
  authentication credentials or communicating over an untrusted network.
  (CVE-2009-4144)

  An information disclosure flaw was found in NetworkManager's
  nm-connection-editor D-Bus interface. If a user edited network connection
  options using nm-connection-editor, a summary of those changes was
  broadcasted over the D-Bus message bus, possibly disclosing sensitive
  information (such as wireless network authentication credentials) to other
  local users. (CVE-2009-4145)

  Users of NetworkManager should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
