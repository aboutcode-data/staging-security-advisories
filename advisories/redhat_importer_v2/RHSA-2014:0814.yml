  - CVE-2014-3485
summary: |
  Updated rhevm packages that fix one security issue are now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a centralized management
  platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual
  machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including
  search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual
  infrastructure provisioning.

  The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several
  interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and
  interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a
  Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface
  (API).

  It was found that the ovirt-engine REST API resolved entities in XML API
  calls. A remote attacker with credentials to call the ovirt-engine REST
  API could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the
  ovirt-engine JBoss server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE
  attacks. (CVE-2014-3485)

  This issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.

  All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
  to these updated packages, which resolve this issue.
