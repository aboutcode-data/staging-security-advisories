  - CVE-2009-3290
summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  The kvm_emulate_hypercall() implementation was missing a check for the
  Current Privilege Level (CPL). A local, unprivileged user in a virtual
  machine could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate
  their privileges within that virtual machine. (CVE-2009-3290)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * non-maskable interrupts (NMI) were not supported on systems with AMD
  processors. As a consequence, Windows Server 2008 R2 guests running with
  more than one virtual CPU assigned on systems with AMD processors would
  hang at the Windows shut down screen when a restart was attempted. This
  update adds support for NMI filtering on systems with AMD processors,
  allowing clean restarts of Windows Server 2008 R2 guests running with
  multiple virtual CPUs. (BZ#520694)

  * significant performance issues for guests running 64-bit editions of
  Windows. This update improves performance for guests running 64-bit
  editions of Windows. (BZ#521793)

  * Windows guests may have experienced time drift. (BZ#521794)

  * removing the Red Hat VirtIO Ethernet Adapter from a guest running Windows
  Server 2008 R2 caused KVM to crash. With this update, device removal should
  not cause this issue. (BZ#524557)

  All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The procedure in the
  Solution section must be performed before this update takes effect.
