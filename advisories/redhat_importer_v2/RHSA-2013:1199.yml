summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix multiple security issues and
  various bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (Nova), which
  provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual machine
  instances.

  It was found that the fixes for CVE-2013-1664 and CVE-2013-1665, released
  via RHSA-2013:0657, did not fully correct the issues in the Extensible
  Markup Language (XML) parser used by Nova. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to a Nova API, causing
  Nova to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory, or possibly crash.
  (CVE-2013-4179)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Nova handled network source
  security group policy updates. An authenticated user could send a large
  number of server creation operations, causing nova-network to become
  unresponsive. (CVE-2013-4185)

  An information disclosure flaw and a resource limit bypass were found in
  the way Nova handled virtual hardware templates (flavors). These allowed
  tenants to show and boot other tenants' flavors and bypass resource limits
  enforced via the os-flavor-access:is_public property. (CVE-2013-2256)

  It was discovered that, in some configurations, certain messages in
  console-log could cause nova-compute to become unresponsive, resulting in a
  denial of service. (CVE-2013-4261)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
  CVE-2013-2256 and CVE-2013-4185. Upstream acknowledges hzrandd from NetEase
  as the original reporter of CVE-2013-2256, and Vishvananda Ishaya
  from Nebula as the original reporter of CVE-2013-4185. Upstream also
  acknowledges Ken'ichi Ohmichi from NEC for providing a corrected fix for
  CVE-2013-2256.

  The CVE-2013-4179 issue was discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team, and CVE-2013-4261 was discovered by Jaroslav Henner
  of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes a number of bugs in openstack-nova.

  Additionally, openstack-nova has been rebased to the latest stable release
  2013.1.3. (BZ#993100)

  All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the running Nova services will be restarted automatically.
