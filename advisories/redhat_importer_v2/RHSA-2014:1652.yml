  - CVE-2014-3567
summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that contain a backported patch to mitigate the
  CVE-2014-3566 issue and fix two security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
  Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security
  (DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography
  library.

  This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
  (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
  attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
  protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
  supported protocol version fails.

  This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
  The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
  attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
  This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
  POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
  update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
  require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

  For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
  at https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123

  A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed the DTLS Secure
  Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension data. A remote attacker could
  send multiple specially crafted handshake messages to exhaust all available
  memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server. (CVE-2014-3513)

  A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed session
  ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all available
  memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number of invalid
  session tickets to that server. (CVE-2014-3567)

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to mitigate the CVE-2014-3566 issue and correct
  the CVE-2014-3513 and CVE-2014-3567 issues. For the update to take effect,
  all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
  SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
