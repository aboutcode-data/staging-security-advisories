summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nA response-splitting issue was discovered in the\
  \ PHP session handling.  If\na remote attacker can force a carefully crafted session identifier\
  \ to be\nused, a cross-site-scripting or response-splitting attack could be\npossible.  (CVE-2006-3016)\n\
  \nA buffer overflow was discovered found in the PHP sscanf() function.  If a\nscript used\
  \ the sscanf() function with positional arguments in the format\nstring, a remote attacker\
  \ sending a carefully crafted request could execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user.\
  \  (CVE-2006-4020)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP wordwrap() and str_repeat()\n\
  functions.  If a script running on a 64-bit server used either of these\nfunctions on untrusted\
  \ user data, a remote attacker sending a carefully\ncrafted request might be able to cause\
  \ a heap overflow.  (CVE-2006-4482)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory\
  \ allocation handling. \nOn 64-bit platforms, the \"memory_limit\" setting was not enforced\
  \ correctly,\nwhich could allow a denial of service attack by a remote user.  (CVE-2006-4486)\n\
  \nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches\
  \ to correct these issues.  These packages also contain a\nfix for a bug where certain input\
  \ strings to the metaphone() function could\ncause memory corruption."
