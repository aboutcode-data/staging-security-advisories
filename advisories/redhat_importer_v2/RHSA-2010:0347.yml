  - CVE-2010-0826
summary: |
  Updated nss_db packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The nss_db packages provide a set of C library extensions which allow
  Berkeley Database (Berkeley DB) databases to be used as a primary source of
  aliases, ethers, groups, hosts, networks, protocols, users, RPCs, services,
  and shadow passwords. These databases are used instead of or in addition to
  the flat files used by these tools by default.

  It was discovered that nss_db did not specify a path to the directory to be
  used as the database environment for the Berkeley Database library, causing
  it to use the current working directory as the default. This could possibly
  allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2010-0826)

  Users of nss_db are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
