  - CVE-2011-0419
summary: |
  Updated apr packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is a portability library used by the
  Apache HTTP Server and other projects. It provides a free library of C data
  structures and routines.

  It was discovered that the apr_fnmatch() function used an unconstrained
  recursion when processing patterns with the '*' wildcard. An attacker could
  use this flaw to cause an application using this function, which also
  accepted untrusted input as a pattern for matching (such as an httpd server
  using the mod_autoindex module), to exhaust all stack memory or use an
  excessive amount of CPU time when performing matching. (CVE-2011-0419)

  Red Hat would like to thank Maksymilian Arciemowicz for reporting this
  issue.

  All apr users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. Applications using the apr library,
  such as httpd, must be restarted for this update to take effect.
