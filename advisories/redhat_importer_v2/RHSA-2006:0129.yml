  - CVE-2005-3351
summary: "An updated spamassassin package that fixes a denial of service flaw is now\navailable.\n\
  \nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nSpamAssassin provides a way to reduce unsolicited commercial email (SPAM)\nfrom\
  \ incoming email.\n\nA denial of service bug was found in SpamAssassin.  An attacker could\n\
  construct a message in such a way that would cause SpamAssassin to crash. \nIf a number of\
  \ these messages are sent, it could lead to a denial of\nservice, potentially preventing the\
  \ delivery or filtering of email. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ assigned the\nname CVE-2005-3351 to this issue.\n\nThe following issues have also been fixed\
  \ in this update:\n\n* service spamassassin restart sometimes fails\n* Content Boundary \"\
  --\" throws off message parser\n* sa-learn: massive memory usage on large messages\n* High\
  \ memory usage with many newlines\n* service spamassassin messages not translated\n* Numerous\
  \ other bug fixes that improve spam filter accuracy and safety\n\nUsers of SpamAssassin should\
  \ upgrade to this updated package containing\nversion 3.0.5, which is not vulnerable to these\
  \ issues."
