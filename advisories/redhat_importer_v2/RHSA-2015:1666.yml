summary: |
  Updated httpd24-httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Software Collections 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
  and extensible web server.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
  responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
  these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
  differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
  HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

  It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function
  ap_some_auth_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was
  authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using
  this API function could consequently allow access that should have been
  denied. (CVE-2015-3185)

  Note: This update introduces new a new API function,
  ap_some_authn_required(), which correctly indicates if a request is
  authenticated. External httpd modules using the old API function should be
  modified to use the new one to completely resolve this issue.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the mod_lua httpd module
  processed certain WebSocket Ping requests. A remote attacker could send a
  specially crafted WebSocket Ping packet that would cause the httpd child
  process to crash. (CVE-2015-0228)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way httpd generated
  certain error responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  crash the httpd child process using a request that triggers a certain HTTP
  error. (CVE-2015-0253)

  All httpd24-httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  the updated packages, the httpd24-httpd service will be restarted
  automatically.
