summary: "Updated nss_ldap packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1,\n7.2, and\
  \ 7.3. These updates fix a potential buffer overflow which can occur\nwhen nss_ldap is set\
  \ to configure itself using information stored in DNS,\na format string bug in logging functions\
  \ used in pam_ldap, and to properly\nhandle truncated DNS responses.\n\nnss_ldap is a set\
  \ of C library extensions that allow X.500 and LDAP\ndirectory servers to be used as a primary\
  \ source of aliases, ethers,\ngroups, hosts, networks, protocols, users, RPCs, services, and\
  \ shadow\npasswords (instead of or in addition to using flat files or NIS).\n\nWhen versions\
  \ of nss_ldap prior to nss_ldap-198 are configured without a\nvalue for the \"host\" setting,\
  \ nss_ldap will attempt to configure itself by\nusing SRV records stored in DNS.  When parsing\
  \ the results of the DNS\nquery, nss_ldap does not check that the data returned by the server\
  \ will\nfit into an internal buffer, leaving it vulnerable to a buffer overflow.\nThe Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0825\
  \ to this issue.\n\nWhen versions of nss_ldap prior to nss_ldap-199 are configured without\
  \ a\nvalue for the \"host\" setting, nss_ldap will attempt to configure itself by\nusing SRV\
  \ records stored in DNS.  When parsing the results of the DNS\nquery, nss_ldap does not check\
  \ that the data returned has not been\ntruncated by the resolver libraries to avoid a buffer\
  \ overflow, and may\nattempt to parse more data than is actually available, leaving it\nvulnerable\
  \ to a read buffer overflow.  \n\nVersions of pam_ldap prior to version 144 include a format\
  \ string bug in\nthe logging function. The packages included in this erratum update pam_ldap\n\
  to version 144, fixing this bug.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2002-0374 to this issue.\n\nAll users of nss_ldap should update\
  \ to these errata packages which are not\nvulnerable to the above issues. The errata packages\
  \ are based on\nnss_ldap-189 with the addition of a backported security patch and pam_ldap\n\
  version 144.\n\nThanks to the nss_ldap and pam_ldap team at padl.com for providing\ninformation\
  \ about these issues."
