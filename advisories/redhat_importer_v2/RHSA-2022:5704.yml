  - CVE-2022-29173
summary: "Updated images are now available for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security. The updated\
  \ image includes bug fixes and feature improvements.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated\
  \ this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System\
  \ (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability\
  \ from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nRelease of ACS 3.71 provides these changes:\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* go-tuf: No protection against rollback attacks for roles other than\
  \ root (CVE-2022-29173)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact,\
  \ a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed\
  \ in the References section.\n\nNew Features:\n\n* New RHACS dashboard and widgets\n* New\
  \ default policy for privilege escalation: detects if a deployment is running with a container\
  \ that has allowPrivilegeEscalation set to true. This policy is enabled by default. The privilege\
  \ escalation setting is enabled in Kubernetes pods by default.\n* New default policy for externally\
  \ exposed service: detects if a deployment has any service that is externally exposed through\
  \ any methods. The policy is disabled by default. \n* Ability to assign multiple RHACS roles\
  \ to users and groups: Allows you to assign multiple roles using key-value pairs to a single\
  \ user or group. \n* List of network policies in Deployment tab for violations: A new information\
  \ section has been added to help resolve a \"missing Kubernetes network policy\" violation\
  \ that lists all the Kubernetes network policies applicable to the namespace of the offending\
  \ deployment. \n* Alpine 3.16 support for Scanner\n\nEnhancements:\n* Change to roxctl image\
  \ scan behavior: The default value for the --include-snoozed option of the roxctl image scan\
  \ command is set to false. If the --include-snoozed option is set to false, the scan does\
  \ not include snoozed CVEs.\n* Diagnostic bundles update: These now include notifiers, auth\
  \ providers and auth provider groups, access control roles with attached permission set and\
  \ access scope, and system configuration information. Users with the DebugLogs permission\
  \ can read listed entities from a generated diagnostic bundle regardless of their respective\
  \ permissions.\n* Align OCP4-CIS scanning benchmarks control numbers: The CIS control number\
  \ has been added to compliance scan results to enable customers to reference the original\
  \ control from the CIS benchmark standard.\n\nNotable technical changes:\n* eBPF is now the\
  \ default collection method: Updated the default collection method for Collector to eBPF.\
  \ \n\nDeprecated features:\n\n* RenamePolicyCategory and DeletePolicyCategory API endpoints\n\
  * Permissions: AuthPlugin, AuthProvider, Group, Licenses, Role, User, Indicator, NetworkBaseline,\
  \ ProcessWhitelist, Risk, APIToken, BackupPlugins, ImageIntegration, Notifier, SignatureIntegration,\
  \ ImageComponent\n* Retrieving groups by property\n* vulns fields of storage.Node object in\
  \ response payload of v1/nodes\n* /v1/cves/suppress and /v1/cves/unsuppress\n\nRemoved features:\n\
  \n* Anchore, Tenable, and Docker Trusted Registry integrations\n* External authorization plug-in\
  \ for scoped access control\n* FROM option in the Disallowed Dockerfile line policy field\n\
  * PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) Kubernetes objects"
