  - CVE-2015-0240
summary: |
  Updated samba3x packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9
  Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the Samba daemon (smbd).
  A malicious Samba client could send specially crafted netlogon packets
  that, when processed by smbd, could potentially lead to arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of the user running smbd (by default, the
  root user). (CVE-2015-0240)

  For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
  at https://access.redhat.com/articles/1346913

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Richard van Eeden of Microsoft Vulnerability Research
  as the original reporter of this issue.

  All Samba users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
