summary: |
  An update for the GateIn Portal component in JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.2 that fixes two security issues is now available from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  It was found that the GateIn Portal export/import gadget allowed an export
  ZIP to be uploaded and imported to a site without authentication. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a site, remove the
  site, or modify access controls applied to portlets in the site.
  (CVE-2013-0314)

  It was found that the GateIn Portal export/import gadget was vulnerable to
  XXE (XML External Entity) attacks. If the XML provided to the import gadget
  contained an external XML entity, this XML entity would be resolved. A
  remote attacker who can access the import gadget could use this flaw to
  read files in the context of the user running the application server.
  (CVE-2013-0315)

  The CVE-2013-0314 issue was discovered by Nick Scavelli of Red Hat, and
  CVE-2013-0315 was discovered by Arun Neelicattu and David Jorm of the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files, and any databases and database settings.
