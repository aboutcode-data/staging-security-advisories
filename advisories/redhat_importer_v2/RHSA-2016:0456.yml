summary: |
  Updated rh-ror41-rubygem-actionview packages that fix two security issues
  are now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The rh-ror41 collection provides Ruby on Rails version 4.1. Ruby on Rails
  is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.

  The following issues were corrected in rubygem-actionview:

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Action View component
  searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted
  input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use
  this flaw to render unexpected files and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2016-2097)

  A code injection flaw was found in the way the Action View component
  searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted
  input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use
  this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2098)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Jyoti Singh and Tobias Kraze (makandra) as
  original reporters of CVE-2016-2097, and Tobias Kraze (makandra) and
  joernchen (Phenoelit) as original reporters of CVE-2016-2098.

  All rh-ror41 collection rubygem-actionview packages users are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to
  correct these issues. All running applications using the rh-ror41
  collection must be restarted for this update to take effect.
