  - CVE-2015-1827
summary: |
  Updated ipa and slapi-nis packages that fix two security issues and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Identity Management is a centralized authentication, identity
  management, and authorization solution for both traditional and cloud-based
  enterprise environments. It integrates components of the Red Hat Directory
  Server, MIT Kerberos, Red Hat Certificate System, NTP, and DNS. It provides
  web browser and command-line interfaces. Its administration tools allow an
  administrator to quickly install, set up, and administer a group of domain
  controllers to meet the authentication and identity management requirements
  of large-scale Linux and UNIX deployments.

  The ipa component provides centrally managed Identity, Policy, and Audit.
  The slapi-nis component provides NIS Server and Schema Compatibility
  plug-ins for Directory Server.

  It was discovered that the IPA extdom Directory Server plug-in did not
  correctly perform memory reallocation when handling user account
  information. A request for a list of groups for a user that belongs to a
  large number of groups would cause a Directory Server to crash.
  (CVE-2015-1827)

  It was discovered that the slapi-nis Directory Server plug-in did not
  correctly perform memory reallocation when handling user account
  information. A request for information about a group with many members, or
  a request for a user that belongs to a large number of groups, would cause
  a Directory Server to enter an infinite loop and consume an excessive
  amount of CPU time. (CVE-2015-0283)

  These issues were discovered by Sumit Bose of Red Hat.

  This update fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, users of IdM were not properly granted the default permission
  to read the "facsimiletelephonenumber" user attribute. This update adds
  "facsimiletelephonenumber" to the Access Control Instruction (ACI) for user
  data, which makes the attribute readable to authenticated users as
  expected. (BZ#1198430)

  * Prior to this update, when a DNS zone was saved in an LDAP database
  without a dot character (.) at the end, internal DNS commands and
  operations, such as dnsrecord-* or dnszone-*, failed. With this update, DNS
  commands always supply the DNS zone with a dot character at the end, which
  prevents the described problem. (BZ#1198431)

  * After a full-server IdM restore operation, the restored server in some
  cases contained invalid data. In addition, if the restored server was used
  to reinitialize a replica, the replica then contained invalid data as well.
  To fix this problem, the IdM API is now created correctly during the
  restore operation, and *.ldif files are not skipped during the removal of
  RUV data. As a result, the restored server and its replica no longer
  contain invalid data. (BZ#1199060)

  * Previously, a deadlock in some cases occurred during an IdM upgrade,
  which could cause the IdM server to become unresponsive. With this update,
  the Schema Compatibility plug-in has been adjusted not to parse the subtree
  that contains the configuration of the DNA plug-in, which prevents this
  deadlock from triggering. (BZ#1199128)

  * When using the extdom plug-in of IdM to handle large groups, user lookups
  and group lookups previously failed due to insufficient buffer size.
  With this update, the getgrgid_r() call gradually increases the buffer
  length if needed, and the described failure of extdom thus no longer
  occurs. (BZ#1203204)

  Users of ipa and slapi-nis are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
