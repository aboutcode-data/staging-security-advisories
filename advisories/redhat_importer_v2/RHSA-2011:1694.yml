summary: |
  Updated libcap packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libcap packages provide a library and tools for getting and setting
  POSIX capabilities.

  It was found that capsh did not change into the new root when using the
  "--chroot" option. An application started via the "capsh --chroot" command
  could use this flaw to escape the chroot restrictions. (CVE-2011-4099)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, the libcap packages did not contain the capsh(1) manual page.
  With this update, the capsh(1) manual page is included. (BZ#730957)

  All libcap users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
