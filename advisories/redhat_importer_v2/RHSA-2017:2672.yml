  - CVE-2017-1000048
summary: |
  An update for rh-nodejs6-nodejs-qs is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The qs module for Node.js is a querystring parser that supports nesting and arrays with a depth limit.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-nodejs6-nodejs-qs (6.2.3). (BZ#1485934)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that ljharb's qs module for Node.js did not properly parse query strings. An attacker could send a specially crafted query that overwrites the resulting object's prototype properties (such as toString() or hasOwnProperty()), resulting in a denial of service when the overwritten function would be executed. (CVE-2017-1000048)
