summary: |
  Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.2.4 and fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and add various
  enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  Apache CXF is an open source services framework, which is a part of
  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  It was found that the SecurityTokenService (STS), provided as a part of
  Apache CXF, could under certain circumstances accept invalid SAML tokens as
  valid. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted SAML token to gain
  access to an application that uses STS for validation of SAML tokens.
  (CVE-2014-0034)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache CXF created error
  messages for certain POST requests. A remote attacker could send a
  specially crafted request which, when processed by an application using
  Apache CXF, could consume an excessive amount of memory on the system,
  possibly triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. (CVE-2014-0109)

  It was found that when a large invalid SOAP message was processed by Apache
  CXF, it could be saved to a temporary file in the /tmp directory. A remote
  attacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed
  by an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk
  space, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0110)

  It was found that the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS)
  implementation enabled external entity expansion by default. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of arbitrary files
  accessible to the application server user. (CVE-2014-3481)

  It was discovered that UsernameTokens were sent in plain text by an Apache
  CXF client that used a Symmetric EncryptBeforeSigning password policy.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to obtain the user name
  and password used by the client application using Apache CXF.
  (CVE-2014-0035)

  The CVE-2014-3481 issue was discovered by the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform QE team.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.2.3, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.4 Release Notes, linked to in
  the References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
