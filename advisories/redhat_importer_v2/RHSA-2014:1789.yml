  - CVE-2014-3621
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
  OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
  The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
  user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and
  AWS-style logins.

  A flaw was found in the keystone catalog URL replacement. A user with
  permissions to register an endpoint could use this flaw to leak
  configuration data, including the master admin_token. Only keystone setups
  that allow non-cloud-admin users to create endpoints were affected by this
  issue. (CVE-2014-3621)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original reporter.

  The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1149748)

  All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
