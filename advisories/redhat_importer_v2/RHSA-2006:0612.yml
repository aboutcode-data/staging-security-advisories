  - CVE-2006-3083
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 to
  correct a privilege escalation security flaw.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other through use of symmetric encryption
  and a trusted third party, the KDC.

  A flaw was found where some bundled Kerberos-aware applications would fail
  to check the result of the setuid() call. On Linux 2.6 kernels, the
  setuid() call can fail if certain user limits are hit. A local attacker
  could manipulate their environment in such a way to get the applications to
  continue to run as root, potentially leading to an escalation of
  privileges.  (CVE-2006-3083).

  Users are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain a
  backported fix to correct this issue.
