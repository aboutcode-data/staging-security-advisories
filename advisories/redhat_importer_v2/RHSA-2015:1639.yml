  - CVE-2015-5163
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having an Important
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Image Service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image and immediately store it away. Stored
  images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
  and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  A flaw was found in the OpenStack Image Service (glance) import task
  action. When processing a malicious qcow2 header, glance could be
  tricked into reading an arbitrary file from the glance host. Only
  setups using the glance V2 API are affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-5163)

  Red Hat thanks the OpenStack team for reporting this issue. Upstream
  acknowledges Eric Harney of Red Hat as the original reporter.

  All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which address this vulnerability.
