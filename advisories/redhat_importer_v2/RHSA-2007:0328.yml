summary: "Updated tomcat packages that fix multiple security issues and a bug are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Developer Suite 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nTomcat is a servlet container for Java\
  \ Servlet and JavaServer Pages\ntechnologies.\n\nTomcat was found to accept multiple content-length\
  \ headers in a\nrequest. This could allow attackers to poison a web-cache, bypass web\napplication\
  \ firewall protection, or conduct cross-site scripting attacks. \n(CVE-2005-2090)\n\nTomcat\
  \ permitted various characters as path delimiters. If Tomcat was used\nbehind certain proxies\
  \ and configured to only proxy some contexts, an\nattacker could construct an HTTP request\
  \ to work around the context\nrestriction and potentially access non-proxied content. (CVE-2007-0450)\n\
  \nThe implict-objects.jsp file distributed in the examples webapp displayed a\nnumber of unfiltered\
  \ header values. If the JSP examples are accessible,\nthis flaw could allow a remote attacker\
  \ to perform cross-site scripting\nattacks. (CVE-2006-7195)\n\nUpdated jakarta-commons-modeler\
  \ packages which correct a bug when\nused with Tomcat 5.5.23 are also included.\n\nUsers should\
  \ upgrade to these erratum packages which contain an update to\nTomcat that resolves these\
  \ issues."
