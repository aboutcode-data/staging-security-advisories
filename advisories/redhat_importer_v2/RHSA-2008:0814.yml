  - CVE-2008-3424
summary: |
  Updated condor packages that fix a security issue and several bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Condor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive
  jobs. It provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority
  scheme, and resource monitoring and management.

  A flaw was found in the way Condor interpreted wildcards in authorization
  lists. Certain authorization lists using wildcards in DENY rules, such as
  DENY_WRITE or HOSTDENY_WRITE, that conflict with the definitions in ALLOW
  rules, could permit authenticated remote users to submit computation jobs,
  even when such access should have been denied. (CVE-2008-3424)

  Bug fixes:

  * the /etc/condor/condor_config file started with "What machine is your
  central manager?". The following line was blank, instead of having the
  "CONDOR_HOST" option, causing confusion. The "What machine..." text is now
  removed.

  * condor_config.local defined "LOCK = /tmp/[lock file]". This is no longer
  explicitly defined; however, lock files may be in "/tmp/", and could be
  removed by tmpwatch. A "LOCK_FILE_UPDATE_INTERVAL" option, which defaults
  to eight hours, has been added. This updates the timestamps on lock files,
  preventing them from being removed by tools such as tmpwatch.

  * when a "SCHEDD_NAME" name in condor_config ended with an "@", the
  system's hostname was appended. For example, if "SCHEDD_NAME = test@" was
  configured, "condor_q -name test@" failed with an "Collector has no record
  of schedd/submitter" error. Now, the hostname is not appended when a name
  ends with an "@". In High Availability (HA) Schedd deployments, this allows
  a name to be shared by multiple Schedds.

  * when too few arguments were passed to "condor_qedit", such as
  "condor_qedit -constraint TRUE", a segfault occurred. Better argument
  handling has been added to resolve this.

  * due to missing common_createddl.sql and pgsql_createddl.sql files,
  it was not possible to use Quill. Now, these files are included in
  "/usr/share/condor/sql/".

  * "condor_submit -dump ad [file-name]" caused a segfault if the [file-name]
  job contained "universe = grid".

  * previously, a condor user and group were created if they did not exist,
  without specifying a specific UID and GID. Now, UID and GID 64 are used.
  The effect of this change is non-existent if upgrading the condor packages.
  If an existing condor user and group are manually changed, problems with
  file ownership will occur.

  Configuration changes (from the Condor release notes - see link below):

  * a new CKPT_SERVER_CHECK_PARENT_INTERVAL variable sets the time interval
  between a checkpoint server checking if its parent is running. If the
  parent server has died, the checkpoint server is shut down.

  * a new CKPT_PROBE variable to define an executable for the helper process
  Condor uses for information about the CheckpointPlatform attribute.

  * STARTER_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT now defaults to 300 seconds.

  * new variables (booleans) PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS_STABLE and
  PREEMPTION_RANK_STABLE, configure whether attributes used in
  PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS and PREEMPTION_RANK change during negotiation
  cycles.

  * a new GRIDMANAGER_MAX_WS_DESTROYS_PER_RESOURCE variable, with a
  default value of 5, defines the number of simultaneous WS destroy commands
  that can be sent to a server for type gt4 grid universe jobs.

  * now, VALID_SPOOL_FILES automatically includes the "SCHEDD.lock" lock file
  for condor_schedd HA failover.

  * the default value for SEC_DEFAULT_SESSION_DURATION has been changed from
  8640000 seconds (100 days) to 86400 seconds (one day).

  Important: these updated packages upgrade Condor to version 7.0.4. For a
  full list of changes, refer to the Condor release notes:
  www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.0/8_3Stable_Release.html

  condor users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these
  issues.
