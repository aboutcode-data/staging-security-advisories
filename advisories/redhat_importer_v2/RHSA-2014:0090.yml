summary: |
  Updated openstack-heat packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-heat packages provide heat, a Python implementation of the
  OpenStack Orchestration engine, to launch multiple composite cloud
  applications based on templates.

  It was found that heat did not properly enforce cloudformation-compatible
  API policy rules. An in-instance attacker could use the CreateStack or
  UpdateStack methods to create or update a stack, resulting in a violation
  of the API policy. Note that only setups using Orchestration's
  cloudformation-compatible API were affected. (CVE-2013-6426)

  A flaw was found in the way Orchestration's REST API implementation handled
  modified request paths. An authenticated remote user could use this flaw to
  bypass the tenant-scoping restriction by modifying the request path,
  resulting in privilege escalation. Note that only setups using
  Orchestration's cloudformation-compatible API were affected.
  (CVE-2013-6428)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
  reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as
  the original reporter.

  The openstack-heat packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. The most notable fixes and enhancements are:

  - Auto-scaling has been fixed when AdjustmentType was set to
    PercentChangeInCapacity.

  - A QPID broker restart no longer permanently disrupts subscribed clients.

  - RPC requests are now only serviced by one server in a given topic group.

  - Auto-scaling group growth or shrinkage has been fixed to utilize the full
    available size, regardless of the scaling policy adjustment.

  (BZ#1045430)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The outdated heat-db-setup tool, which only supported local installs, has
  been removed. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4
  Installation and Configuration Guide has been updated to show how to create
  the necessary database and associated tables for Orchestration, allowing
  the deployment of the database server on a local or remote system (see
  Installing the OpenStack Orchestration Service). (BZ#1046326)

  * The heat-engine source code had a hard-coded reference to a Fedora image
  name in the implementation of the AWS-compatible LoadBalancer resource.
  This meant that you could not specify an alternative LoadBalancer image
  name in deployments (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux). A new option
  has been added to the Orchestration configuration file,
  /etc/heat/heat.conf, which is named loadbalancer_template. The new
  loadbalancer_template option can now be used to specify an alternate
  LoadBalancer template that contains a different image name. (BZ#1048215)

  * Due to a packaging error, the heat-manage tool was not working properly
  (which prohibited a successful database creation). This error has been
  fixed by moving the parallel package selection code so that all
  Orchestration tools now use the proper packages for use at runtime.
  (BZ#1048335)

  All openstack-heat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
