  - CVE-2013-4202
summary: |
  Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-cinder packages provide OpenStack Volume (Cinder), which
  provides services to manage and access block storage volumes for use by
  virtual machine instances.

  It was found that the fixes for CVE-2013-1664 and CVE-2013-1665, released
  via RHSA-2013:0658, did not fully correct the issues in the Extensible
  Markup Language (XML) parser used by Cinder. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to a Cinder API, causing
  Cinder to consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory, or possibly crash.
  (CVE-2013-4202)

  A bug in the Cinder LVM driver prevented LVM snapshots from being securely
  deleted in some cases, potentially leading to information disclosure to
  other tenants. (CVE-2013-4183)

  The CVE-2013-4202 issue was discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team.

  Additionally, openstack-cinder has been rebased to the latest Grizzly
  stable release 2013.1.3. (BZ#993094)

  All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Cinder running services will be restarted automatically.
