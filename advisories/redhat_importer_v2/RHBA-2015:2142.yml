  - CVE-2015-2327
summary: "Updated pcre packages that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 7.\n\nPCRE is a Perl-compatible regular expression library. \n\nThis update fixes\
  \ the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, non-matched groups within capturing groups up to a\
  \ forced match were not being properly reset by PCRE, causing the library to incorrectly match\
  \ some groups. With this update, non-matched groups within capturing groups up to a forced\
  \ match are being properly marked as non-matching. (BZ#1161597)\n\n* Compiling zero-repeated\
  \ groups with recursive back references no longer causes PCRE to crash. (BZ#1119356)\n\n*\
  \ A bug in PCRE was causing it to match the wrong substring in regular expressions with empty-matching\
  \ possessive zero-repeat groups. This problem has been fixed and matching these groups now\
  \ behaves as expected. (BZ#1119320)\n\n* PCRE previously did not correctly evaluate regular\
  \ expressions with literal quotations inside character class. For example, the expression\
  \ \"/[\\Qa]\\E]+/\" was not matching the string \"a\", although it should. The problem has\
  \ been fixed and regular expressions with literal quotations inside character class are now\
  \ being evaluated correctly. (BZ#1111091)\n\n* An error in first character optimization was\
  \ causing PCRE to incorrectly evaluate regular expressions where a start-anchored character\
  \ with more than once case follows circumflex in multi-line UTF-8 mode. This update resolves\
  \ the problem and PCRE now properly evaluates these regular expressions. (BZ#1110621)\n\n\
  * Linking an application to the static PCRE library using the libpcre module for pkg-config\
  \ was failing due to missing pthread symbols. The pkg-config modules for PCRE libraries have\
  \ been updated to declare private libraries properly, and the \"pkg-config --static --libs\
  \ libpcre\" command can now be used to link the static pcre library to an application. (BZ#1217111)\n\
  \n* The pcredemo.c file, which is described in the pcresample(3) man page as containing code\
  \ examples for PCRE, was missing from the pcre-devel package. The example file has been added\
  \ to the pcre-devel package and can now be found in the /usr/share/doc/pcre-devel-8.32/ directory.\
  \ (BZ#1217118)\n\nUsers of pcre are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix\
  \ these bugs."
