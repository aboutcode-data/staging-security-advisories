summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A memory corruption flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded certain
  PNG images. An attacker could create a mail message containing a
  specially-crafted PNG image that, when opened, could cause Thunderbird to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-1205)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML mail content.
  An HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-0174, CVE-2010-1200, CVE-2010-1211,
  CVE-2010-1214, CVE-2010-2753)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the processing of malformed HTML mail
  content. An HTML mail message containing malicious content could cause
  Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-1199)

  Several use-after-free flaws were found in Thunderbird. Viewing an HTML
  mail message containing malicious content could result in Thunderbird
  executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-0175, CVE-2010-0176, CVE-2010-0177)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird plug-ins interact. It was possible
  for a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in,
  resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-1198)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled the "Content-Disposition:
  attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
  also present. Loading remote HTTP content that allows arbitrary uploads and
  relies on the "Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent
  content from being displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve
  malicious content to users. (CVE-2010-1197)

  A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Thunderbird. Remote HTML
  content could steal private data from different remote HTML content
  Thunderbird has loaded. (CVE-2010-2754)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
