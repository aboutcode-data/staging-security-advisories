  - CVE-2008-0072
summary: |
  Updated evolution packages that fix a format string bug are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Evolution is the GNOME collection of personal information management (PIM)
  tools.

  A format string flaw was found in the way Evolution displayed encrypted
  mail content. If a user opened a carefully crafted mail message, arbitrary
  code could be executed as the user running Evolution. (CVE-2008-0072)

  All users of Evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch which resolves this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank Ulf Härnhammar of Secunia Research for finding
  and reporting this issue.
