summary: |
  Updated wireshark packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer,
  which is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer
  network.

  Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
  crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
  opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2014-8714, CVE-2014-8712, CVE-2014-8713,
  CVE-2014-8711, CVE-2014-8710, CVE-2015-0562, CVE-2015-0564, CVE-2015-2189,
  CVE-2015-2191)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the Wireshark tool did not support Advanced Encryption
  Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) cryptographic algorithm. As a
  consequence, AES-GCM was not decrypted. Support for AES-GCM has been added
  to Wireshark, and AES-GCM is now correctly decrypted. (BZ#1095065)

  * Previously, when installing the system using the kickstart method, a
  dependency on the shadow-utils packages was missing from the wireshark
  packages, which could cause the installation to fail with a "bad scriptlet"
  error message. With this update, shadow-utils are listed as required in the
  wireshark packages spec file, and kickstart installation no longer fails.
  (BZ#1121275)

  * Prior to this update, the Wireshark tool could not decode types of
  elliptic curves in Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Client Hello.
  Consequently, Wireshark incorrectly displayed elliptic curves types as
  data. A patch has been applied to address this bug, and Wireshark now
  decodes elliptic curves types properly. (BZ#1131203)

  * Previously, a dependency on the gtk2 packages was missing from the
  wireshark packages. As a consequence, the Wireshark tool failed to start
  under certain circumstances due to an unresolved symbol,
  "gtk_combo_box_text_new_with_entry", which was added in gtk version 2.24.
  With this update, a dependency on gtk2 has been added, and Wireshark now
  always starts as expected. (BZ#1160388)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * With this update, the Wireshark tool supports process substitution, which
  feeds the output of a process (or processes) into the standard input of
  another process using the "<(command_list)" syntax. When using process
  substitution with large files as input, Wireshark failed to decode such
  input. (BZ#1104210)

  * Wireshark has been enhanced to enable capturing packets with nanosecond
  time stamp precision, which allows better analysis of recorded network
  traffic. (BZ#1146578)

  All wireshark users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements. All running instances of Wireshark must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
