summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  A heap overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM emulated the e1000
  network interface card. A privileged guest user in a virtual machine whose
  network interface is configured to use the e1000 emulated driver could use
  this flaw to crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
  host. (CVE-2012-0029)

  A flaw was found in the way the KVM subsystem of a Linux kernel handled PIT
  (Programmable Interval Timer) IRQs (interrupt requests) when there was no
  virtual interrupt controller set up. A malicious user in the kvm group on
  the host could force this situation to occur, resulting in the host
  crashing. (CVE-2011-4622)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nicolae Mogoreanu for reporting CVE-2012-0029.

  All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in the
  Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.
