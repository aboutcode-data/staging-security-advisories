  - CVE-2008-6123
summary: |
  Updated net-snmp packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol used for
  network management.

  It was discovered that the snmpd daemon did not use TCP wrappers correctly,
  causing network hosts access restrictions defined in "/etc/hosts.allow" and
  "/etc/hosts.deny" to not be honored. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2008-6123)

  This issue only affected configurations where hosts.allow and hosts.deny
  were used to limit access to the SNMP server. To obtain information from
  the server, the attacker would have to successfully authenticate, usually
  by providing a correct community string.

  All net-snmp users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the update, the
  snmpd and snmptrapd daemons will be restarted automatically.
