  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.1 serves as a replacement for
  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.0. It includes various bug fixes and
  enhancements which are detailed in the Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.1
  Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  It was found that when Tomcat processed a series of HTTP requests in which
  at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or
  one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat
  would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or
  obtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.1.
