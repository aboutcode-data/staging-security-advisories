  - CVE-2007-0010
summary: |
  Updated gtk2 packages that fix a security issue are now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The gtk2 package contains the GIMP ToolKit (GTK+), a library for creating
  graphical user interfaces for the X Window System.

  A bug was found in the way the gtk2 GdkPixbufLoader() function processed
  invalid input.   Applications linked against gtk2 could crash if they
  loaded a malformed image file. (CVE-2007-0010)

  Users of gtk2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
