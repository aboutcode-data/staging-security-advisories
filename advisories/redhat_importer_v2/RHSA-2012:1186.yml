  - CVE-2012-3503
summary: |
  Updated katello packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat CloudForms.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Katello allows you to manage the application life-cycle for Linux systems.
  Katello is used by CloudForms System Engine, an Infrastructure as a Service
  (IaaS) application that provides tools to update and monitor systems within
  private and hybrid clouds, and can be used to configure new systems,
  subscribe to updates, and maintain installations in distributed
  environments.

  It was found that the katello-common package's installation script did not
  correctly generate the secret token used for session cookie generation,
  leading to every default installation using the same secret token. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to create a cookie that would allow them to
  log into the CloudForms System Engine web interface as any user, without
  knowing the passwords. (CVE-2012-3503)

  All users of Red Hat CloudForms are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. For instructions on applying this
  update, refer to the CloudForms Release Notes, linked to in the References
  section.
