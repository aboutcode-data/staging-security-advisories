summary: |
  An updated foomatic package that fixes three security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which
  give detailed severity ratings, are available from the CVE links in the
  References section.

  Foomatic is a comprehensive, spooler-independent database of printers,
  printer drivers, and driver descriptions. The package also includes
  spooler-independent command line interfaces to manipulate queues and to
  print files and manipulate print jobs.

  It was discovered that the unhtmlify() function of foomatic-rip did not
  correctly calculate buffer sizes, possibly leading to a heap-based memory
  corruption. A malicious attacker could exploit this flaw to cause
  foomatic-rip to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2010-5325)

  It was discovered that foomatic-rip failed to remove all shell special
  characters from inputs used to construct command lines for external
  programs run by the filter. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  execute arbitrary commands. (CVE-2015-8327, CVE-2015-8560)

  All foomatic users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to correct these issues.
