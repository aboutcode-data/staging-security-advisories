summary: |
  An update for qemu-kvm is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM.

  Security Fix(es):

  * QEMU: slirp: heap buffer overflow while reassembling fragmented datagrams (CVE-2018-11806)

  * QEMU: i386: multiboot OOB access while loading kernel image (CVE-2018-7550)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jskz - Zero Day Initiative (trendmicro.com) for reporting CVE-2018-11806 and Cyrille Chatras (Orange.com) and CERT-CC (Orange.com) for reporting CVE-2018-7550.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, live migrating a Windows guest in some cases caused the guest to become unresponsive. This update ensures that Real-time Clock (RTC) interrupts are not missed, which prevents the problem from occurring. (BZ#1596302)
