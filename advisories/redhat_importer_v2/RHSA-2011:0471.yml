summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0080,
  CVE-2011-0081)

  An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
  out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
  malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
  with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0078)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
  frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
  the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
  to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-0077)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
  with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
  trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0075)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
  malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0074)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
  Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0073)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
  iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
  Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0072)

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
  handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
  accessible to the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0071)

  A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
  "application/http-index-format" documents. A malformed HTTP response could
  cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0070)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
  requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
  JavaScript requests, it could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2011-0069)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the autocomplete pop-up.
  Malicious content could use this flaw to steal form history information.
  (CVE-2011-0067)

  Two use-after-free flaws were found in the Firefox mObserverList and
  mChannel objects. Malicious content could use these flaws to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2011-0066, CVE-2011-0065)

  A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function
  returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be
  used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.
  (CVE-2011-1202)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 3.6.17. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 3.6.17, which corrects these issues. After installing the
  update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
