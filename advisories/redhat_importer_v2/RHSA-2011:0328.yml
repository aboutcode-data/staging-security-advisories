  - CVE-2011-0715
summary: |
  Updated subversion packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one
  or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of
  files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The
  mod_dav_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access to
  Subversion repositories via HTTP.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_dav_svn module
  processed certain requests to lock working copy paths in a repository. A
  remote attacker could issue a lock request that could cause the httpd
  process serving the request to crash. (CVE-2011-0715)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hyrum Wright of the Apache Subversion project
  for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Philip Martin, WANdisco,
  Inc. as the original reporter.

  All Subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, you must restart the httpd daemon, if you are using
  mod_dav_svn, for the update to take effect.
