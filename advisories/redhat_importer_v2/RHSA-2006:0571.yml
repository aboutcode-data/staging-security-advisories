  - CVE-2006-3082
summary: |
  An updated GnuPG package that fixes a security issue is now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in GnuPG.  An attacker could create a
  carefully crafted message packet with a large length that could cause GnuPG
  to crash or possibly overwrite memory when opened. (CVE-2006-3082)

  All users of GnuPG are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
