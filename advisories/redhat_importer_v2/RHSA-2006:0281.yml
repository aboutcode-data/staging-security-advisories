summary: "An updated Struts package that fixes several security issues is now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Application Server.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nStruts is a framework for building web applications\
  \ with Java.\n\nA validation bug was found in the way Struts handles\norg.apache.struts.taglib.html.Constants.CANCEL\
  \ requests. If it is possible\nfor a remote attacker to inject a CANCEL request during a validation\n\
  operation, it may be possible for the attacker to acquire credentials\nwithout the proper\
  \ authentication information. (CVE-2006-1546)\n\nA denial of service bug was found in the\
  \ way Struts handles\nmultipart/form-data encoded form data. If it is possible for a remote\n\
  attacker to reference the public getMultipartRequestHandler method, the\nattacker can prevent\
  \ the Struts application from functioning properly.\n(CVE-2006-1547)\n\nA cross site scripting\
  \ bug was found in the way Struts displays certain\nerror messages via its LookupDispatchAction,\
  \ DispatchAction, and\nActionDispatcher handler. It may be possible for an attacker to construct\
  \ a\nspecially crafted URL that could fool a victim into believing they are\nviewing a trusted\
  \ site. (CVE-2006-1548)\n\nAll users of Struts should upgrade to this updated package containing\
  \ \nStruts version 1.2.9, which is not vulnerable to these issues."
