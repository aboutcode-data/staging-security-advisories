  - CVE-2014-0022
summary: |
  An updated yum-updatesd package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The yum-updatesd package provides a daemon which checks for available
  updates and can notify you when they are available via email, syslog,
  or dbus.

  It was discovered that yum-updatesd did not properly perform RPM package
  signature checks. When yum-updatesd was configured to automatically install
  updates, a remote attacker could use this flaw to install a malicious
  update on the target system using an unsigned RPM or an RPM signed with an
  untrusted key. (CVE-2014-0022)

  All yum-updatesd users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, the yum-updatesd service will be restarted automatically.
