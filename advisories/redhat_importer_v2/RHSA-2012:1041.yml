summary: |
  Updated redhat-ds-base packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Directory Server 8.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Directory Server handled password
  changes. If an LDAP user had changed their password, and the directory
  server had not been restarted since that change, an attacker able to bind
  to the directory server could obtain the plain text version of that user's
  password via the "unhashed#user#password" attribute. (CVE-2012-2678)

  It was found that when the password for an LDAP user was changed, and audit
  logging was enabled (it is disabled by default), the new password was
  written to the audit log in plain text form. This update introduces a new
  configuration parameter, "nsslapd-auditlog-logging-hide-unhashed-pw", which
  when set to "on" (the default option), prevents Red Hat Directory Server
  from writing plain text passwords to the audit log. This option can be
  configured in "/etc/dirsrv/slapd-[ID]/dse.ldif". (CVE-2012-2746)

  All users of Red Hat Directory Server 8 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which resolve these issues. After installing this update,
  the dirsrv service will be restarted automatically.
