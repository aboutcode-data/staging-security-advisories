summary: |
  Updated versions of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are available to fix a
  number of vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, Apache, PHP, and Tomcat.

  Also included in this update are bug fixes for mod_proxy and the
  mod_authz_ldap package.

  Stronghold 4 cross platform contains a number of open source technologies
  such as OpenSSL, Apache, and PHP. A number of issues have been found in
  versions of these projects:

  In a paper, Brice Canvel, Alain Hiltgen, Serge Vaudenay, and Martin
  Vuagnoux describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC ciphersuites
  in SSL and TLS. An active attacker may be able to use timing observations
  to distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and
  MAC verification errors. Over multiple connections this can leak
  sufficient information to be able to retrieve the plain text of a common,
  fixed block. In order for an attack to be successful an attacker must be
  able to act as a man-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple
  connections which all involve a common fixed plain text block (such as a
  password), and have good network conditions that allow small changes in
  timing to be reliably observed.

  The Apache Web server does not prevent escape sequences from being written
  to the error log. This could allow an attacker to embed arbitrary escape
  sequences into the log file. A recent paper by HD Moore highlighted
  several issues where common terminal emulator software (such as xterm) can
  be remotely abused or exploited by displaying arbitrary escape sequences.

  The MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) used in the PHP MySQL extension
  in PHP versions earlier than 4.3.0 does not properly verify length fields
  for certain responses in the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which
  allows a malicious server to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
  arbitrary code.

  A source code exposure vulnerability has been found that affects Tomcat
  versions 4.0.0 through 4.0.5 and 4.1.0 through 4.1.12, in a variant of
  the issue addressed in RHSA-2002:217. Using a carefully crafted request, a
  remote attacker can read the source code of any deployed JSP file.

  In addition to the security fixes, two bug fixes have also been applied:

  If Apache is configured to act as a reverse proxy by specifying the backend
  server using a numeric IP address, the mod_proxy module will perform a
  redundant reverse DNS lookup on the IP address, causing a delay in request
  processing.

  A bug in mod_authz_ldap version 0.21 and earlier prevent
  authentication being performed by other Apache modules (such as
  filed-based authentication using mod_auth) when the mod_authz_ldap module
  is loaded.

  Stronghold 4 cross platform contains OpenSSL 0.9.6c, Apache 1.3.22, PHP
  4.1.2, Tomcat 4.0.5, and mod_authz_ldap 0.19, and is therefore vulnerable
  to these issues. Users of Stronghold are advised to update to the errata
  versions of Stronghold 4 which contain backported security fixes and are
  not vulnerable to these issues.
