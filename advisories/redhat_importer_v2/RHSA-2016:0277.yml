  - CVE-2015-7547
summary: |
  Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix one security issue are now
  available.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the libresolv library
  performed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could create a
  specially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or,
  potentially, execute code with the permissions of the user running the
  library. Note: this issue is only exposed when libresolv is called from the
  nss_dns NSS service module. (CVE-2015-7547)

  This issue was discovered by the Google Security Team and Red Hat.

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages.
