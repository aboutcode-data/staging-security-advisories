summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2, which fixes two security
  issues, various bugs, and adds several enhancements is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
  which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam. OpenID4Java allows you to implement OpenID authentication in
  your Java applications. OpenID4Java is a Technology Preview.

  This JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 release serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1, and includes
  bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 5.1.2 Release Notes for information on the most significant of
  these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the invoker servlets, deployed by default via
  httpha-invoker, only performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST
  methods, allowing remote attackers to make unauthenticated requests by
  using different HTTP methods. Due to the second layer of authentication
  provided by a security interceptor, this issue is not exploitable on
  default installations unless an administrator has misconfigured the
  security interceptor or disabled it. (CVE-2011-4085)

  It was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was
  not checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to
  receive information that an application only trusts the identity provider
  to assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
  man-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information
  via a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid
  example application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up the
  "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory and any other customized
  configuration files of your JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 5.1.2.
