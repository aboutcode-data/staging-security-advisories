summary: |
  An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way BIND handled TSIG authentication for dynamic updates. A remote attacker able to communicate with an authoritative BIND server could use this flaw to manipulate the contents of a zone, by forging a valid TSIG or SIG(0) signature for a dynamic update request. (CVE-2017-3143)

  * A flaw was found in the way BIND handled TSIG authentication of AXFR requests. A remote attacker, able to communicate with an authoritative BIND server, could use this flaw to view the entire contents of a zone by sending a specially constructed request packet. (CVE-2017-3142)

  Red Hat would like to thank Internet Systems Consortium for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Clement Berthaux (Synacktiv) as the original reporter of these issues.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * ICANN is planning to perform a Root Zone DNSSEC Key Signing Key (KSK) rollover during October 2017. Maintaining an up-to-date KSK, by adding the new root zone KSK, is essential for ensuring that validating DNS resolvers continue to function following the rollover. (BZ#1459649)
