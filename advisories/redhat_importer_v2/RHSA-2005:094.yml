summary: |
  An updated Thunderbird package that fixes a security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled synthetic middle click events.
  It is possible for a malicious web page to steal the contents of a victim's
  clipboard. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2005-0146 to this issue.

  A bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled cookies when loading content
  over HTTP regardless of the user's preference. It is possible that a
  particular user could be tracked through the use of malicious mail messages
  which load content over HTTP. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0149 to this issue.

  Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains Thunderbird version 1.0 and is not vulnerable to this issue.
