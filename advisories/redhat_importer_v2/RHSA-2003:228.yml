aliases:
  - CVE-2002-0871
  - CVE-2003-0211
summary: |
  Updated xinetd packages for  Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries
  systems that fix a security vulnerability and two denial of service
  vulnerabilities are now avaliable.

  Xinetd is a 'master server' that is used to to accept service connection
  requests and start the appropriate servers.

  Versions of Xinetd prior to 2.3.7 leak file descriptors for the signal
  pipe to services that are launched by xinetd. This could allow an attacker
  to execute a DoS attack via the pipe. This issue is entered in the Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project with the name CVE-2002-0871.

  Because of a programming error, memory was allocated and never freed if a
  connection was refused for any reason.  An attacker could exploit this flaw
  to crash the xinetd server, rendering all services it controls unavaliable.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0211 to this issue.

  In addition, other flaws in xinetd could cause incorrect operation in
  certain unusual server configurations.

  All users of xinetd are advised to update to the packages listed in this
  erratum, which contain an upgrade to xinetd-2.3.11 and are not vulnerable
  to these issues.
