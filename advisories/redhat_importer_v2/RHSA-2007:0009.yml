  - CVE-2006-5330
summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes a security issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Firefox-compatible Adobe Flash Player
  browser plug-in.

  A flaw was found in the way the Adobe Flash Player generates HTTP requests.
  It was possible for a malicious Adobe Flash file to modify the HTTP header
  of the client request, which could be leveraged to exploit certain HTTP proxy
  and web server flaws. (CVE-2006-5330)

  Users of Adobe Flash Player should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains version 7.0.69 and is not vulnerable to this issue.
