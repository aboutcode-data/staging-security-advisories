summary: "Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue are now available \nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important\
  \ security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives\
  \ a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nThe 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages\ninclude the Lightweight\
  \ Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and\ncommand-line utilities for server administration.\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the way Red Hat Directory Server performed\nauthorization of modrdn\
  \ operations. An unauthenticated attacker able to\nissue an ldapmodrdn call to the directory\
  \ server could use this flaw to\nperform unauthorized modifications of entries in the directory\
  \ server.\n(CVE-2015-1854)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Simo Sorce of Red Hat.\n\nAll 389-ds-base\
  \ users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain a backported patch\
  \ to correct this issue. After installing\nthis update, the 389 server service will be restarted\
  \ automatically."
