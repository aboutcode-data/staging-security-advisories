  - CVE-2013-2172
summary: |
  An updated xml-security package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Apache Santuario implements the XML Signature Syntax and Processing and XML
  Encryption Syntax and Processing standards.

  A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
  validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
  arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
  SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
  XML signature via a specially-crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
  and configuration files).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
