summary: |
  An update for the Apache HTTP Server packages for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.2 that fixes two security issues are now available
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the mod_dav module did not correctly strip leading white
  space from certain elements in a parsed XML. In certain httpd
  configurations that use the mod_dav module (for example when using the
  mod_dav_svn module), a remote attacker could send a specially crafted DAV
  request that would cause the httpd child process to crash or, possibly,
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  "apache" user. (CVE-2013-6438)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd mod_log_config module.
  In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote attacker could
  use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP request with a
  malformed cookie header. (CVE-2014-0098)

  All users of the httpd packages for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.2 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to
  apply this update. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
