  - CVE-2012-5629
summary: |
  Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 packages that fix one
  security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications
  based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  When using LDAP authentication with either the "ldap" configuration entry
  or the provided LDAP login modules (LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule),
  empty passwords were allowed by default. An attacker could use this flaw to
  bypass intended authentication by providing an empty password for a valid
  username, as the LDAP server may recognize this as an 'unauthenticated
  authentication' (RFC 4513). This update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option
  for the LDAP login modules to false if the option is not already
  configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

  Note: If you are using the "ldap" configuration entry and rely on empty
  passwords, they will no longer work after applying this update. The
  jboss-as-domain-management module, by default, will prevent empty
  passwords. This cannot be configured; however, a future release may add a
  configuration option to allow empty passwords when using the "ldap"
  configuration entry.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
