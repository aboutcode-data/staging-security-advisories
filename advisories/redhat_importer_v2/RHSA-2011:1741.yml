  - CVE-2011-1072
summary: |
  An updated php-pear package that fixes one security issue and multiple bugs
  is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The php-pear package contains the PHP Extension and Application Repository
  (PEAR), a framework and distribution system for reusable PHP components.

  It was found that the "pear" command created temporary files in an insecure
  way when installing packages. A malicious, local user could use this flaw
  to conduct a symbolic link attack, allowing them to overwrite the contents
  of arbitrary files accessible to the victim running the "pear install"
  command. (CVE-2011-1072)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The php-pear package has been upgraded to version 1.9.4, which provides a
  number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#651897)

  * Prior to this update, php-pear created a cache in the
  "/var/cache/php-pear/" directory when attempting to list all packages. As a
  consequence, php-pear failed to create or update the cache file as a
  regular user without sufficient file permissions and could not list all
  packages. With this update, php-pear no longer fails if writing to the
  cache directory is not permitted. Now, all packages are listed as expected.
  (BZ#747361)

  All users of php-pear are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects these issues.
