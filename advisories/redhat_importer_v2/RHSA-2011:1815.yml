  - CVE-2011-4599
summary: |
  Updated icu packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The International Components for Unicode (ICU) library provides robust and
  full-featured Unicode services.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ICU performed
  variant canonicalization for some locale identifiers. If a
  specially-crafted locale representation was opened in an application
  linked against ICU, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2011-4599)

  All users of ICU should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. All applications linked against
  ICU must be restarted for this update to take effect.
