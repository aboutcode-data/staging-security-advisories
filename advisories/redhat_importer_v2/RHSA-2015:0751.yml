aliases:
  - CVE-2014-8159
  - CVE-2015-1421
summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix two security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not
  properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from
  user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a
  /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,
  Important)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP
  implementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT
  collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,
  Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting the CVE-2014-8159 issue.
  The CVE-2015-1421 issue was discovered by Sun Baoliang of Red Hat.

  The MRG-Realtime 3.10 kernel-rt sources have been updated to include the
  following bug fixes:

  * The kdump service could become unresponsive due to a deadlock in the
  kernel call ioapic_lock.

  * Attempt to make metadata changes such as creating a thin device or
  snapshot thin device did not error out cleanly.

  (BZ#1201384)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The MRG kernel scheduler code was missing checks for the PREEMPT_LAZY
  flag allowing tasks to be preempted more times than necessary causing
  latency spikes on the system. Additional checks for the PREEMPT_LAZY flag
  were added to the check_preempt_wakeup() and check_preempt_curr() functions
  in the scheduler code so that preempt wakeups were reduced and these
  latency spikes were removed. (BZ#1157949)

  All kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this update to take
  effect.
