  - CVE-2017-14491
summary: |
  An update for dnsmasq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Extended Lifecycle Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The dnsmasq packages contain Dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS (Domain Name Server) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A heap buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the code responsible for building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)

  Red Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), and Ron Bowes (Google Security Team) for reporting this issue.
