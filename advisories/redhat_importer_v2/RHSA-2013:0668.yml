  - CVE-2012-2677
summary: |
  Updated boost packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The boost packages provide free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
  libraries with emphasis on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
  Library.

  A flaw was found in the way the ordered_malloc() routine in Boost sanitized
  the 'next_size' and 'max_size' parameters when allocating memory. If an
  application used the Boost C++ libraries for memory allocation, and
  performed memory allocation based on user-supplied input, an attacker could
  use this flaw to crash the application or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2012-2677)

  All users of boost are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to fix this issue.
