summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.

  This release provides an update to OpenSSL and Tomcat 6/7 for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2. The updates are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

  Users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve several security issues.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)

  * A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)

  * A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.
