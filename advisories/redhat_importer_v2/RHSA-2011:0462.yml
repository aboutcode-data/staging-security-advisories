summary: |
  An updated jboss-seam.jar file for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  4.3.0.CP09 and 5.1.0 that fixes one security issue is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The JBoss Seam 2 framework is an application framework for building web
  applications in Java.

  It was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss
  Expression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing
  arbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to
  certain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly
  configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of
  this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)

  Red Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting
  this issue.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0.CP09 and 5.1.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this
  update.
