  - CVE-2003-0686
summary: "Updated pam_smb packages are now available which fix a security\nvulnerability (buffer\
  \ overflow).\n\nThe pam_smb module is a pluggable authentication module (PAM) used to\nauthenticate\
  \ users using an external Server Message Block (SMB) server.\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability\
  \ has been found that affects unpatched\nversions of pam_smb up to and including 1.1.6. \n\
  \nOn systems that use pam_smb and are configured to authenticate a\nremotely accessible service,\
  \ an attacker can exploit this bug and\nremotely execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0686 to this issue.\n\
  \nRed Hat Linux versions 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, and 9 ship with versions of pam_smb\nthat are vulnerable\
  \ to this issue, however pam_smb is not enabled by default.\n\nUsers of pam_smb are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a patch to version 1.1.6 to correct\
  \ this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Dave Airlie of the Samba team for notifying us\n\
  of this issue."
