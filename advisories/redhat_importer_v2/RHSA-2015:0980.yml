aliases:
  - CVE-2015-1848
  - CVE-2015-3983
summary: |
  Updated pcs packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The pcs packages provide a command-line tool and a web UI to configure and
  manage the Pacemaker and Corosync tools.

  It was found that the pcs daemon did not sign cookies containing session
  data that were sent to clients connecting via the pcsd web UI. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to forge cookies and bypass authorization
  checks, possibly gaining elevated privileges in the pcsd web UI.
  (CVE-2015-1848)

  This issue was discovered by Tomas Jelinek of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, the Corosync tool allowed the two_node option and the
  auto_tie_breaker option to exist in the corosync.conf file at the same
  time. As a consequence, if both options were included, auto_tie_breaker was
  silently ignored and the two_node fence race decided which node would
  survive in the event of a communication break. With this update, the pcs
  daemon has been fixed so that it does not produce corosync.conf files with
  both two_node and auto_tie_breaker included. In addition, if both two_node
  and auto_tie_breaker are detected in corosync.conf, Corosync issues a
  message at start-up and disables two_node mode. As a result,
  auto_tie_breaker effectively overrides two_node mode if both options are
  specified. (BZ#1205848)

  All pcs users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the pcsd daemon will be restarted automatically.
