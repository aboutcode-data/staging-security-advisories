  - CVE-2009-2698
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  These updated packages fix the following security issues:

  * a flaw was found in the SOCKOPS_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This
  macro did not initialize the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure
  correctly. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local
  denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2692, Important)

  * a flaw was found in the udp_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel
  when using the MSG_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2009-2698, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google
  Security Team for responsibly reporting these flaws.

  All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to resolve these issues. The
  system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
