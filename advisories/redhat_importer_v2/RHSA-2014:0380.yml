  Two flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content.
  An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted SWF file
  that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF content.
  (CVE-2014-0506, CVE-2014-0507)

  A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive
  information if a victim were tricked into visiting a specially crafted web
  page. (CVE-2014-0508)

  scripting (XSS) attacks if a victim were tricked into visiting a specially
  crafted web page. (CVE-2014-0509)
