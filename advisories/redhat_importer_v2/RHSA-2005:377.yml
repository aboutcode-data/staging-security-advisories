summary: |
  An updated sharutils package is now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The sharutils package contains a set of tools for encoding and decoding
  packages of files in binary or text format.

  A stack based overflow bug was found in the way shar handles the -o option.
  If a user can be tricked into running a specially crafted command, it could
  lead to arbitrary code execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1772 to this issue.
  Please note that this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  Two buffer overflow bugs were found in sharutils. If an attacker can place
  a malicious 'wc' command on a victim's machine, or trick a victim into
  running a specially crafted command, it could lead to arbitrary code
  execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1773 to this issue.

  A bug was found in the way unshar creates temporary files. A local user
  could use symlinks to overwrite arbitrary files the victim running unshar
  has write access to. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0990 to this issue.

  All users of sharutils should upgrade to this updated package, which
  includes backported fixes to correct these issues.
