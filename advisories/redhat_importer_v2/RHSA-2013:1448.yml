summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2 that fixes multiple
  security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that
  provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss
  Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  A flaw was found in the way the DiskFileItem class handled NULL characters
  in file names. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized instance of
  the DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a server, could use
  this flaw to write arbitrary content to any location on the server that is
  accessible to the user running the application server process.
  (CVE-2013-2186)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of the
  org.jboss.remoting.transport.socket.ServerThread class in JBoss
  Remoting. An attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available file
  descriptors on the target server, preventing legitimate connections. Note
  that to exploit this flaw remotely, the remoting port must be exposed
  directly or indirectly (for example, deploying a public facing application
  that uses JBoss Remoting could indirectly expose this flaw).
  (CVE-2013-4210)

  It was found that the JBoss Operations Network server exposed configured
  passwords in plain text in its log files by default. A local user with
  access to these log files could use the exposed credentials.
  (CVE-2013-4293)

  A flaw was found in the way JPADriftServerBean instances stored drift
  files. The storeFiles method created a predictable temporary directory when
  unpacking a zip file. Once a zip file was extracted to the temporary
  directory, all files in this directory were stored. A local attacker could
  provide their own drift files to be imported into the server instance.
  (CVE-2013-4373)

  The CVE-2013-4293 was discovered by Larry O'Leary of the Red Hat Middleware
  Support Engineering Group, and CVE-2013-4210 was discovered by James
  Livingston of the Red Hat Support Engineering Group.

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
