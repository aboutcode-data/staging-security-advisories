  - CVE-2007-3257
summary: |
  Updated evolution packages that fix a security bug are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Evolution is the GNOME collection of personal information management (PIM)
  tools.

  A flaw was found in the way Evolution processes certain IMAP server
  messages. If a user can be tricked into connecting to a malicious IMAP
  server it may be possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running
  evolution. (CVE-2007-3257)

  All users of Evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch which resolves this issue.
