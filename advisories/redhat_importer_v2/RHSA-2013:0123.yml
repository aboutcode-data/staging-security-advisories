  - CVE-2011-4339
summary: |
  Updated OpenIPMI packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and
  add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The OpenIPMI packages provide command line tools and utilities to access
  platform information using Intelligent Platform Management Interface
  (IPMI). System administrators can use OpenIPMI to manage systems and to
  perform system health monitoring.

  It was discovered that the IPMI event daemon (ipmievd) created its process
  ID (PID) file with world-writable permissions. A local user could use this
  flaw to make the ipmievd init script kill an arbitrary process when the
  ipmievd daemon is stopped or restarted. (CVE-2011-4339)

  Note: This issue did not affect the default configuration of OpenIPMI as
  shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the ipmitool utility first checked the IPMI
  hardware for Dell IPMI extensions and listed only supported commands when
  printing command usage like the option "ipmtool delloem help". On a
  non-Dell platform, the usage text was incomplete and misleading. This
  update lists all Dell OEM extensions in usage texts on all platforms, which
  allows users to check for command line arguments on non-Dell hardware.
  (BZ#658762)

  * Prior to this update, the ipmitool utility tried to retrieve the Sensor
  Data Records (SDR) from the IPMI bus instead of the Baseboard Management
  Controller (BMC) bus when IPMI-enabled devices reported SDR under a
  different owner than the BMC. As a consequence, the timeout setting for the
  SDR read attempt could significantly decrease the performance and no sensor
  data was shown. This update modifies ipmitool to read these SDR records
  from the BMC and shows the correct sensor data on these platforms.
  (BZ#671059, BZ#749796)

  * Prior to this update, the exit code of the "ipmitool -o list" option was
  not set correctly. As a consequence, "ipmitool -o list" always returned the
  value 1 instead of the expected value 0. This update modifies the
  underlying code to return the value 0 as expected. (BZ#740780)

  * Prior to this update, the "ipmi" service init script did not specify the
  full path to the "/sbin/lsmod" and "/sbin/modprobe" system utilities. As a
  consequence, the init script failed when it was executed if PATH did not
  point to /sbin, for example, when running "sudo /etc/init.d/ipmi". This
  update modifies the init script so that it now contains the full path to
  lsmod and modrpobe. Now, it can be executed with sudo. (BZ#829705)

  * Prior to this update, the ipmitool man page did not list the "-b", "-B",
  "-l" and "-T" options. In this update, these options are documented in the
  ipmitool man page. (BZ#846596)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * Updates to the Dell-specific IPMI extension: A new vFlash command, which
  allows users to display information about extended SD cards; a new setled
  command, which allows users to display the backplane LED status; improved
  error descriptions; added support for new hardware; and updated
  documentation of the ipmitool delloem commands in the ipmitool manual
  page. (BZ#797050)

  All users of OpenIPMI are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement.
