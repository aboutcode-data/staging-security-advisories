summary: |
  Updated rabbitmq-server packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for
  RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  RabbitMQ is an implementation of AMQP, the emerging standard for high
  performance enterprise messaging. The RabbitMQ server is a robust and
  scalable implementation of an AMQP broker.

  A cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in RabbitMQ, which
  allowed using api/ path info to inject and receive data. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to create an "/api/..." URL, forcing a server error
  that resulted in the server returning an HTML page with embedded text from
  the URL (not escaped). (CVE-2014-9649)

  A response-splitting vulnerability was discovered in RabbitMQ.
  An /api/definitions URL could be specified, which then caused an arbitrary
  additional header to be returned. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  inject arbitrary HTTP headers and possibly gain access to secure data.
  (CVE-2014-9650)

  All rabbitmq-server users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
