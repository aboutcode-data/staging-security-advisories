  - CVE-2013-0791
  - CVE-2013-1620
summary: |
  Updated nss and nspr packages that fix two security issues, various bugs,
  and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform
  independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

  It was discovered that NSS leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
  padding oracle. (CVE-2013-1620)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way NSS decoded certain
  certificates. If an application using NSS decoded a malformed certificate,
  it could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2013-0791)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting
  CVE-2013-0791. Upstream acknowledges Ambroz Bizjak as the original reporter
  of CVE-2013-0791.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * A defect in the FreeBL library implementation of the Diffie-Hellman (DH)
  protocol previously caused Openswan to drop connections. (BZ#958023)

   * A memory leak in the nssutil_ReadSecmodDB() function has been fixed.
  (BZ#986969)

  In addition, the nss package has been upgraded to upstream version 3.14.3,
  and the nspr package has been upgraded to upstream version 4.9.5. These
  updates provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous
  versions. (BZ#949845, BZ#924741)

  Note that while upstream NSS version 3.14 prevents the use of certificates
  that have an MD5 signature, this erratum includes a patch that allows such
  certificates by default. To prevent the use of certificates that have an
  MD5 signature, set the "NSS_HASH_ALG_SUPPORT" environment variable
  to "-MD5".

  Users of NSS and NSPR are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which fix these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
  update, applications using NSS or NSPR must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
