  - CVE-2014-1544
summary: |
  Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform
  independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

  A race condition was found in the way NSS verified certain certificates.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using NSS or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  that application. (CVE-2014-1544)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber as the
  original reporters.

  All NSS users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, applications using NSS must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
