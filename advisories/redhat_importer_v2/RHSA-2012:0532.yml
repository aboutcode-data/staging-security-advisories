summary: "Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red \nHat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update\
  \ as having \nimportant security impact.\n\nNetwork Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries\
  \ designed to support\nthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server\n\
  applications.\n\nIt was found that a Certificate Authority (CA) issued fraudulent HTTPS\n\
  certificates. This update renders any HTTPS certificates signed by that CA\nas untrusted.\
  \ This covers all uses of the certificates, including SSL,\nS/MIME, and code signing. (BZ#734316)\n\
  \nNote: This fix only applies to applications using the NSS Builtin Object\nToken. It does\
  \ not render the certificates untrusted for applications that\nuse the NSS library, but do\
  \ not use the NSS Builtin Object Token.\n\nAll NSS users should upgrade to these updated packages,\
  \ which correct this\nissue. After installing the update, applications using NSS must be\n\
  restarted for the changes to take effect."
