  - CVE-2009-0578
summary: |
  Updated NetworkManager packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  NetworkManager is a network link manager that attempts to keep a wired or
  wireless network connection active at all times.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in NetworkManager's D-Bus
  interface. A local attacker could leverage this flaw to discover sensitive
  information, such as network connection passwords and pre-shared keys.
  (CVE-2009-0365)

  A potential denial of service flaw was found in NetworkManager's D-Bus
  interface. A local user could leverage this flaw to modify local connection
  settings, preventing the system's network connection from functioning
  properly. (CVE-2009-0578)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ludwig Nussel for reporting these flaws
  responsibly.

  Users of NetworkManager should upgrade to these updated packages which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
