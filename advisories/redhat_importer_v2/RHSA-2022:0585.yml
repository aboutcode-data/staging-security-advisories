  - CVE-2021-44716
summary: |
  An update for sg-core-container is now available for Service Telemetry Framework 1.4.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Service Telemetry Framework (STF) provides automated collection of measurements and data from remote clients, such as Red Hat OpenStack Platform or third-party nodes. STF then transmits the information to a centralized, receiving Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployment for storage, retrieval, and monitoring.

  Security fixes:

  * golang: net/http: limit growth of header canonicalization cache (CVE-2021-44716) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug fixes:

  * In some cases, Ceilometer metrics were not handled properly by sg-core. This resulted in some Ceilometer metrics not being stored in Prometheus. In this release, the processing of metrics has been enhanced to be more robust. While the sg-core has been enhanced to support larger messages from Ceilometer, an additional change is required to support passing the larger messages through the sg-bridge ring buffer. The changes required to fully support this functionality is being tracked in RHBZ#2053681. (BZ#2051615)
