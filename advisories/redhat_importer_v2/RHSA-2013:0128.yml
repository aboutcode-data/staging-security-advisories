  - CVE-2012-3359
summary: |
  Updated conga packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and add
  two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Conga project is a management system for remote workstations. It
  consists of luci, which is a secure web-based front end, and ricci, which
  is a secure daemon that dispatches incoming messages to underlying
  management modules.

  It was discovered that luci stored usernames and passwords in session
  cookies. This issue prevented the session inactivity timeout feature from
  working correctly, and allowed attackers able to get access to a session
  cookie to obtain the victim's authentication credentials. (CVE-2012-3359)

  Red Hat would like to thank George Hedfors of Cybercom Sweden East AB for
  reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, luci did not allow the fence_apc_snmp agent to be
  configured. As a consequence, users could not configure or view an existing
  configuration for fence_apc_snmp. This update adds a new screen that allows
  fence_apc_snmp to be configured. (BZ#832181)

  * Prior to this update, luci did not allow the SSL operation of the
  fence_ilo fence agent to be enabled or disabled. As a consequence, users
  could not configure or view an existing configuration for the 'ssl'
  attribute for fence_ilo. This update adds a checkbox to show whether the
  SSL operation is enabled and allows users to edit that attribute.
  (BZ#832183)

  * Prior to this update, luci did not allow the "identity_file" attribute of
  the fence_ilo_mp fence agent to be viewed or edited. As a consequence,
  users could not configure or view an existing configuration for the
  "identity_file" attribute of the fence_ilo_mp fence agent. This update adds
  a text input box to show the current state of the "identity_file" attribute
  of fence_ilo_mp and allows users to edit that attribute. (BZ#832185)

  * Prior to this update, redundant files and directories remained on the
  file system at /var/lib/luci/var/pts and /usr/lib{,64}/luci/zope/var/pts
  when the luci package was uninstalled. This update removes these files
  and directories when the luci package is uninstalled. (BZ#835649)

  * Prior to this update, the "restart-disable" recovery policy was not
  displayed in the recovery policy list from which users could select when
  they configure a recovery policy for a failover domain. As a consequence,
  the "restart-disable" recovery policy could not be set with the luci GUI.
  This update adds the "restart-disable" recovery option to the recovery
  policy pulldown list. (BZ#839732)

  * Prior to this update, line breaks that were not anticipated in the "yum
  list" output could cause package upgrade and/or installation to fail when
  creating clusters or adding nodes to existing clusters. As a consequence,
  creating clusters and adding cluster nodes to existing clusters could fail.
  This update modifies the ricci daemon to be able to correctly handle line
  breaks in the "yum list" output. (BZ#842865)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * This update adds support for configuring the Intel iPDU fence agent to
  the luci package. (BZ#741986)

  * This update adds support for viewing and changing the state of the new
  'nfsrestart' attribute to the FS and Cluster FS resource agent
  configuration screens. (BZ#822633)

  All users of conga are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
  update, the luci and ricci services will be restarted automatically.
