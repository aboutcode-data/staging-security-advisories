  - CVE-2011-3192
summary: |
  Updated httpd and httpd22 packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

  A flaw was found in the way the Apache HTTP Server handled Range HTTP
  headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the Apache HTTP
  Server to use an excessive amount of memory and CPU time via HTTP requests
  with a specially-crafted Range header. (CVE-2011-3192)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  After installing the updated packages, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users
  must restart the httpd22 service, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
  users must restart the httpd service, for the update to take effect.
