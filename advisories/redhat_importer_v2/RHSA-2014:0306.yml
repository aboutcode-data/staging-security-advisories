  - CVE-2014-0082
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-rubygem-actionpack packages that fix two security issues
  are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the
  view components.

  It was found that several number conversion helpers in Action View did not
  properly escape all their parameters. An attacker could use these flaws to
  perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
  data submitted by a user as parameters to the affected helpers.
  (CVE-2014-0081)

  A memory consumption issue was discovered in the text rendering component
  of Action View. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial
  of service attack by sending specially crafted queries that would result in
  the creation of Ruby symbols that were never garbage collected.
  (CVE-2014-0082)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Kevin Reintjes as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-0081, and Toby Hsieh of SlideShare as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-0082.

  All ruby193-rubygem-actionpack users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
