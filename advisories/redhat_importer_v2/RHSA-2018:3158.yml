  - CVE-2018-10852
summary: |
  An update for sssd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It also provides the Name Service Switch (NSS) and the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) interfaces toward the system, and a pluggable back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: sssd (1.16.2). (BZ#1558498)

  Security Fix(es):

  * sssd: information leak from the sssd-sudo responder (CVE-2018-10852)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  This issue was discovered by Jakub Hrozek (Red Hat).
