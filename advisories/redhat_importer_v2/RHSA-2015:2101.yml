summary: |
  Updated python packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
  often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme, or Java. Python includes modules,
  classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing.
  Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
  to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac and MFC).

  It was discovered that the Python xmlrpclib module did not restrict the
  size of gzip-compressed HTTP responses. A malicious XMLRPC server could
  cause an XMLRPC client using xmlrpclib to consume an excessive amount of
  memory. (CVE-2013-1753)

  It was discovered that multiple Python standard library modules
  implementing network protocols (such as httplib or smtplib) failed to
  restrict the sizes of server responses. A malicious server could cause a
  client using one of the affected modules to consume an excessive amount of
  memory. (CVE-2013-1752)

  It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module incorrectly handled URL
  encoded paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute scripts
  outside of the cgi-bin directory, or disclose the source code of the
  scripts in the cgi-bin directory. (CVE-2014-4650)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the buffer() function handled
  its offset and size arguments. An attacker able to control these arguments
  could use this flaw to disclose portions of the application memory or cause
  it to crash. (CVE-2014-7185)

  A flaw was found in the way the json module handled negative index
  arguments passed to certain functions (such as raw_decode()). An attacker
  able to control the index value passed to one of the affected functions
  could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the application
  memory. (CVE-2014-4616)

  The Python standard library HTTP client modules (such as httplib or urllib)
  did not perform verification of TLS/SSL certificates when connecting to
  HTTPS servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to hijack
  connections and eavesdrop or modify transferred data. (CVE-2014-9365)

  Note: The Python standard library was updated to make it possible to enable
  certificate verification by default. However, for backwards compatibility,
  verification remains disabled by default. Future updates may change this
  default. Refer to the Knowledgebase article 2039753 linked to in the
  References section for further details about this change. (BZ#1219108)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Subprocesses used with the Eventlet library or regular threads previously
  tried to close epoll file descriptors twice, which led to an "Invalid
  argument" error. Subprocesses have been fixed to close the file descriptors
  only once. (BZ#1103452)

  * When importing the readline module from a Python script, Python no longer
  produces erroneous random characters on stdout. (BZ#1189301)

  * The cProfile utility has been fixed to print all values that the "-s"
  option supports when this option is used without a correct value.
  (BZ#1237107)

  * The load_cert_chain() function now accepts "None" as a keyfile argument.
  (BZ#1250611)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * Security enhancements as described in PEP 466 have been backported to the
  Python standard library, for example, new features of the ssl module:
  Server Name Indication (SNI) support, support for new TLSv1.x protocols,
  new hash algorithms in the hashlib module, and many more. (BZ#1111461)

  * Support for the ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 protocol has been added to the ssl
  library. (BZ#1192015)

  * The ssl.SSLSocket.version() method is now available to access information
  about the version of the SSL protocol used in a connection. (BZ#1259421)

  All python users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
