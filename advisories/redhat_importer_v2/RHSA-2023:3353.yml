  Multicluster Engine for Kubernetes 2.0.9 images

  Multicluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components
  that are necessary for the centralized management of multiple
  Kubernetes-based clusters across data centers, public clouds, and private
  clouds.

  You can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
  clusters or to bring existing Kubernetes-based clusters under management by
  importing them. After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that
  are provided by the engine to distribute configuration based on placement
  policy.
