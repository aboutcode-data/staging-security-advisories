summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  Qemu emulator built with the RTL8139 emulation support is vulnerable to an
  information leakage flaw, while processing network packets under RTL8139
  controller's C+ mode of operation. A guest user could use this flaw to read
  upto 65KB of uninitialised Qemu heap memory. (CVE-2015-5165)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Donghai Zhu of Alibaba as the original reporter.

  All qemu-kvm-rhev users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual
  machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
