  - CVE-2014-3660
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation
  of various XML standards.

  A denial of service flaw was found in libxml2, a library providing support
  to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker could
  provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an application
  using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption (denial of service)
  based on excessive entity substitutions, even if entity substitution was
  disabled, which is the parser default behavior. (CVE-2014-3660)

  All libxml2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The desktop must be
  restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
