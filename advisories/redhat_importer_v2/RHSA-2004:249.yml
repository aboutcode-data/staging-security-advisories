  - CVE-2002-1363
summary: "Updated libpng packages that fix a possible buffer overflow are now available.\n\n\
  The libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable\
  \ Network Graphics) image format files.  \n\nDuring an audit of Red Hat Linux updates, the\
  \ Fedora Legacy team found a\nsecurity issue in libpng that had not been fixed in Red Hat\
  \ Enterprise\nLinux 3.  An attacker could carefully craft a PNG file in such a way that\n\
  it would cause an application linked to libpng to crash or potentially\nexecute arbitrary\
  \ code when opened by a victim.  \n\nNote: this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux\
  \ 2.1\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated packages that contain a\nbackported\
  \ security fix and are not vulnerable to this issue."
