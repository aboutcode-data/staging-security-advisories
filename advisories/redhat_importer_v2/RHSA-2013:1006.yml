summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1 roll up patch 2, which fixes multiple security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the
  management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss BRMS
  5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security
  issues are also fixed with this release:

  XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
  frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
  insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
  on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
  CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
  recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue affected both the
  JBoss Web Services CXF (jbossws-cxf) and JBoss Web Services Native
  (jbossws-native) stacks. (CVE-2012-5575)

  If you are using jbossws-cxf, then automatic checks to prevent this flaw
  are only run when WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security
  requirements. It is best practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce
  security requirements.

  If you are using jbossws-native, the fix for this flaw is implemented by
  two new configuration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element
  can be a child of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration
  descriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's
  jboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes
  are 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a
  blank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for
  the encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key
  wrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by
  default for empty lists or missing attributes.

  For example (do not include the line break in your configuration):

  encryption algorithms="aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm"
  keyWrapAlgorithms="rsa_oaep"

  Specifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the
  only permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and
  RSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.

  Before performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that
  each algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the
  allowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The
  algorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are
  the same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'
  element.

  The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
  hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
  subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
  that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

  Multiple weaknesses were found in the JBoss Web DIGEST authentication
  implementation, effectively reducing the security normally provided by
  DIGEST authentication. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform
  replay attacks in some circumstances. (CVE-2012-5885, CVE-2012-5886,
  CVE-2012-5887)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
  Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  BRMS installation (including its databases, applications, configuration
  files, and so on).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
