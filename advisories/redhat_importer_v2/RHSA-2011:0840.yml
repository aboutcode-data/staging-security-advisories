  - CVE-2011-0997
summary: |
  Updated dhcp packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Extended Life Cycle Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address.

  It was discovered that the DHCP client daemon, dhclient, did not
  sufficiently sanitize certain options provided in DHCP server replies, such
  as the client hostname. A malicious DHCP server could send such an option
  with a specially-crafted value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was
  saved on the client system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a
  process that assumes the option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of that process. (CVE-2011-0997)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for
  reporting this issue.

  All dhclient users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue.
