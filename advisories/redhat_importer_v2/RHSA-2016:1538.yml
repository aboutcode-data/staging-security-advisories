summary: |
  An update for golang is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The golang packages provide the Go programming language compiler.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: golang (1.6.3). (BZ#1346331)

  Security Fix(es):

  * An input-validation flaw was discovered in the Go programming language built in CGI implementation, which set the environment variable "HTTP_PROXY" using the incoming "Proxy" HTTP-request header. The environment variable "HTTP_PROXY" is used by numerous web clients, including Go's net/http package, to specify a proxy server to use for HTTP and, in some cases, HTTPS requests. This meant that when a CGI-based web application ran, an attacker could specify a proxy server which the application then used for subsequent outgoing requests, allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. (CVE-2016-5386)

  Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.
