summary: |
  Updated Apache httpd packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

  A flaw was found in the mod_imap module. On sites where mod_imap was
  enabled and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site scripting
  attack was possible. (CVE-2007-5000)

  A flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module. On sites where directory
  listings are used, and the "AddDefaultCharset" directive has been removed
  from the configuration, a cross-site scripting attack was possible against
  Web browsers which do not correctly derive the response character set
  following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)

  A flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status was
  enabled and the status pages were publicly available, a cross-site
  scripting attack was possible. (CVE-2007-6388)

  A flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites where mod_proxy_ftp
  was enabled and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting
  attack was possible against Web browsers which do not correctly derive the
  response character set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2008-0005)

  Users of Apache httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. Users should restart
  httpd after installing this update.
