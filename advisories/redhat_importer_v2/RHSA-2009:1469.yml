summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Extended Update Support.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * Michael Tokarev reported a flaw in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in
  the Linux kernel. This driver allowed interfaces using this driver to
  receive frames larger than what could be handled. This could lead to a
  remote denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1389, Important)

  * Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team reported a
  flaw in the SOCKOPS_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This macro did not
  initialize the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. A
  local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local denial of
  service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2692, Important)

  * Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team reported a
  flaw in the udp_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel when using the
  MSG_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user could use this
  flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2009-2698, Important)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
