aliases:
  - CVE-2002-0392
summary: |
  The Apache Web server contains a security vulnerability which can be used
  to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack or, in some cases, allow remote
  code execution.

  Versions of the Apache Web server up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug
  in the routines which deal with requests using "chunked" encoding.
  A carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child process to
  call the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the end of its
  buffer, corrupting the stack.  On some platforms this can be remotely
  exploited -- allowing arbitrary code to be run on the server.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.

  All users of Apache should update to these errata packages to correct this
  security issue.
