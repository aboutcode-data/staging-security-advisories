  - CVE-2016-0758
summary: |
  An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: kernel-rt (3.10.0-327.18.2). This version provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements, including:

  * [scsi] bnx2fc: Fix FCP RSP residual parsing and remove explicit logouts

  * [scsi] mpt3sas: Fix for Asynchronous completion of timedout IO and task abort of timedout IO

  * [scsi] scsi_error: should not get sense for timeout IO in scsi error handler

  * [scsi] Revert libiscsi: Reduce locking contention in fast path

  * [mm] madvise: fix MADV_WILLNEED on shmem swapouts

  * [cpufreq] intel_pstate: decrease number of "HWP enabled" messages and enable HWP per CPU

  * [kernel] sched: Robustify topology setup

  * [kernel] sched/fair: Disable tg load_avg/runnable_avg update for root_task_group

  * [kernel] sched/fair: Move hot load_avg/runnable_avg into separate cacheline

  * [ib] mlx5: Fix RC transport send queue overhead computation

  * [fs] nfsd: fix clp->cl_revoked list deletion causing softlock in nfsd

  * [fs] ceph: multiple updates

  (BZ#1322033)

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ASN.1 DER decoder processed certain certificate files with tags of indefinite length. A local, unprivileged user could use a specially crafted X.509 certificate DER file to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-0758, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Philip Pettersson of Samsung for reporting this issue.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * The hotplug lock and the console semaphore could be acquired in an incorrect order, which could previously lead to a deadlock causing the system console to freeze. The underlying code has been adjusted to acquire the locks in the correct order, resolving the bug with the console. (BZ#1324767)
