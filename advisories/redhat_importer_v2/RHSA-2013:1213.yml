  - CVE-2013-4169
summary: |
  Updated gdm and initscripts packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) provides the graphical login screen, shown
  shortly after boot up, log out, and when user-switching.

  A race condition was found in the way GDM handled the X server sockets
  directory located in the system temporary directory. An unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack, giving them write
  access to any file, allowing them to escalate their privileges to root.
  (CVE-2013-4169)

  Note that this erratum includes an updated initscripts package. To fix
  CVE-2013-4169, the vulnerable code was removed from GDM and the initscripts
  package was modified to create the affected directory safely during the
  system boot process. Therefore, this update will appear on all systems,
  however systems without GDM installed are not affected by this flaw.

  Red Hat would like to thank the researcher with the nickname vladz for
  reporting this issue.

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this
  issue. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
