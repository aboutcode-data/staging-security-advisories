  - CVE-2006-4600
summary: "A updated openldap packages that fix a security flaw and a memory leak bug\nare now\
  \ available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having low security\
  \ impact by the Red Hat \nSecurity Response Team.\n\nOpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP\
  \ (Lightweight Directory Access \nProtocol) applications, libraries and development tools.\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP handled selfwrite access. Users with\nselfwrite access\
  \ were able to modify the distinguished name of any user.\nUsers with selfwrite access should\
  \ only be able to modify their own\ndistinguished name. (CVE-2006-4600)\n\nA memory leak bug\
  \ was found in OpenLDAP's ldap_start_tls_s() function. An\napplication using this function\
  \ could result in an Out Of Memory (OOM)\ncondition, crashing the application.\n\nAll users\
  \ are advised to upgrade to this updated openldap package, \nwhich contains a backported fix\
  \ and is not vulnerable to these issues."
