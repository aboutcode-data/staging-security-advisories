  - CVE-2013-2175
summary: |
  An updated haproxy package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  HAProxy provides high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP
  and HTTP-based applications.

  A flaw was found in the way HAProxy handled requests when the proxy's
  configuration ("/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg") had certain rules that use the
  hdr_ip criterion. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash HAProxy
  instances that use the affected configuration. (CVE-2013-2175)

  Red Hat would like to thank HAProxy upstream for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges David Torgerson as the original reporter.

  HAProxy is released as a Technology Preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
  More information about Red Hat Technology Previews is available at
  https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/

  All users of haproxy are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
