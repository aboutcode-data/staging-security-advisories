  - CVE-2014-0174
summary: |
  An updated cumin package that fixes two security issues is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  It was found that if Cumin were asked to display a link name containing
  non-ASCII characters, the request would terminate with an error. If data
  containing non-ASCII characters were added to the database (such as via
  Cumin or Wallaby), requests to load said data would terminate and the
  requested page would not be displayed until an administrator cleans the
  database. (CVE-2012-2682)

  It was found that Cumin did not set the HttpOnly flag on session cookies.
  This could allow a malicious script to access the session cookie.
  (CVE-2014-0174)

  These issues were discovered by Stanislav Graf of Red Hat.

  All users of cumin with Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which corrects
  these issues.
