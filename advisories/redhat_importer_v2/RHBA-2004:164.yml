  - CVE-2004-2259
summary: |
  An updated vsftpd package that fixes a signal handling bug which could
  cause the service to stop accepting connections is now available.

  vsftpd is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) daemon.

  vsftpd was calling unsafe functions from within signal handlers; under
  heavy load, this could lead to deadlock, leading the service to stop
  accepting connections.

  Users of vsftpd should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves this
  issue.
