  - CVE-2004-2771
  - CVE-2014-7844
summary: |
  Updated mailx packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The mailx packages contain a mail user agent that is used to manage mail
  using scripts.

  A flaw was found in the way mailx handled the parsing of email addresses.
  A syntactically valid email address could allow a local attacker to cause
  mailx to execute arbitrary shell commands through shell meta-characters and
  the direct command execution functionality. (CVE-2004-2771, CVE-2014-7844)

  Note: Applications using mailx to send email to addresses obtained from
  untrusted sources will still remain vulnerable to other attacks if they
  accept email addresses which start with "-" (so that they can be confused
  with mailx options). To counteract this issue, this update also introduces
  the "--" option, which will treat the remaining command line arguments as
  email addresses.

  All mailx users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
