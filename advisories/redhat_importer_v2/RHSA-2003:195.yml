summary: "Updated kernel packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux are now available\nwhich address\
  \ several security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the\
  \ operating system.  \n\nSeveral security issues have been found that affect the Linux kernel:\n\
  \nAl Viro found a security issue in the tty layer whereby any user could\ncause a kernel oops.\
  \ The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2003-0247 to this issue.\n\nAndrea Arcangeli found an issue in the low-level mxcsr code\
  \ in which a\nmalformed address would leave garbage in cpu state registers. The Common\nVulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\nname CAN-2003-0248 to this issue.\n\
  \nThe TCP/IP fragment reassembly handling allows remote attackers to cause a\ndenial of service\
  \ (CPU consumption) via packets that cause a large number\nof hash table collisions, a vulnerability\
  \ similar to CAN-2003-0244. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0364 to this issue.\n\nThese kernels also contain updated\
  \ fixes for the ioperm security issue, as\nwell as fixes for a number of bugs.\n\nIt is recommended\
  \ that users upgrade to these erratum kernels, which\ncontain patches to correct these vulnerabilities."
