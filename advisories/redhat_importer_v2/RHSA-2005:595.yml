summary: "An updated squirrelmail package that fixes two security issues is now\navailable.\n\
  \nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\n[Updated 04 Aug 2005]\nThe previous SquirrelMail package released with this errata\
  \ contained a bug\nwhich rendered the addressbook unusable. The erratum has been updated with\n\
  a package which corrects this issue.\n\nSquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package\
  \ written in PHP4.\n\nA bug was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the $_POST variable.\
  \ If a\nuser is tricked into visiting a malicious URL, the user's SquirrelMail\npreferences\
  \ could be read or modified. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project assigned the\
  \ name CAN-2005-2095 to this issue.\n\nSeveral cross-site scripting bugs were discovered in\
  \ SquirrelMail. An\nattacker could inject arbitrary Javascript or HTML content into\nSquirrelMail\
  \ pages by tricking a user into visiting a carefully crafted\nURL, or by sending them a carefully\
  \ constructed HTML email message. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned\
  \ the name\nCAN-2005-1769 to this issue. \n\nAll users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this\
  \ updated package, which\ncontains backported patches that resolve these issues."
