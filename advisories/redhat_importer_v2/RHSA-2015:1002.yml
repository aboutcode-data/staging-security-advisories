  - CVE-2015-3456
summary: |
  Updated xen packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
  managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the way QEMU's virtual
  Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) handled FIFO buffer access while processing
  certain FDC commands. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
  the guest or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with the
  privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to the guest.
  (CVE-2015-3456)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jason Geffner of CrowdStrike for reporting
  this issue.

  All xen users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, all running fully-virtualized guests must be restarted
  for this update to take effect.
