  - CVE-2010-3847
  - CVE-2010-3856
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
  programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
  standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system
  cannot function properly.

  It was discovered that the glibc dynamic linker/loader did not handle the
  $ORIGIN dynamic string token set in the LD_AUDIT environment variable
  securely. A local attacker with write access to a file system containing
  setuid or setgid binaries could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2010-3847)

  It was discovered that the glibc dynamic linker/loader did not perform
  sufficient safety checks when loading dynamic shared objects (DSOs) to
  provide callbacks for its auditing API during the execution of privileged
  programs. A local attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges
  via a carefully-chosen system DSO library containing unsafe constructors.
  (CVE-2010-3856)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting the CVE-2010-3847
  issue, and Ben Hawkes and Tavis Ormandy for reporting the CVE-2010-3856
  issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the generic implementation of the strstr() and memmem()
  functions did not handle certain periodic patterns correctly and could find
  a false positive match. This error has been fixed, and both functions now
  work as expected. (BZ#643341)

  * The "TCB_ALIGNMENT" value has been increased to 32 bytes to prevent
  applications from crashing during symbol resolution on 64-bit systems with
  support for Intel AVX vector registers. (BZ#643343)

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
