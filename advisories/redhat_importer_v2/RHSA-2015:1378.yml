  - CVE-2014-9273
summary: |
  Updated hivex packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Hivex is a library that can read and write Hive files, undocumented binary
  files that Windows uses to store the Windows Registry on disk.

  It was found that hivex attempted to read, and possibly write, beyond its
  allocated buffer when reading a hive file with a very small size or with a
  truncated or improperly formatted content. An attacker able to supply a
  specially crafted hive file to an application using the hivex library could
  possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running that application. (CVE-2014-9273)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mahmoud Al-Qudsi of NeoSmart Technologies for
  reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The hivex(3) man page previously contained a typographical error. This
  update fixes the typo. (BZ#1164693)

  All hivex users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
