  - CVE-2008-1447
summary: "Updated bind packages that help mitigate DNS spoofing attacks are now\navailable.\
  \ \n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security\
  \ Response Team.\n\n[Updated 10th July 2008]\nWe have updated the Enterprise Linux 5 packages\
  \ in this advisory. The\ndefault and sample caching-nameserver configuration files have been\
  \ updated\nso that they do not specify a fixed query-source port.  Administrators\nwishing\
  \ to take advantage of randomized UDP source ports should check their\nconfiguration file\
  \ to ensure they have not specified fixed query-source ports.\n\nISC BIND (Berkeley Internet\
  \ Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS\n(Domain Name System) protocols.\n\nThe DNS\
  \ protocol protects against spoofing attacks by requiring an attacker\nto predict both the\
  \ DNS transaction ID and UDP source port of a request. In\nrecent years, a number of papers\
  \ have found problems with DNS\nimplementations which make it easier for an attacker to perform\
  \ DNS\ncache-poisoning attacks.\n\nPrevious versions of BIND did not use randomized UDP source\
  \ ports. If an\nattacker was able to predict the random DNS transaction ID, this could make\n\
  DNS cache-poisoning attacks easier. In order to provide more resilience,\nBIND has been updated\
  \ to use a range of random UDP source ports.\n(CVE-2008-1447)\n\nNote: This errata also updates\
  \ SELinux policy on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4\nand 5 to allow BIND to use random UDP source\
  \ ports.\n\nUsers of BIND are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain\
  \ a backported patch to add this functionality.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Dan Kaminsky\
  \ for reporting this issue."
