summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix various security issues and several bugs\nin the\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe kernel packages\
  \ contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system. \n\nThese updated packages\
  \ fix the following security issues:\n\nA flaw was found in the handling of IEEE 802.11 frames,\
  \ which affected\nseveral wireless LAN modules. In certain situations, a remote attacker\n\
  could trigger this flaw by sending a malicious packet over a wireless\nnetwork, causing a\
  \ denial of service (kernel crash).\n(CVE-2007-4997, Important)\n\nA memory leak was found\
  \ in the Red Hat Content Accelerator kernel patch.\nA local user could use this flaw to cause\
  \ a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2007-5494, Important)\n\nAdditionally, the\
  \ following bugs were fixed:\n\n* when running the \"ls -la\" command on an NFSv4 mount point,\
  \ incorrect\nfile attributes, and outdated file size and timestamp information were\nreturned.\
  \ As well, symbolic links may have been displayed as actual files.\n\n* a bug which caused\
  \ the cmirror write path to appear deadlocked after a\nsuccessful recovery, which may have\
  \ caused syncing to hang, has been\nresolved.\n\n* a kernel panic which occurred when manually\
  \ configuring LCS interfaces on\nthe IBM S/390 has been resolved.\n\n* when running a 32-bit\
  \ binary on a 64-bit system, it was possible to\nmmap page at address 0 without flag MAP_FIXED\
  \ set. This has been\nresolved in these updated packages.\n\n* the Non-Maskable Interrupt\
  \ (NMI) Watchdog did not increment the NMI\ninterrupt counter in \"/proc/interrupts\" on systems\
  \ running an AMD Opteron\nCPU. This caused systems running NMI Watchdog to restart at regular\n\
  intervals.\n\n* a bug which caused the diskdump utility to run very slowly on devices\nusing\
  \ Fusion MPT has been resolved.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\
  \ which resolve\nthese issues."
