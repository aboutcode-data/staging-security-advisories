summary: "An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes three security issues and\none bug\
  \ is now available.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important\
  \ security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed\
  \ severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References\
  \ section.\n\nThe rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\n\
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated\
  \ Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run\
  \ and manage virtual machines: a subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment\
  \ and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\
  \ Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization\
  \ extensions.\n\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's\n\
  networking implementation handled logging while processing certain invalid\npackets coming\
  \ in via a VxLAN interface. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to crash the system by\
  \ sending a specially crafted packet to such an\ninterface. (CVE-2014-3535)\n\nTwo integer\
  \ overflow flaws were found in the QEMU block driver for QCOW\nversion 1 disk images. A user\
  \ able to alter the QEMU disk image files\nloaded by a guest could use either of these flaws\
  \ to corrupt QEMU process\nmemory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary\
  \ code\nexecution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.\n(CVE-2014-0222, CVE-2014-0223)\n\
  \nRed Hat would like to thank NSA for reporting CVE-2014-0222 and \nCVE-2014-0223.\n\nThis\
  \ update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, an updated version of Qlogic firmware\
  \ was not supported in\nthe Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 6.5 image and an\
  \ error\nmessage returned when users were using a newer version of Qlogic firmware.\nThis\
  \ update includes the latest Qlogic firmware package in the Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization\
  \ Hypervisor 6.5 image so no firmware errors are\nreturned. (BZ#1135780)\n\nThis updated package\
  \ also provides updated components that include fixes\nfor various security issues. These\
  \ issues have no security impact on Red\nHat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself,\
  \ however. The security\nfixes included in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\
  \nCVE-2012-6647, CVE-2013-7339, CVE-2014-2672, CVE-2014-2678, CVE-2014-2706,\nCVE-2014-2851,\
  \ CVE-2014-3144, CVE-2014-3145, CVE-2014-0205, CVE-2014-3917,\nand CVE-2014-4667 (kernel issues)\n\
  \nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this\
  \ updated package."
