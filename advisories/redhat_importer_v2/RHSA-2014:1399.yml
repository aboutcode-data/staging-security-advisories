  Apache POI is a library providing Java API for working with OOXML document
  files.

  It was found that Apache POI would resolve entities in OOXML documents.
  A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that are parsed by Apache
  POI could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the
  application server, and potentially perform more advanced XML External
  Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2014-3529)

  It was found that Apache POI would expand an unlimited number of entities
  in OOXML documents. A remote attacker able to supply OOXML documents that
  are parsed by Apache POI could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service
  attack via excessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2014-3574)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.3 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.
