aliases:
  - CVE-2016-1285
  - CVE-2016-1286
summary: |
  An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND parsed signature records for DNAME records. By sending a specially crafted query, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause named to crash. (CVE-2016-1286)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND processed certain control channel input. A remote attacker able to send a malformed packet to the control channel could use this flaw to cause named to crash. (CVE-2016-1285)

  Red Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting these issues.
