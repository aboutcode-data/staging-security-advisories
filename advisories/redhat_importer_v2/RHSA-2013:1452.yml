  - CVE-2013-5745
summary: |
  Updated vino packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Vino is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server for GNOME. It allows
  remote users to connect to a running GNOME session using VNC.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Vino handled certain
  authenticated requests from clients that were in the deferred state. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to make the vino-server process enter
  an infinite loop when processing those incoming requests. (CVE-2013-5745)

  All vino users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The GNOME session must be
  restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
