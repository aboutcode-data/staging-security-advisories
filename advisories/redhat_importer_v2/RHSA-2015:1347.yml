  - CVE-2012-2662
summary: |
  Updated pki-core packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to
  manage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. PKI Core
  contains fundamental packages required by Red Hat Certificate System, which
  comprise the Certificate Authority (CA) subsystem.

  Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in the Red Hat
  Certificate System Agent and End Entity pages. An attacker could use these
  flaws to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims using
  the Certificate System's web interface. (CVE-2012-2662)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, pki-core required the SSL version 3 (SSLv3) protocol ranges
  to communicate with the 389-ds-base packages. However, recent changes to
  389-ds-base disabled the default use of SSLv3 and enforced using protocol
  ranges supported by secure protocols, such as the TLS protocol. As a
  consequence, the CA failed to install during an Identity Management (IdM)
  server installation. This update adds TLS-related parameters to the
  server.xml file of the CA to fix this problem, and running the
  ipa-server-install command now installs the CA as expected. (BZ#1171848)

  * Previously, the ipa-server-install script failed when attempting to
  configure a stand-alone CA on systems with OpenJDK version 1.8.0 installed.
  The pki-core build and runtime dependencies have been modified to use
  OpenJDK version 1.7.0 during the stand-alone CA configuration. As a result,
  ipa-server-install no longer fails in this situation. (BZ#1212557)

  * Creating a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 replica from a Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 replica running the CA service sometimes failed in IdM deployments
  where the initial Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 CA master had been removed.
  This could cause problems in some situations, such as when migrating from
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The bug occurred
  due to a problem in a previous version of IdM where the subsystem user,
  created during the initial CA server installation, was removed together
  with the initial master. This update adds the restore-subsystem-user.py
  script that restores the subsystem user in the described situation, thus
  enabling administrators to create a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 replica in
  this scenario. (BZ#1225589)

  * Several Java import statements specify wildcard arguments. However, due
  to the use of wildcard arguments in the import statements of the source
  code contained in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 maintenance branch, a name
  space collision created the potential for an incorrect class to be
  utilized. As a consequence, the Token Processing System (TPS) rebuild test
  failed with an error message. This update addresses the bug by supplying
  the fully named class in all of the affected areas, and the TPS rebuild
  test no longer fails. (BZ#1144188)

  * Previously, pki-core failed to build with the rebased version of the
  CMake build system during the TPS rebuild test. The pki-core build files
  have been updated to comply with the rebased version of CMake. As a result,
  pki-core builds successfully in the described scenario. (BZ#1144608)

  Users of pki-core are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
