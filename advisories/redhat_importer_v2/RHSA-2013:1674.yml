  - CVE-2012-4453
summary: |
  Updated dracut packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The dracut packages include an event-driven initramfs generator
  infrastructure based on the udev device manager. The virtual file system,
  initramfs, is loaded together with the kernel at boot time and initializes
  the system, so it can read and boot from the root partition.

  It was discovered that dracut created initramfs images as world readable.
  A local user could possibly use this flaw to obtain sensitive information
  from these files, such as iSCSI authentication passwords, encrypted root
  file system crypttab passwords, or other information. (CVE-2012-4453)

  This issue was discovered by Peter Jones of the Red Hat Installer Team.

  These updated dracut packages include numerous bug fixes and two
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
  of these changes.

  All dracut users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
