summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and add
  one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  It was found that PHP did not properly handle file names with a NULL
  character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a PHP
  script access unexpected files and bypass intended file system access
  restrictions. (CVE-2006-7243)

  A flaw was found in PHP's SSL client's hostname identity check when
  handling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL bytes. If an
  attacker was able to get a carefully crafted certificate signed by a
  trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could use the certificate to
  conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers. (CVE-2013-4248)

  It was found that the PHP SOAP parser allowed the expansion of external XML
  entities during SOAP message parsing. A remote attacker could possibly use
  this flaw to read arbitrary files that are accessible to a PHP application
  using a SOAP extension. (CVE-2013-1643)

  This update fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, when the allow_call_time_pass_reference setting was disabled,
  a virtual host on the Apache server could terminate with a segmentation
  fault when attempting to process certain PHP content. This bug has been
  fixed and virtual hosts no longer crash when allow_call_time_pass_reference
  is off. (BZ#892158, BZ#910466)

  * Prior to this update, if an error occurred during the operation of the
  fclose(), file_put_contents(), or copy() function, the function did not
  report it. This could have led to data loss. With this update, the
  aforementioned functions have been modified to properly report any errors.
  (BZ#947429)

  * The internal buffer for the SQLSTATE error code can store maximum of 5
  characters. Previously, when certain calls exceeded this limit, a buffer
  overflow occurred. With this update, messages longer than 5 characters are
  automatically replaced with the default "HY000" string, thus preventing the
  overflow. (BZ#969110)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * This update adds the following rpm macros to the php package: %__php,
  %php_inidir, %php_incldir. (BZ#953814)

  Users of php are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix
  these bugs and add this enhancement. After installing the updated packages,
  the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
