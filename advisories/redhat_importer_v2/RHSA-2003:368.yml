  - CVE-2003-0961
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that address several security vulnerabilites, fix a
  number of bugs, and update various drivers are now available.

  The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

  A flaw in bounds checking in the do_brk() function in the Linux kernel
  versions 2.4.22 and previous can allow a local attacker to gain root
  privileges. This issue is known to be exploitable; an exploit (for x86
  architectures) has been seen in the wild that takes advantage of this
  vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0961 to this issue.

  The execve system call in Linux 2.4.x records the file descriptor of the
  executable process in the file table of the calling process, which allows
  local users to gain read access to restricted file descriptors.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0476 to this issue.

  A hangcheck timer (which is used to detect system hangs or pauses) has been
  added.

  In addition, a number of drivers have been updated:

  - e1000 5.2.20-k1
  - cmpci 5.64
  - aic7xxx 6.2.36
  - aic79xx 1.3.10
  - ips 6.10.52
  - cciss 2.4.50
  - fusion 2.05.05+

  All users of IA64 systems should upgrade to these errata packages, which
  contain patches to the 2.4.18 kernel addressing these issues.
