  - CVE-2014-7144
summary: |
  Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue and two
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command line utility for
  interacting with the OpenStack Identity API.

  It was found that Python-keystoneclient treated all settings in paste.ini
  files as string types. If the "insecure" option were set to any value in a
  paste.ini configuration file, it would be evaluated as true, resulting in
  TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
  (CVE-2014-7144)

  Note that when the "insecure" option was not set in paste.ini, it evaluated
  to false, and verification was performed.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, when running Python-keystoneclient in the DEBUG log level,
  sensitive data may have been logged in plain text. Refer to the OSSN-0024
  document, linked to in the References, for further information.
  (BZ#1106328)

  * Previously, when attempting to enable the use of the s3_token middleware,
  for use with the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) APIs, a "No
  module named webob" error was returned. (BZ#1133431)

  All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
