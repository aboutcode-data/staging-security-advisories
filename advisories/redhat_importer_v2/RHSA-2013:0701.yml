  - CVE-2013-0269
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-ruby, rubygem-json and rubygem-rdoc packages that fix two
  security issues are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  A flaw in rubygem-json and ruby193-rubygem-json allowed remote attacks by
  creating different types of malicious objects. For example, it could
  initiate a denial of service attack through resource consumption by using a
  JSON document to create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage
  collected. It could also be exploited to create internal objects which
  could allow a SQL injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

  It was found that documentation created by rubygem-rdoc and
  ruby193-rubygem-rdoc was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
  If such documentation was accessible over a network, and a remote attacker
  could trick a user into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to
  arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's session. As
  rubygem-rdoc and ruby193-rubygem-rdoc are used for creating documentation
  for Ruby source files (such as classes, modules, and so on), it is not a
  common scenario to make such documentation accessible over the network.
  (CVE-2013-0256)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting
  CVE-2013-0269, and Eric Hodel of RDoc upstream for reporting CVE-2013-0256.
  Upstream acknowledges Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag and Ben Murphy as the
  original reporters of CVE-2013-0269, and Evgeny Ermakov as the original
  reporter of CVE-2013-0256.

  Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct these issues.
