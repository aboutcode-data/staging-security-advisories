  - CVE-2015-7713
summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
  Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
  orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and
  controlling access through users and projects.

  A flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Compute (nova) snapshot feature when
  using the libvirt driver. A compute user could overwrite an attached
  instance disk with a malicious header specifying a backing file, and then
  request a snapshot, causing a file from the compute host to be leaked. This
  flaw only affects LVM or Ceph setups, or setups using filesystem storage
  with "use_cow_images = False". (CVE-2015-7548)

  A vulnerability was discovered in the way OpenStack Compute (nova)
  networking handled security group updates; changes were not applied to
  already running VM instances. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  access running VM instances. (CVE-2015-7713)

  The CVE-2015-7548 issue was discovered by Matthew Booth of Red Hat
  OpenStack Engineering.

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues.
