  - CVE-2013-0170
summary: |
  Updated libvirt packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
  virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In
  addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized
  systems.

  A flaw was found in the way libvirtd handled connection cleanup (when a
  connection was being closed) under certain error conditions. A remote
  attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use
  this flaw to crash libvirtd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the root user. (CVE-2013-0170)

  This issue was discovered by Tingting Zheng of Red Hat.

  All users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  the updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.
