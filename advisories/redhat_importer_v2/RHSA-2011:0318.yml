  - CVE-2011-0192
summary: |
  Updated libtiff packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
  Image File Format (TIFF) files.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff processed
  certain TIFF Internet Fax image files, compressed with the CCITT Group 4
  compression algorithm. An attacker could use this flaw to create a
  specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application
  linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2011-0192)

  Red Hat would like to thank Apple Product Security for reporting this
  issue.

  All libtiff users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. All running applications linked
  against libtiff must be restarted for this update to take effect.
