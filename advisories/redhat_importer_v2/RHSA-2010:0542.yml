  - CVE-2010-0212
summary: |
  Updated openldap packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol) applications and development tools.

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the way the slapd daemon handled modify
  relative distinguished name (modrdn) requests. An authenticated user with
  privileges to perform modrdn operations could use these flaws to crash the
  slapd daemon via specially-crafted modrdn requests. (CVE-2010-0211,
  CVE-2010-0212)

  Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for responsibly reporting these flaws,
  who credit Ilkka Mattila and Tuomas Salomäki for the discovery of the
  issues.

  Users of OpenLDAP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct these issues. After installing this update,
  the OpenLDAP daemons will be restarted automatically.
