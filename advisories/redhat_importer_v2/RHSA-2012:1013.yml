  - CVE-2012-1167
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Java Authorization Contract for Containers (Java ACC) specification
  defines Permission classes and the binding of container access decisions to
  operations on instances of these permission classes. JaccAuthorizationRealm
  performs authorization based on Java ACC permissions and a Policy
  implementation.

  When a JBoss server is configured to use JaccAuthorizationRealm, the
  WebPermissionMapping class creates permissions that are not checked and can
  permit access to users without checking their roles. If the
  ignoreBaseDecision property is set to true on JBossWebRealm, the web
  authorization process is handled exclusively by JBossAuthorizationEngine,
  without any input from JBoss Web. This allows any valid user to access an
  application, without needing to be assigned the role specified in the
  application's web.xml "security-constraint" tag. (CVE-2012-1167)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
