summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function
  in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
  implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP
  packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-0008, Important)

  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel. During a
  core dump, the kernel did not check if the Virtual Dynamically-linked
  Shared Object page was accessible. On Intel 64 and AMD64 systems, a local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic by running a
  crafted 32-bit application. (CVE-2009-4271, Important)

  * an information leak was found in the print_fatal_signal() implementation
  in the Linux kernel. When "/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals" is set to
  1 (the default value is 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be
  leaked to user-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note
  that this flaw only affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003,
  Moderate)

  * on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure the
  ELF interpreter was available before making a call to the SET_PERSONALITY
  macro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by
  running a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application.
  (CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)

  * missing capability checks were found in the ebtables implementation, used
  for creating an Ethernet bridge firewall. This could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions and modify
  ebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * under some circumstances, a locking bug could have caused an online ext3
  file system resize to deadlock, which may have, in turn, caused the file
  system or the entire system to become unresponsive. In either case, a
  reboot was required after the deadlock. With this update, using resize2fs
  to perform an online resize of an ext3 file system works as expected.
  (BZ#553135)

  * some ATA and SCSI devices were not honoring the barrier=1 mount option,
  which could result in data loss after a crash or power loss. This update
  applies a patch to the Linux SCSI driver to ensure ordered write caching.
  This solution does not provide cache flushes; however, it does provide
  data integrity on devices that have no write caching (or where write
  caching is disabled) and no command queuing. For systems that have command
  queuing or write cache enabled there is no guarantee of data integrity
  after a crash. (BZ#560563)

  * it was found that lpfc_find_target() could loop continuously when
  scanning a list of nodes due to a missing spinlock. This missing spinlock
  allowed the list to be changed after the list_empty() test, resulting in a
  NULL value, causing the loop. This update adds the spinlock, resolving the
  issue. (BZ#561453)

  * the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0020 introduced a
  regression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using
  the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for
  such devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid
  options:

  "Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported
  not setting wol"

  This update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for
  network devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#565496)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
