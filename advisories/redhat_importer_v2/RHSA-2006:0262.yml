  - CVE-2006-0746
summary: |
  Updated kdegraphics packages that fully resolve a security issue in kpdf
  are now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop Environment
  including kpdf, a PDF file viewer.

  Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered that a kpdf security fix, CVE-2005-3627,
  was incomplete.  Red Hat issued kdegraphics packages with this incomplete
  fix in RHSA-2005:868.  An attacker could construct a carefully crafted PDF
  file that could cause kpdf to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when
  opened.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name
  CVE-2006-0746 to this issue.

  Users of kpdf should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
