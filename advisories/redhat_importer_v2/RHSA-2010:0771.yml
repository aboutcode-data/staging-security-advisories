summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and upgrade
  the kernel-rt kernel to version 2.6.33.7-rt29 are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG 1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * On AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure the
  ELF interpreter was available before making a call to the SET_PERSONALITY
  macro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by
  running a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application.
  (CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)

  * Information leak flaws were found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control
  Unit implementation. A local attacker could use these flaws to cause the
  kernel to leak kernel memory to user-space, possibly leading to the
  disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2942, Moderate)

  * It was found that wireless drivers might not always clear allocated
  buffers when handling a driver-specific IOCTL information request. A local
  user could trigger this flaw to cause kernel memory to leak from the heap
  to user-space, leading to an information leak. (CVE-2010-2955, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the eql_g_master_cfg() function in the Linux kernel
  equalizer load-balancer for serial network interfaces implementation. A
  data structure in eql_g_master_cfg() was not initialized properly before
  being copied to user-space. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
  to cause an information leak. (CVE-2010-3297, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mathias Krause for reporting CVE-2010-0307, and
  Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-3297.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The mkinitrd utility reported the following warning message when creating
  an initial ramdisk:

  No module dm-mem-cache found for kernel [version], aborting.

  This was caused by an erroneous dependency on dmraid-related modules. This
  update removes these dependencies with the result that mkinitrd does not
  issue a spurious warning about the dm-mem-cache module not being found.
  (BZ#482753)

  * The ibm_rtl kernel module now performs more exhaustive checking to ensure
  it only loads on correct IBM hardware. (BZ#612275)

  * The realtime Linux kernel has been upgraded to upstream version
  2.6.33.7-rt29, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements for
  Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.3. (BZ#638672)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
  kernel to version 2.6.33.7-rt29 to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
