summary: "An updated thunderbird package that fixes various bugs is now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by\
  \ the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup\
  \ client.\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes certain international\ndomain\
  \ names. An attacker could create a specially crafted HTML mail, which\nwhen viewed by the\
  \ victim would cause Thunderbird to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. Thunderbird\
  \ as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 4 must have international domain names enabled\
  \ by the user in order\nto be vulnerable to this issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n\
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2871 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found\
  \ in the way Thunderbird processes certain Unicode sequences.\nIt may be possible to execute\
  \ arbitrary code as the user running\nThunderbird if the user views a specially crafted HTML\
  \ mail containing\nUnicode sequences. (CAN-2005-2702)\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird\
  \ makes XMLHttp requests. It is\npossible that a malicious HTML mail could leverage this flaw\
  \ to exploit\nother proxy or server flaws from the victim's machine. It is also possible\n\
  that this flaw could be leveraged to send XMLHttp requests to hosts other\nthan the originator;\
  \ the default behavior of Thunderbird is to disallow\nsuch actions. (CAN-2005-2703)\n\nA bug\
  \ was found in the way Thunderbird implemented its XBL interface. It\nmay be possible for\
  \ a malicious HTML mail to create an XBL binding in such\na way that would allow arbitrary\
  \ JavaScript execution with chrome\npermissions. Please note that in Thunderbird 1.0.6 this\
  \ issue is not\ndirectly exploitable and will need to leverage other unknown exploits.\n(CAN-2005-2704)\n\
  \nAn integer overflow bug was found in Thunderbird's JavaScript engine. Under\nfavorable conditions,\
  \ it may be possible for a malicious mail message to\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running\
  \ Thunderbird. Please note that\nJavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird.\
  \ (CAN-2005-2705)\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird displays about: pages. It is\n\
  possible for a malicious HTML mail to open an about: page, such as\nabout:mozilla, in such\
  \ a way that it becomes possible to execute JavaScript\nwith chrome privileges. (CAN-2005-2706)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird opens new windows. It is possible\nfor a malicious\
  \ HTML mail to construct a new window without any user\ninterface components, such as the\
  \ address bar and the status bar. This\nwindow could then be used to mislead the user for\
  \ malicious purposes.\n(CAN-2005-2707)\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes\
  \ URLs passed to it on the\ncommand line. If a user passes a malformed URL to Thunderbird,\
  \ such as\nclicking on a link in an instant messaging program, it is possible to\nexecute\
  \ arbitrary commands as the user running Thunderbird. (CAN-2005-2968) \n\nUsers of Thunderbird\
  \ are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains Thunderbird version 1.0.7\
  \ and is not vulnerable to these issues."
