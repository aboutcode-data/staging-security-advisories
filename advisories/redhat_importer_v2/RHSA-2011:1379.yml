summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third-party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference and assertion failure flaws were found
  in the MIT Kerberos KDC when it was configured to use an LDAP (Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol) or Berkeley Database (Berkeley DB) back end. A
  remote attacker could use these flaws to crash the KDC. (CVE-2011-1527,
  CVE-2011-1528, CVE-2011-1529)

  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting the
  CVE-2011-1527 issue. Upstream acknowledges Andrej Ota as the original
  reporter of CVE-2011-1527.

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the krb5kdc daemon will be restarted automatically.
