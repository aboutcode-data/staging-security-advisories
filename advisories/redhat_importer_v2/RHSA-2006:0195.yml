  - CVE-2005-1918
summary: "An updated tar package that fixes a path traversal flaw is now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\
  \nThe GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can\nrestore individual\
  \ files (or all of the files) from that archive. \n\nIn 2002, a path traversal flaw was found\
  \ in the way GNU tar extracted\narchives. A malicious user could create a tar archive that\
  \ could write to\narbitrary files to which the user running GNU tar has write access\n(CVE-2002-0399).\
  \  Red Hat included a backported security patch to correct\nthis issue in Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 3, and an erratum for Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 2.1 users was issued.\n\nDuring internal\
  \ testing, we discovered that our backported security patch\ncontained an incorrect optimization\
  \ and therefore was not sufficient to\ncompletely correct this vulnerability.  The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CVE-2005-1918 to\
  \ this\nissue.\n\nUsers of tar should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\n\
  replacement backported patch to correct this issue."
