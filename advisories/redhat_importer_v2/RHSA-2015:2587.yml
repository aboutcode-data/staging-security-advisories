summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and
  one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Extended
  Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's file system implementation
  handled rename operations in which the source was inside and the
  destination was outside of a bind mount. A privileged user inside a
  container could use this flaw to escape the bind mount and, potentially,
  escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-2925, Important)

  * It was found that the x86 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is prone to
  a denial of service attack inside a virtualized environment in the form of
  an infinite loop in the microcode due to the way (sequential) delivering of
  benign exceptions such as #AC (alignment check exception) is handled.
  A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to create denial of
  service conditions on the host kernel. (CVE-2015-5307, Important)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPC
  subsystem initialized certain fields in an IPC object structure that were
  later used for permission checking before inserting the object into a
  globally visible list. A local, unprivileged user could potentially use
  this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-7613,
  Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Serebrin of Google Inc. for reporting the
  CVE-2015-5307 issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs and adds one enhancement:

  * When setting up an ESP IPsec connection, the aes_ctr algorithm did not
  work for ESP on a Power little endian VM host. As a consequence, a kernel
  error was previously returned and the connection failed to be established.
  A set of patches has been provided to fix this bug, and aes_ctr works for
  ESP in the described situation as expected. (BZ#1247127)

  * The redistribute3() function distributed entries across 3 nodes. However,
  some entries were moved an incorrect way, breaking the ordering. As a
  result, BUG() in the dm-btree-remove.c:shift() function occurred when
  entries were removed from the btree. A patch has been provided to fix this
  bug, and redistribute3() now works as expected. (BZ#1263945)

  * When booting an mpt2sas adapter in a huge DDW enabled slot on Power, the
  kernel previously generated a warning followed by a call trace.
  The provided patch set enhances the Power kernel to be able to support
  IOMMU as a fallback for the cases where the coherent mask of the device is
  not suitable for direct DMA. As a result, neither the warning nor the call
  trace occur in this scenario. (BZ#1267133)

  * If the client mounted /exports and tried to execute the "chown -R"
  command across the entire mountpoint, a warning about a circular directory
  structure was previously returned because mount points all had the same
  inode number. A set of patches has been provided to fix this bug, and mount
  points are now assigned with unique inode numbers as expected. (BZ#1273239)

  * Due to a validation error of in-kernel MMIO tracing, a VM became
  previously unresponsive when connected to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor. The provided patch fixes this bug by dropping the check in MMIO
  handler, and a VM continues running as expected. (BZ#1275149)

  * The NFS client could previously fail to send a CLOSE operation if the
  file was opened with O_WRONLY and the server restarted after the OPEN.
  Consequently, the server appeared in a state that could block other NFS
  operations from completing. The client's state flags have been modified to
  catch this condition and correctly CLOSE the file. (BZ#1275298)

  * This update sets multicast filters for multicast packets when the
  interface is not in promiscuous mode. This change has an impact on the RAR
  usage such that SR-IOV has some RARs reserved for its own usage as well.
  (BZ#1265091)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
