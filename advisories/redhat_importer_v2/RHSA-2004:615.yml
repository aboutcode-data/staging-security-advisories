  - CVE-2004-0989
summary: "An updated libxml2 package that fixes multiple buffer overflows is now\navailable.\n\
  \nlibxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.\n\nMultiple buffer overflow bugs have been\
  \ found in libxml2 versions prior to\n2.6.14.  If an attacker can trick a user into passing\
  \ a specially crafted\nFTP URL or FTP proxy URL to an application that uses the vulnerable\n\
  functions of libxml2, it could be possible to execute arbitrary code.  \nAdditionally, if\
  \ an attacker can return a specially crafted DNS request to\nlibxml2, it could be possible\
  \ to execute arbitrary code. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0989 to this issue.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches and is not vulnerable to these\
  \ issues."
