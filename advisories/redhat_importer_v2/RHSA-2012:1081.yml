  - CVE-2012-2337
summary: |
  An updated sudo package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
  certain users the ability to run commands as root.

  A flaw was found in the way the network matching code in sudo handled
  multiple IP networks listed in user specification configuration directives.
  A user, who is authorized to run commands with sudo on specific hosts,
  could use this flaw to bypass intended restrictions and run those commands
  on hosts not matched by any of the network specifications. (CVE-2012-2337)

  All users of sudo are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
