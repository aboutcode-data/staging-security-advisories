summary: |
  Updated openoffice.org packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenOffice.org is an office productivity suite that includes desktop
  applications, such as a word processor, spreadsheet application,
  presentation manager, formula editor, and a drawing program.

  An array index error and an integer signedness error were found in the way
  OpenOffice.org parsed certain Rich Text Format (RTF) files. An attacker
  could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted RTF file that, when
  opened, would cause OpenOffice.org to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.
  (CVE-2010-3451, CVE-2010-3452)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw and an array index error were found in
  the way OpenOffice.org parsed certain Microsoft Office Word documents. An
  attacker could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted Microsoft
  Office Word document that, when opened, would cause OpenOffice.org to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2010-3453, CVE-2010-3454)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenOffice.org
  parsed certain Microsoft Office PowerPoint files. An attacker could use
  this flaw to create a specially-crafted Microsoft Office PowerPoint file
  that, when opened, would cause OpenOffice.org to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2010-4253)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way OpenOffice.org
  parsed certain TARGA (Truevision TGA) files. An attacker could use this
  flaw to create a specially-crafted TARGA file. If a document containing
  this specially-crafted TARGA file was opened, or if a user tried to insert
  the file into an existing document, it would cause OpenOffice.org to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2010-4643)

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way OpenOffice.org handled the
  installation of XSLT filter descriptions packaged in Java Archive (JAR)
  files, as well as the installation of OpenOffice.org Extension (.oxt)
  files. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted XSLT
  filter description or extension file that, when opened, would cause the
  OpenOffice.org Extension Manager to modify files accessible to the user
  installing the JAR or extension file. (CVE-2010-3450)

  A flaw was found in the script that launches OpenOffice.org. In some
  situations, a "." character could be included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  variable, allowing a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org, if that user ran
  OpenOffice.org from within an attacker-controlled directory.
  (CVE-2010-3689)

  Red Hat would like to thank OpenOffice.org for reporting the CVE-2010-3451,
  CVE-2010-3452, CVE-2010-3453, CVE-2010-3454, and CVE-2010-4643 issues; and
  Dmitri Gribenko for reporting the CVE-2010-3689 issue. Upstream
  acknowledges Dan Rosenberg of Virtual Security Research as the original
  reporter of the CVE-2010-3451, CVE-2010-3452, CVE-2010-3453, and
  CVE-2010-3454 issues.

  All OpenOffice.org users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  instances of OpenOffice.org applications must be restarted for this update
  to take effect.
