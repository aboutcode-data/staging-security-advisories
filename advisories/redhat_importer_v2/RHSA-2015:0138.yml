  Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P8 (Patch 8 on Rollup Patch 1),
  which fixes two security issues, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Fuse ESB Enterprise is an integration platform based on Apache ServiceMix.
  Fuse MQ Enterprise, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards-compliant
  messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

  This release of Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 Patch 8 on Rollup
  Patch 1 (R1 P8) is an update to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 and Fuse MQ
  Enterprise 7.1.0. The following security issues are addressed with this
  release:

  It was found that if a configured LDAP server supported the unauthenticated
  authentication mechanism (as described by RFC 4513), the LDAPLoginModule
  implementation, provided by ActiveMQ Java Authentication and Authorization
  Service (JAAS), would consider an authentication attempt to be successful
  for a valid user that provided an empty password. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to bypass the authentication mechanism of an application
  using LDAPLoginModule, and assume a role of any valid user within
  that application. (CVE-2014-3612)

  It was discovered that Apache ActiveMQ performed XML External Entity (XXE)
  expansion when evaluating XPath expressions. A remote, attacker-controlled
  consumer able to specify an XPath-based selector to dequeue XML messages
  from an Apache ActiveMQ broker could use this flaw to read files accessible
  to the user running the broker, and potentially perform other more advanced
  XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3600)

  Red Hat would like to thank Georgi Geshev of MWR Labs for reporting these
  issues.

  Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
  installation instructions.

  All users of Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise/MQ
  Enterprise 7.1.0 R1 P8.
