summary: |
  Updated java-1.5.0-sun packages that correct several security issues are
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extras.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) contains the software and tools
  that users need to run applets and applications written using the Java
  programming language.

  The Javadoc tool was able to generate HTML documentation pages that
  contained cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  A remote attacker
  could use this to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. (CVE-2007-3503)

  The Java Web Start URL parsing component contained a buffer overflow
  vulnerability within the parsing code for JNLP files. A remote attacker
  could create a malicious JNLP file that could trigger this flaw and execute
  arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2007-3655)

  The JSSE component did not correctly process SSL/TLS handshake requests. A
  remote attacker who is able to connect to a JSSE-based service could
  trigger this flaw leading to a denial-of-service. (CVE-2007-3698)

  A flaw was found in the applet class loader. An untrusted applet could use
  this flaw to circumvent network access restrictions, possibly connecting to
  services hosted on the machine that executed the applet. (CVE-2007-3922)

  All users of java-sun-1.5.0 should upgrade to these packages, which contain
  Sun Java 1.5.0 Update 12 that corrects these issues.
