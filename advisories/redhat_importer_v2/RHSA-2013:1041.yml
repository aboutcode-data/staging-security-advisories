summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.3.0, which fixes one security issue,
  various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit
  2.2.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 2.3.0
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
  available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/

  This release also fixes the following security issue:

  A flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled
  deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the
  execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed
  on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending
  on the deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-2165)

  The fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be
  deserialized by RichFaces.

  If you require to whitelist a class that is not already listed, for
  example, a custom class, you can achieve this by following one of these
  methods:

  Method 1: Implementing the SerializableResource interface.
  In RichFaces 3, this is defined at
  org.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource and in RichFaces 4/5, at
  org.richfaces.resource.SerializableResource.

  Method 2: Adding the class to the resource-serialization.properties file
  (a default properties file is provided once this update is applied).
  To do this you can extend the framework provided properties file that is
  available under org.ajax4jsf.resource in RichFaces 3 and
  org.richfaces.resource in RichFaces 4/5. The modified properties file has
  to be copied into the classpath of your deployment under the
  version-specific packages.

  Where possible, it is recommended that Method 1 be followed.

  Red Hat would like to thank Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure
  Directions, Inc.) for reporting this issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing installation of
  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or Red Hat JBoss Web Server,
  and applications deployed to it.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Framework
  Kit 2.3.0.
