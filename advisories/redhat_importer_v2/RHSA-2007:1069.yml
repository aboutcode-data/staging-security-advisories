summary: "Updated tomcat packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Network Satellite Server. \n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nTomcat is a servlet container for Java\
  \ Servlet and JavaServer Pages\ntechnologies.\n\nIt was reported Tomcat did not properly handle\
  \ the following character\nsequence in a cookie: \\\" (a backslash followed by a double-quote).\
  \ It was\npossible remote attackers could use this failure to obtain sensitive\ninformation,\
  \ such as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks\n(CVE-2007-3385). \n\nTomcat was found\
  \ treating single quote characters -- ' -- as delimiters in\ncookies. This could allow remote\
  \ attackers to obtain sensitive information,\nsuch as session IDs, for session hijacking attacks\
  \ (CVE-2007-3382).\n\nThe default Tomcat configuration permitted the use of insecure\nSSL\
  \ cipher suites including the anonymous cipher suite. (CVE-2007-1858)\n\nTomcat permitted\
  \ various characters as path delimiters. If Tomcat was used\nbehind certain proxies and configured\
  \ to only proxy some contexts, an\nattacker could construct an HTTP request to work around\
  \ the context\nrestriction and potentially access non-proxied content. (CVE-2007-0450)\n\n\
  Directory listings were enabled by default in Tomcat. Information stored\nunprotected under\
  \ the document root was visible to anyone if the\nadministrator did not disable directory\
  \ listings. (CVE-2006-3835)\n\nIt was found that generating listings of large directories\
  \ was CPU\nintensive. An attacker could make repeated requests to obtain a directory\nlisting\
  \ of any large directory, leading to a denial of service.\n(CVE-2005-3510) \n\nTomcat was\
  \ found to accept multiple content-length headers in a\nrequest. This could allow attackers\
  \ to poison a web-cache, bypass web\napplication firewall protection, or conduct cross-site\
  \ scripting attacks.\n(CVE-2005-2090)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these erratum packages which\
  \ contain an update to\nTomcat that resolves these issues, and add the tyrex and\njakarta-commons-pool\
  \ packages which are required dependencies of the new\nTomcat version."
