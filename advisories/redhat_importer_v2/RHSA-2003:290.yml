summary: "Updated versions of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are available that fix\nseveral security\
  \ issues affecting OpenSSL and mod_ssl.  A number of bug\nfixes and new features are also\
  \ included.\n\nStronghold 4 contains a number of open source technologies, including\nOpenSSL\
  \ 0.9.6 and mod_ssl.\n\nNISCC testing of implementations of the SSL protocol uncovered two\
  \ bugs in\nOpenSSL 0.9.6.  The parsing of unusual ASN.1 tag values can cause OpenSSL\nto crash.\
  \  A remote attacker could trigger this bug by sending a carefully\ncrafted SSL client certificate\
  \ to the Stronghold Web server, which would\ncause the server child process handling the request\
  \ to terminate.  The\neffects of such an attack would be limited, as Apache is designed to\
  \ handle\nthis situation.  In most cases, an attack would simply cause increased\nserver load,\
  \ which would only last as long as an attacker continues to make\nmalicious connections. \
  \ The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names\
  \ CAN-2003-0543 and CAN-2003-0544 to\nthis issue.  \n\nBen Laurie found a bug in the optional\
  \ renegotiation code in mod_ssl\nthat can cause cipher suite restrictions to be ignored. This\
  \ is triggered\nif optional renegotiation is used (SSLOptions +OptRenegotiate) along with\n\
  verification of client certificates and a change to the cipher suite over\nthe renegotiation.\
  \  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2003-0192 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are advised to update\
  \ to these errata\nversions, which contain backported security fixes and are not vulnerable\
  \ to\nthese issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank NISCC, Stephen Henson, and Ben Laurie for\
  \ their\nwork on these vulnerabilities."
