summary: |
  An update for the RichFaces component that fixes one security issue is now
  available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 and 5.2.0; Red Hat JBoss Web Platform
  5.2.0; Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1; Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4.3.0 CP05 and
  5.3.1; Red Hat JBoss Portal 4.3 CP07 and 5.2.2; and Red Hat JBoss
  Operations Network 2.4.2 and 3.1.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  RichFaces is an open source framework that adds Ajax capability into
  existing JavaServer Faces (JSF) applications.

  A flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled
  deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the
  execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed
  on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending
  on the deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-2165)

  The fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be
  deserialized by RichFaces.

  If you require to whitelist a class that is not already listed, for
  example, a custom class, you can achieve this by following one of these
  methods:

  Method 1: Implementing the SerializableResource interface.
  In RichFaces 3, this is defined at
  org.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource and in RichFaces 4/5, at
  org.richfaces.resource.SerializableResource.

  Method 2: Adding the class to the resource-serialization.properties file
  (a default properties file is provided once this update is applied).
  To do this you can extend the framework provided properties file that is
  available under org.ajax4jsf.resource in RichFaces 3 and
  org.richfaces.resource in RichFaces 4/5. The modified properties file has
  to be copied into the classpath of your deployment under the
  version-specific packages.

  Where possible, it is recommended that Method 1 be followed.

  Red Hat would like to thank Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure
  Directions, Inc.) for reporting this issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing installation,
  including all applications, configuration files, databases and database
  settings, and so on. For Red Hat JBoss Operations Network, also back up
  the Red Hat JBoss Operations Network server's file system directory.

  All users of the affected products as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this update.
