aliases:
  - CVE-2014-7230
  - CVE-2014-7231
summary: |
  Updated openstack-trove packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Database (trove) is Database as a Service for Openstack. It runs
  entirely on OpenStack, with the goal of allowing users to quickly and
  easily utilize the features of a database without the burden of handling
  complex administrative tasks. Cloud users and database administrators can
  provision and manage multiple database instances as needed.

  It was found that the processutils.execute() and strutils.mask_password()
  functions did not correctly sanitize the authentication details from their
  output before storing them in log files. This could allow an attacker with
  read access to these log files to obtain sensitive information such as
  passwords. (CVE-2014-7230, CVE-2014-7231)

  The openstack-trove packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. (BZ#1149745)

  All openstack-trove users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
