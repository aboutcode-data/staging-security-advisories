  - CVE-2002-1348
summary: |
  New w3m packages are available that fix two cross-site scripting issues.

  w3m is a pager with Web browsing capabilities.  Two cross-site scripting
  (XSS) issues have been found in w3m.

  An XSS vulnerability in w3m 0.3.2 allows remote attackers to insert
  arbitrary HTML and web script into frames.  Frames are disabled by default
  in the version of w3m shipped with Red Hat Linux.  Therefore, this problem
  will not appear as long as users do not use w3m with the -F option, or
  enable frame support in either the /etc/w3m/w3mconfig or ~/.w3m/config
  configuration files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1335 to this issue.

  An XSS vulnerability in versions of w3m before 0.3.2.2 allows attackers to
  insert arbitrary HTML and web script into image attributes.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2002-1348 to this issue

  Users of w3m under Red Hat Linux versions 7.0J, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 are
  advised to upgrade to the updated packages containing w3m 0.3.1 with
  a patch to correct these issues.
