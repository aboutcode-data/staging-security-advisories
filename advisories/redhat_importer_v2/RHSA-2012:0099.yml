  - CVE-2011-4930
summary: |
  Updated Grid component packages that fix multiple security issues, multiple
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Grid provides high-throughput computing and enables enterprises to
  achieve higher peak computing capacity as well as improved infrastructure
  utilization by leveraging their existing technology to build high
  performance grids. MRG Grid provides a job-queueing mechanism, scheduling
  policy, and a priority scheme, as well as resource monitoring and resource
  management. Users submit their jobs to MRG Grid, where they are placed into
  a queue. MRG Grid then chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a
  policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user
  upon completion.

  Multiple format string flaws were found in Condor. An authenticated Condor
  service user could use these flaws to prevent other jobs from being
  scheduled and executed or crash the condor_schedd daemon. (CVE-2011-4930)

  These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 provide enhancements
  and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some select enhancements and
  fixes include:

  * Addition of -sort option to condor_status

  * Customized output from condor_q -run for EC2 jobs

  * Enhanced the summary line provided by condor_q

  * Improved Collector performance around blocking network calls

  * Fixed a memory leak associated with python-psycopg2 hit by cumin-data

  Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
  the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document for information on
  these changes:

  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html

  All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are advised
  to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and add the
  enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes.
