summary: "Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.3 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\n\
  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A\
  \ Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of components for hosting\
  \ Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet\
  \ container, Apache Tomcat Connector (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate,\
  \ and the Tomcat Native library.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.3 serves\
  \ as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements,\
  \ which are documented in the Release Notes documented linked to in the References.\n\nSecurity\
  \ Fix(es):\n\n* A session fixation flaw was found in the way Tomcat recycled the requestedSessionSSL\
  \ field. If at least one web application was configured to use the SSL session ID as the HTTP\
  \ session ID, an attacker could reuse a previously used session ID for further requests. (CVE-2015-5346)\n\
  \n* A CSRF flaw was found in Tomcat's the index pages for the Manager and Host Manager applications.\
  \ These applications included a valid CSRF token when issuing a redirect as a result of an\
  \ unauthenticated request to the root of the web application. This token could then be used\
  \ by an attacker to perform a CSRF attack. (CVE-2015-5351)\n\n* It was found that several\
  \ Tomcat session persistence mechanisms could allow a remote, authenticated user to bypass\
  \ intended SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context\
  \ via a web application that placed a crafted object in a session. (CVE-2016-0714)\n\n* A\
  \ security manager bypass flaw was found in Tomcat that could allow remote, authenticated\
  \ users to access arbitrary application data, potentially resulting in a denial of service.\
  \ (CVE-2016-0763) \n\n* It was found that Tomcat could reveal the presence of a directory\
  \ even when that directory was protected by a security constraint. A user could make a request\
  \ to a directory via a URL not ending with a slash and, depending on whether Tomcat redirected\
  \ that request, could confirm whether that directory existed. (CVE-2015-5345)\n\n* It was\
  \ found that Tomcat allowed the StatusManagerServlet to be loaded by a web application when\
  \ a security manager was configured. This allowed a web application to list all deployed web\
  \ applications and expose sensitive information such as session IDs. (CVE-2016-0706)"
