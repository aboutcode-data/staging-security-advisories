  - CVE-2012-1151
summary: |
  An updated perl-DBD-Pg package that fixes two security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Perl DBI is a database access Application Programming Interface (API) for
  the Perl language. perl-DBD-Pg allows Perl applications to access
  PostgreSQL database servers.

  Two format string flaws were found in perl-DBD-Pg. A specially-crafted
  database warning or error message from a server could cause an application
  using perl-DBD-Pg to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-1151)

  All users of perl-DBD-Pg are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to fix these issues. Applications using
  perl-DBD-Pg must be restarted for the update to take effect.
