summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.0, which fixes multiple security issues,
  various bugs, and adds enhancements is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform is a business rules management system for
  the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss
  Rules. The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) Java API allows Java
  software clients to locate objects or services in an application server.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.0 serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.2.0. It includes various
  bug fixes and enhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Enterprise BRMS
  Platform 5.3.0 Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly
  from https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote
  write access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to
  access the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,
  delete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,
  application-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)

  It was found that the invoker servlets, deployed by default via
  httpha-invoker, only performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST
  methods, allowing remote attackers to make unauthenticated requests by
  using different HTTP methods. Due to the second layer of authentication
  provided by a security interceptor, this issue is not exploitable on
  default installations unless an administrator has misconfigured the
  security interceptor or disabled it. (CVE-2011-4085)

  When a JGroups channel is started, the JGroups diagnostics service would be
  enabled by default with no authentication. This service is exposed via IP
  multicast. An attacker on an adjacent network could exploit this flaw to
  read diagnostics information. (CVE-2012-2377)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting
  CVE-2011-4605.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  BRMS Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise BRMS
  Platform 5.3.0.
