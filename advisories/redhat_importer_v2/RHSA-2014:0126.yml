  - CVE-2013-4449
summary: |
  Updated openldap packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenLDAP is an open source suite of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
  (LDAP) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of protocols used
  to access and maintain distributed directory information services over an
  IP network. The openldap package contains configuration files, libraries,
  and documentation for OpenLDAP.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the OpenLDAP server daemon
  (slapd) performed reference counting when using the rwm (rewrite/remap)
  overlay. A remote attacker able to query the OpenLDAP server could use this
  flaw to crash the server by immediately unbinding from the server after
  sending a search request. (CVE-2013-4449)

  Red Hat would like to thank Michael Vishchers from Seven Principles AG for
  reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, OpenLDAP did not properly handle a number of simultaneous
  updates. As a consequence, sending a number of parallel update requests to
  the server could cause a deadlock. With this update, a superfluous locking
  mechanism causing the deadlock has been removed, thus fixing the bug.
  (BZ#1056124)

  All openldap users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
