  - CVE-2014-0107
summary: |
  Updated xalan-j2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Xalan-Java is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML,
  text, or other XML document types.

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  All xalan-j2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
