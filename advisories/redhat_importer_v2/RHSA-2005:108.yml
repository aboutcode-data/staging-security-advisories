  - CVE-2005-0089
summary: |
  Updated Python packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

  An object traversal bug was found in the Python SimpleXMLRPCServer.  This
  bug could allow a remote untrusted user to do unrestricted object traversal
  and allow them to access or change function internals using the im_* and
  func_* attributes.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0089 to this issue.

  Users of Python are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
