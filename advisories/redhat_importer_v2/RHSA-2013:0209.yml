  - CVE-2013-0212
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  These packages provide a service (code name Glance) that acts as a registry
  for virtual machine images.

  It was found that when the OpenStack Glance front-end communicated with an
  OpenStack Swift endpoint, the operator credentials could be logged in
  plain text when certain errors occurred during new image creation. An
  authenticated user could use this flaw to gain administrative access to an
  OpenStack Swift endpoint. (CVE-2013-0212)

  This issue was discovered by Dan Prince of Red Hat.

  All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing the updated packages,
  the Glance services (openstack-glance-api and openstack-glance-registry)
  will be restarted automatically.
