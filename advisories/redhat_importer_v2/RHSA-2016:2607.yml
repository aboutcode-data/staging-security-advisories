  - CVE-2014-8165
summary: |
  An update for powerpc-utils-python is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The powerpc-utils-python packages provide Python-based utilities for maintaining and servicing PowerPC systems.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the amsvis command of the powerpc-utils-python package did not verify unpickled data before processing it. This could allow an attacker who can connect to an amsvis server process (or cause an amsvis client process to connect to them) to execute arbitrary code as the user running the amsvis process. (CVE-2014-8165)

  This issue was discovered by Dhiru Kholia of Red Hat Product Security.
