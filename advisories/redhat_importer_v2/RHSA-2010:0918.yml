  - CVE-2010-3846
summary: |
  An updated cvs package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Concurrent Version System (CVS) is a version control system that can record
  the history of your files.

  An array index error, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in
  the way CVS applied certain delta fragment changes from input files in the
  RCS (Revision Control System file) format. If an attacker in control of a
  CVS repository stored a specially-crafted RCS file in that repository, and
  then tricked a remote victim into checking out (updating their CVS
  repository tree) a revision containing that file, it could lead to
  arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the CVS server process
  on the system hosting the CVS repository. (CVE-2010-3846)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ralph Loader for reporting this issue.

  All users of cvs are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
