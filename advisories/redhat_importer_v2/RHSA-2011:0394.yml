  - CVE-2011-0720
summary: |
  Updated conga packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The conga packages provide a web-based administration tool for remote
  cluster and storage management.

  A privilege escalation flaw was found in luci, the Conga web-based
  administration application. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw
  to obtain administrative access, allowing them to read, create, or modify
  the content of the luci application. (CVE-2011-0720)

  Users of Conga are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, luci must be restarted ("service luci restart") for the
  update to take effect.
