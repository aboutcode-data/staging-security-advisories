summary: |
  An update for poppler is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Poppler is a Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering library, used by applications such as Evince.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the poppler library. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause applications that use poppler (such as Evince) to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2017-9775)

  * An integer overflow leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the poppler library. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause applications that use poppler (such as Evince) to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2017-9776)
