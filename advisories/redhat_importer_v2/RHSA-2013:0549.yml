summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Directory Server and related packages that fix one security
  issue and multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat Directory Server 8.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The redhat-ds-base packages provide Red Hat Directory Server, which is an
  LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight
  Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for
  server administration.

  A flaw was found in the way the 389 Directory Server daemon (ns-slapd)
  handled access control instructions (ACIs) using certificate groups. If an
  LDAP user that had a certificate group defined attempted to bind to the
  directory server, it would cause ns-slapd to enter an infinite loop and
  consume an excessive amount of CPU time. (CVE-2012-0833)

  Red Hat would like to thank Graham Leggett for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Search with a complex filter that included a range search filter was
  slow. (BZ#853004)

  * If the server was restarted, or there was some type of connection
  failure, it was possible that users were no longer able to log into the
  console. Manual action is required to apply this fix: You must add an aci
  to each "cn=Server Group" entry in "o=netscaperoot", that allows
  anonymous/all users read/search rights. (BZ#856089)

  * With replication enabled, trying to replace an existing value, where the
  new value only differs in case (for example, changing "cn: foo" to "cn:
  FOO"), resulted in the operation failing with an error 20. (BZ#891866)

  All users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.2 should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which resolve these issues.
