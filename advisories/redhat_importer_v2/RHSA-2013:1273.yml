  - CVE-2013-4324
summary: |
  Updated spice-gtk packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The spice-gtk packages provide a GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) widget for SPICE
  (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments) clients. Both
  Virtual Machine Manager and Virtual Machine Viewer can make use of this
  widget to access virtual machines using the SPICE protocol.

  spice-gtk communicated with PolicyKit for authorization via an API that is
  vulnerable to a race condition. This could lead to intended PolicyKit
  authorizations being bypassed. This update modifies spice-gtk to
  communicate with PolicyKit via a different API that is not vulnerable to
  the race condition. (CVE-2013-4324)

  All users of spice-gtk are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
