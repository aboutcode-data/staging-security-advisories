summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the madvise() system call
  implementation in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2012-3511, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite
  implementation handled IPv6 sockets that used the UDP_CORK option. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2013-4162, Moderate)

  * An information leak flaw in the Linux kernel could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to leak kernel memory to user-space. (CVE-2013-2141, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
  CVE-2013-4162.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * A bug in the be2net driver prevented communication between NICs using
  be2net. This update applies a patch addressing this problem along with
  several other upstream patches that fix various other problems. Traffic
  between NICs using the be2net driver now proceeds as expected. (BZ#983864)

  * A recent patch fixing a problem that prevented communication between
  NICs using the be2net driver caused the firmware of NICs to become
  unresponsive, and thus triggered a kernel panic. The problem was caused by
  unnecessary usage of a hardware workaround that allows skipping VLAN tag
  insertion. A patch has been applied and the workaround is now used only
  when the multi-channel configuration is enabled on the NIC. Note that the
  bug only affected the NICs with firmware version 4.2.xxxx. (BZ#999819)

  * A bug in the autofs4 mount expiration code could cause the autofs4
  module to falsely report a busy tree of NFS mounts as "not in use".
  Consequently, automount attempted to unmount the tree and failed with
  a "failed to umount offset" error, leaving the mount tree to appear as
  empty directories. A patch has been applied to remove an incorrectly used
  autofs dentry mount check and the aforementioned problem no longer occurs.
  (BZ#1001488)

  * A race condition in the be_open function in the be2net driver could
  trigger the BUG_ON() macro, which resulted in a kernel panic. A patch
  addressing this problem has been applied and the race condition is now
  avoided by enabling polling before enabling interrupts globally. The
  kernel no longer panics in this situation. (BZ#1005239)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
