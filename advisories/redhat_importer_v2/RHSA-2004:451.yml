  - CVE-2004-0796
summary: |
  An updated spamassassin package that fixes a denial of service bug when
  parsing malformed messages is now available.

  SpamAssassin provides a way to reduce unsolicited commercial email (SPAM)
  from incoming email.

  A denial of service bug has been found in SpamAssassin versions below 2.64.
  A malicious attacker could construct a message in such a way that would
  cause spamassassin to stop responding, potentially preventing the delivery
  or filtering of email.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0796 to this issue.

  Users of SpamAssassin should update to these updated packages which contain
  a backported patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.
