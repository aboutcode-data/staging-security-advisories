  - CVE-2014-9322
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled GS segment register
  base switching when recovering from a #SS (stack segment) fault on an
  erroneous return to user space. A local, unprivileged user could use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-9322, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andy Lutomirski for reporting this issue.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
