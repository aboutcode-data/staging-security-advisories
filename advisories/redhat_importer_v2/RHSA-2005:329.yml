  - CVE-2005-2495
summary: |
  Updated XFree86 packages that fix several integer overflows are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  XFree86 is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It
  provides the basic low-level functionality that full-fledged graphical
  user interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.

  Several integer overflow bugs were found in the way XFree86 parses pixmap
  images. It is possible for a user to gain elevated privileges by loading a
  specially crafted pixmap image. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2495 to this issue.

  Users of XFree86 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.
