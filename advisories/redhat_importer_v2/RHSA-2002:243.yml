summary: "Updated versions of the Apache HTTP server, PHP, and mod_ssl are now\navailable which\
  \ close possible buffer overflows in the Apache HTTP server\nbenchmarking tool, fixes two\
  \ cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the\nerror pages, and fix possible local privilege\
  \ escalation.  These updates\nalso fix vulnerabilities in the PHP mail() function that allows\
  \ script\nauthors to bypass safe mode restrictions, and possibly allow remote\nattackers to\
  \ insert arbitrary mail headers and content into messages.\n\nThe Apache HTTP server is a\
  \ powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.  PHP is an HTML-embedded\
  \ scripting language\ncommonly used with the Apache HTTP server.\n\nBuffer overflows in the\
  \ ApacheBench support program (ab.c) in Apache\nversions prior to 1.3.27, allow a malicious\
  \ Web server to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long\
  \ response.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0843\
  \ to this issue.\n\nTwo cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are present in the error pages\n\
  for the default \"404 Not Found\" error, and for the error response when a\nplain HTTP request\
  \ is received on an SSL port.  Both of these issues are\nonly exploitable if the \"UseCanonicalName\"\
  \ setting has been changed to\n\"Off\", and wildcard DNS is in use, and would allow remote\
  \ attackers\nto execute scripts as other Web page visitors, for instance, to steal\ncookies.\
  \  These issues affect Apache versions 1.3 to 1.3.26,\nand mod_ssl versions before 2.8.12.\
  \  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the names CAN-2002-0840\
  \ and\nCAN-2002-1157 to these issues.\n\nThe shared memory scoreboard in the HTTP daemon for\
  \ Apache 1.3.x, prior to\nversion 1.3.27, allowed a user running as the web server user to\
  \ send a\nSIGUSR1 signal to any process as root, resulting in a denial of service\n(process\
  \ kill) or other such behavior that would not normally be allowed. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-839 to this issue.\n\nThe mail function\
  \ in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 may allow local script authors to\nbypass safe mode restrictions and\
  \ modify command line arguments to the\nMTA (such as Sendmail) in the fifth argument to mail(),\
  \ altering MTA\nbehavior and possibly executing arbitrary local commands. The Common\nVulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2002-0985\nto this issue.\n\nThe mail function\
  \ in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 does not filter ASCII control\ncharacters from its arguments, which\
  \ could allow remote attackers to\nmodify mail message content, including mail headers, and\
  \ possibly use\nPHP as a \"spam proxy\". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0986 to this issue.\n\nStronghold contains Apache 1.3.22,\
  \ mod_ssl 2.8.7, and PHP 4.1.2, and\nis therefore vulnerable to these issues. Users of Stronghold\
  \ are advised to\npatch or upgrade their servers."
