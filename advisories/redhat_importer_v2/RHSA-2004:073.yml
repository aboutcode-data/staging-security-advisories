aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0104
  - CVE-2004-0105
summary: |
  Updated metamail packages that fix a number of vulnerabilities are now
  available.

  [Updated 18 February 2004]
  Updated description text to associate each CVE name with the appropriate bugs.

  Metamail is a system for handling multimedia mail.

  Ulf Harnhammar discovered two format string bugs and two buffer overflow
  bugs in versions of Metamail up to and including 2.7.  An attacker could
  create a carefully-crafted message such that when it is opened by a victim
  and parsed through Metamail, it runs arbitrary code as the victim.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the names CAN-2004-0104 (format strings) and CAN-2004-0105 (buffer
  overflows) to these issues.

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  erratum packages, which contain a backported security patch and are not
  vulnerable to these issues.  Please note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
  does not contain Metamail and is therefore not vulnerable to these issues.

  Red Hat would like to thank Ulf Harnhammar for the notification and patch
  for these issues.
