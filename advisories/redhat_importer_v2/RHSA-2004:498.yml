  - CVE-2004-0815
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix an input validation vulnerability are now
  available.

  Samba provides file and printer sharing services to SMB/CIFS clients.

  Karol Wiesek discovered an input validation issue in Samba prior to 3.0.6.
  An authenticated user could send a carefully crafted request to the Samba
  server, which would allow access to files outside of the configured file
  share.  Note: Such files would have to be readable by the account used
  for the connection.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0815 to this issue.

  This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 as a previous erratum
  updated to Samba 3.0.6 which is not vulnerable to this issue.

  Users of Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain an
  upgrade to Samba-2.2.12, which is not vulnerable to this issue.
