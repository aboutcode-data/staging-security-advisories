  - CVE-2013-1762
summary: |
  An updated stunnel package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  stunnel is a socket wrapper which can provide SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
  support to ordinary applications. For example, it can be used in
  conjunction with imapd to create an SSL-secure IMAP server.

  An integer conversion issue was found in stunnel when using Microsoft NT
  LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication with the HTTP CONNECT tunneling method.
  With this configuration, and using stunnel in SSL client mode on a 64-bit
  system, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the stunnel process via a man-in-the-middle attack or by
  tricking a user into using a malicious proxy. (CVE-2013-1762)

  All stunnel users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
