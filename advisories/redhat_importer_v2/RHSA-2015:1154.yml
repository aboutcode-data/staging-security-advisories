  - CVE-2015-3204
summary: |
  Updated libreswan packages that fix one security issue, several bugs and
  add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Libreswan is an implementation of IPsec & IKE for Linux. IPsec is the
  Internet Protocol Security and uses strong cryptography to provide both
  authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to build
  secure tunnels through untrusted networks such as virtual private network
  (VPN).

  A flaw was discovered in the way Libreswan's IKE daemon processed certain
  IKEv1 payloads. A remote attacker could send specially crafted IKEv1
  payloads that, when processed, would lead to a denial of service (daemon
  crash). (CVE-2015-3204)

  Red Hat would like to thank Javantea for reporting this issue.

  This update fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the programs/pluto/state.h and
  programs/pluto/kernel_netlink.c files had a maximum SELinux context size
  of 257 and 1024 respectively. These restrictions set by libreswan limited
  the size of the context that can be exchanged by pluto (the IPSec daemon)
  when using a Labeled Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). The SElinux
  labels for Labeled IPsec have been extended to 4096 bytes and the
  mentioned restrictions no longer exist. (BZ#1198650)

  * On some architectures, the kernel AES_GCM IPsec algorithm did not work
  properly with acceleration drivers. On those kernels, some acceleration
  modules are added to the modprobe blacklist. However, Libreswan was
  ignoring this blacklist, leading to AES_GCM failures. This update adds
  support for the module blacklist to the libreswan packages and thus
  prevents the AES_GCM failures from occurring. (BZ#1208022)

  * An IPv6 issue has been resolved that prevented ipv6-icmp Neighbour
  Discovery from working properly once an IPsec tunnel is established (and
  one endpoint reboots). When upgrading, ensure that /etc/ipsec.conf is
  loading all /etc/ipsec.d/*conf files using the /etc/ipsec.conf "include"
  statement, or explicitly include this new configuration file in
  /etc/ipsec.conf. (BZ#1208023)

  * A FIPS self-test prevented libreswan from properly starting in FIPS mode.
  This bug has been fixed and libreswan now works in FIPS mode as expected.
  (BZ#1211146)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * A new option "seedbits=" has been added to pre-seed the Network Security
  Services (NSS) pseudo random number generator (PRNG) function with entropy
  from the /dev/random file on startup. This option is disabled by default.
  It can be enabled by setting the "seedbits=" option in the "config setup"
  section in the /etc/ipsec.conf file. (BZ#1198649)

  * The build process now runs a Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
  (CAVP) certification test on the Internet Key Exchange version 1 and 2
  (IKEv1 and IKEv2) PRF/PRF+ functions. (BZ#1213652)

  All libreswan users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
