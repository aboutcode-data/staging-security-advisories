  - CVE-2012-2370
summary: |
  Updated gtk2 packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user
  interfaces.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the X BitMap (XBM) image file loader
  in GTK+. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XBM image file
  that, when opened in an application linked against GTK+ (such as Nautilus),
  would cause the application to crash. (CVE-2012-2370)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Due to a bug in the Input Method GTK+ module, the usage of the Taiwanese
  Big5 (zh_TW.Big-5) locale led to the unexpected termination of certain
  applications, such as the GDM greeter. The bug has been fixed, and the
  Taiwanese locale no longer causes applications to terminate unexpectedly.
  (BZ#487630)

  * When a file was initially selected after the GTK+ file chooser dialog was
  opened and the Location field was visible, pressing the Enter key did not
  open the file. With this update, the initially selected file is opened
  regardless of the visibility of the Location field. (BZ#518483)

  * When a file was initially selected after the GTK+ file chooser dialog was
  opened and the Location field was visible, pressing the Enter key did not
  change into the directory. With this update, the dialog changes into the
  initially selected directory regardless of the visibility of the Location
  field. (BZ#523657)

  * Previously, the GTK Print dialog did not reflect the user-defined printer
  preferences stored in the ~/.cups/lpoptions file, such as those set in the
  Default Printer preferences panel. Consequently, the first device in the
  printer list was always set as a default printer. With this update, the
  underlying source code has been enhanced to parse the option file. As a
  result, the default values in the print dialog are set to those previously
  specified by the user. (BZ#603809)

  * The GTK+ file chooser did not properly handle saving of nameless files.
  Consequently, attempting to save a file without specifying a file name
  caused GTK+ to become unresponsive. With this update, an explicit test for
  this condition has been added into the underlying source code. As a result,
  GTK+ no longer hangs in the described scenario. (BZ#702342)

  * When using certain graphics tablets, the GTK+ library incorrectly
  translated the input coordinates. Consequently, an offset occurred between
  the position of the pen and the content drawn on the screen. This issue was
  limited to the following configuration: a Wacom tablet with input
  coordinates bound to a single monitor in a dual head configuration, drawing
  with a pen with the pressure sensitivity option enabled. With this update,
  the coordinate translation method has been changed, and the offset is no
  longer present in the described configuration. (BZ#743658)

  * Previously, performing drag and drop operations on tabs in applications
  using the GtkNotebook widget could lead to releasing the same resource
  twice. Eventually, this behavior caused the applications to terminate with
  a segmentation fault. This bug has been fixed, and the applications using
  GtkNotebook no longer terminate in the aforementioned scenario. (BZ#830901)

  All users of GTK+ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
