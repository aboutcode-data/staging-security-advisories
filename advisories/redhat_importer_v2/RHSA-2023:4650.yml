  Multicluster Engine for Kubernetes 2.2.7 images

  Multicluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components
  that are necessary for the centralized management of multiple
  Kubernetes-based clusters across data centers, public clouds, and private
  clouds.

  You can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
  clusters or to bring existing Kubernetes-based clusters under management by
  importing them. After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that
  are provided by the engine to distribute configuration based on placement
  policy.

  * CVE-2023-3089 openshift: OCP & FIPS mode
  * CVE-2023-37903 vm2: custom inspect function allows attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code
