  - CVE-2015-1819
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation
  of various XML standards.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the libxml2 library parsed
  certain XML files. An attacker could provide a specially crafted XML file
  that, when parsed by an application using libxml2, could cause that
  application to use an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2015-1819)

  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  This update fixes an error that occurred when running a test case for the
  serialization of HTML documents. (BZ#1004513)

  Users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The desktop must be
  restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
