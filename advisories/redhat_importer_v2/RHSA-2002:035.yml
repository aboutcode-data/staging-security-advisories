  - CVE-2002-0081
summary: "Updated PHP packages are available to fix vulnerabilities in the functions\nthat parse\
  \ multipart MIME data, which are used when uploading files\nthrough forms.\n\nThis revised\
  \ advisory contains updated packages for Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1,\nand 7.2.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embeddable\
  \ scripting language.  A number of flaws have been\nfound in the way PHP handles multipart/form-data\
  \ POST requests.  Each of\nthese flaws could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on\
  \ the remote\nsystem.\n\nPHP 3.10-3.18 contains a broken boundary check (hard to exploit)\
  \ and an\narbitrary heap overflow (easy to exploit).  These versions of PHP were\nshipped\
  \ with Red Hat Linux 6.2.\n   \nPHP 4.0.1-4.0.3pl1 contains a broken boundary check (hard\
  \ to exploit) and a\nheap-off-by-one (easy to exploit).  These versions of PHP were shipped\
  \ with \nRed Hat Linux 7.0.\n\nPHP 4.0.2-4.0.5 contains two broken boundary checks (one very\
  \ easy and one\nhard to exploit).  These versions of PHP were shipped with Red Hat Linux\n\
  7.1 and as erratas to 7.0.\n\nPHP 4.0.6-4.0.7RC2 contains a broken boundary check (very easy\
  \ to exploit).\nThese versions of PHP were shipped with Red Hat Linux 7.2\n      \nThe Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0081\
  \ to this issue.\n\nIf you are running PHP 4.0.3 or above, one way to work around these bugs\
  \ is\nto disable the fileupload support within your php.ini file (by setting\nfile_uploads\
  \ = Off).\n\nAll users of PHP are advised to immediately upgrade to these errata\npackages\
  \ which close these vulnerabilities.\n\nA previous version of this erratum included a version\
  \ of the MySQL\nextension which was compiled with an incorrect default pathname for the\n\
  socket used to connect to database servers residing on the local host.\n\nThis setting corresponds\
  \ to the mysql.default_socket setting in the\n/etc/php.ini file, and can also be corrected\
  \ there."
