summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 includes a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4
  kernel. These custom kernel packages include support for network
  namespaces, this support is required to facilitate advanced OpenStack
  Networking deployments.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A flaw was found in the tcp_read_sock() function in the Linux kernel's
  IPv4 TCP/IP protocol suite implementation in the way socket buffers (skb)
  were handled. A local, unprivileged user could trigger this issue via a
  call to splice(), leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2013-2128,
  Moderate)

  * Information leak flaws in the Linux kernel could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to leak kernel memory to user-space. (CVE-2012-6548,
  CVE-2013-2634, CVE-2013-2635, CVE-2013-3222, CVE-2013-3224, CVE-2013-3225,
  Low)

  * An information leak was found in the Linux kernel's POSIX signals
  implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to bypass
  the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.
  (CVE-2013-0914, Low)

  * A format string flaw was found in the ext3_msg() function in the Linux
  kernel's ext3 file system implementation. A local user who is able to mount
  an ext3 file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1848, Low)

  * A format string flaw was found in the b43_do_request_fw() function in the
  Linux kernel's b43 driver implementation. A local user who is able to
  specify the "fwpostfix" b43 module parameter could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service or, potentially, escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2013-2852, Low)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ftrace
  and function tracer implementations. A local user who has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
  capability could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2013-3301, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2013-2852.

  More information on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 kernel packages upon
  which these custom kernel packages are based is available in

  All Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 users deploying the OpenStack Networking service
  are advised to install these updated packages.
