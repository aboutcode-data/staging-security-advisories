  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java
  applications, which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss
  Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

  It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted host name from
  an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially
  crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

  The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
  Product Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
