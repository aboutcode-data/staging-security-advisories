  - CVE-2012-3422
  - CVE-2012-3423
summary: |
  Updated icedtea-web packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an
  implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It
  also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the
  plug-in and Web Start implementations.

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the IcedTea-Web plug-in.
  Visiting a malicious web page could possibly cause a web browser using the
  IcedTea-Web plug-in to crash, disclose a portion of its memory, or execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-3422)

  It was discovered that the IcedTea-Web plug-in incorrectly assumed all
  strings received from the browser were NUL terminated. When using the
  plug-in with a web browser that does not NUL terminate strings, visiting a
  web page containing a Java applet could possibly cause the browser to
  crash, disclose a portion of its memory, or execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2012-3423)

  Red Hat would like to thank Chamal De Silva for reporting the CVE-2012-3422
  issue.

  This erratum also upgrades IcedTea-Web to version 1.2.1. Refer to the NEWS
  file, linked to in the References, for further information.

  All IcedTea-Web users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues. Web browsers using the IcedTea-Web browser plug-in
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
