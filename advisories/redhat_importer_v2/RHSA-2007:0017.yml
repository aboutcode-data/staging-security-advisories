  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  portable document format (PDF).

  A cross site scripting flaw was found in the way the Adobe Reader Plugin
  processes certain malformed URLs. A malicious web page could inject
  arbitrary javascript into the browser session which could possibly lead to
  a cross site scripting attack. (CVE-2007-0045)

  Two arbitrary code execution flaws were found in the way Adobe Reader
  processes malformed document files. It may be possible to execute arbitrary
  code on a victim's machine if the victim opens a malicious PDF file.

  All users of Acrobat Reader are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain Acrobat Reader version 7.0.9 and are not vulnerable
