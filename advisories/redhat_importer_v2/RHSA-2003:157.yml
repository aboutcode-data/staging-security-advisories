summary: "Updated libpng packages that fix various buffer overflow vulnerabilities\nare available\
  \ for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.\n\nThe libpng package contains a library\
  \ of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format\
  \ files. PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format. \n\nVersions of libpng\
  \ prior to 1.0.14 contain a buffer overflow in the\nprogressive reader when the PNG datastream\
  \ contains more IDAT data than\nindicated by the IHDR chunk. Such deliberately malformed datastreams\
  \ would\ncrash applications that are linked to libpng and that use the progressive\nreading\
  \ feature. Mozilla is such an application. (CAN-2002-0728)\n\nPackages within Red Hat Linux,\
  \ such as Mozilla, make use of the shared\nlibpng library. Therefore, all users are advised\
  \ to upgrade to the errata\npackages, which contain libpng 1.0.14. Libpng 1.0.14 is not vulnerable\
  \ to\nthis issue and contains fixes for other bugs, including a number of memory\nleaks and\
  \ another potential buffer overflow (CAN-2002-0660) \n\nUnpatched versions of libpng 1.2.1\
  \ and earlier do not correctly calculate\noffsets, which leads to a buffer overflow and the\
  \ possibility of arbitrary\ncode execution.  This could be exploited by an attacker creating\
  \ a\ncarefully crafted PNG file, which could execute arbitrary code when the\nvictim views\
  \ it. (CAN-2002-1363)\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to the errata packages containing\
  \ libpng\n1.0.14 with backported patches correcting these vulnerabilities."
