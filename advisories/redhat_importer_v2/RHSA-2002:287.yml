  - CVE-2002-1336
summary: "Updated VNC packages are available to fix a challenge replay attack that is\npresent\
  \ in the VNC server.\n\nVNC is a tool for providing a remote graphical user interface.\n\n\
  The VNC DES authentication scheme is implemented using a challenge-response\narchitecture,\
  \ producing a random and different challenge for each\nauthentication attempt.\n\nA bug in\
  \ the function for generating the random challenge caused the random\nseed to be reset to\
  \ the current time on every authentication attempt.\nAs a result, two authentication attempts\
  \ within the same second could\nreceive the same challenge. An eavesdropper could exploit\
  \ this\nvulnerability by replaying the response, thereby gaining authentication.\n\nAll users\
  \ of VNC are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain an updated version\
  \ and are not vulnerable to this issue. \n\nNote that when using VNC on an untrusted network,\
  \ always make sure to\ntunnel the VNC protocol through a secure, authenticated channel such\
  \ as\nSSH.  Instructions on how to tunnel VNC through SSH are provided at the\nfollowing URL:\
  \ http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/sshvnc.html"
