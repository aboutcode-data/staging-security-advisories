summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
  add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
  Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
  Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  It was discovered that, under certain circumstances, glibc's getaddrinfo()
  function would send DNS queries to random file descriptors. An attacker
  could potentially use this flaw to send DNS queries to unintended
  recipients, resulting in information disclosure or data loss due to the
  application encountering corrupted data. (CVE-2013-7423)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way glibc's gethostbyname_r() and
  other related functions computed the size of a buffer when passed a
  misaligned buffer as input. An attacker able to make an application call
  any of these functions with a misaligned buffer could use this flaw to
  crash the application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  permissions of the user running the application. (CVE-2015-1781)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw and a stack overflow flaw were found in
  glibc's swscanf() function. An attacker able to make an application call
  the swscanf() function could use these flaws to crash that application or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2015-1472, CVE-2015-1473)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in glibc's _IO_wstr_overflow() function. An attacker able to make an
  application call this function could use this flaw to crash that
  application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user running the application. (BZ#1195762)

  A flaw was found in the way glibc's fnmatch() function processed certain
  malformed patterns. An attacker able to make an application call this
  function could use this flaw to crash that application. (BZ#1197730)

  The CVE-2015-1781 issue was discovered by Arjun Shankar of Red Hat.

  These updated glibc packages also include numerous bug fixes and one
  enhancement. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. For information on the most significant of these changes, users
  are directed to the following article on the Red Hat Customer Portal:

  https://access.redhat.com/articles/2050743

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
