  - CVE-2015-3183
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
  and extensible web server.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
  responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
  these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
  differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
  HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

  All httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd service will be restarted automatically.
