  - CVE-2011-1486
summary: |
  Updated libvirt packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
  virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In
  addition, libvirt provides tools for remotely managing virtualized systems.

  A flaw was found in the way libvirtd handled error reporting for concurrent
  connections. A remote attacker able to establish read-only connections to
  libvirtd on a server could use this flaw to crash libvirtd. (CVE-2011-1486)

  All libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, libvirtd must be restarted ("service libvirtd restart")
  for this update to take effect.
