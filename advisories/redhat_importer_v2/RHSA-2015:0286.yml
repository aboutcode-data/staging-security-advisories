summary: |
  This is the final notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support (EUS). This notification applies only to
  those customers subscribed to the Extended Update Support (EUS) channel for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Update Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 was retired on
  March 3, 2015, and support is no longer provided. Accordingly, Red Hat will
  no longer provide updated packages, including Critical impact security
  patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS
  after March 3, 2015. In addition, technical support through Red Hat's
  Global Support Services will no longer be provided after this date.

  We encourage customers to migrate from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 to a
  more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a benefit of the Red
  Hat subscription model, customers can use their active subscriptions to
  entitle any system on any currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  release.
