summary: |
  This is the 6-Month notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support (EUS). This notification applies only to
  those customers subscribed to the Extended Update Support channel for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Update Support (EUS) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 will be
  retired as of February 28, 2015, and support will no longer be provided.
  Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including
  Critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS after February 28, 2015. In addition, technical
  support through Red Hat's Global Support Services will no longer be
  provided after this date.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.4 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a
  benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on any currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux release.
