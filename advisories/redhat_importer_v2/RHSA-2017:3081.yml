summary: |
  An update for tomcat is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)

  * Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Tomcat where if a servlet context was configured with readonly=false and HTTP PUT requests were allowed, an attacker could upload a JSP file to that context and achieve code execution. (CVE-2017-12615, CVE-2017-12617)

  * A vulnerability was discovered in Tomcat where the CORS Filter did not send a "Vary: Origin" HTTP header. This potentially allowed sensitive data to be leaked to other visitors through both client-side and server-side caches. (CVE-2017-7674)
