summary: |
  JBoss Operations Network 3.1.1, which fixes one security issue, several
  bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution
  that provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor
  JBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss ON 3.1.1 release serves as a replacement for JBoss ON 3.1.0, and
  includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss ON 3.1.1
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes. The
  Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that JBoss Web did not handle large numbers of parameters and
  large parameter values efficiently. A remote attacker could make JBoss Web
  use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP request containing a
  large number of parameters or large parameter values. This update
  introduces limits on the number of parameters and headers processed per
  request to address this issue. The default limit is 512 for parameters and
  128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by setting the
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "jbossas/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2012-0022)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON
  installation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,
  the JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.1.1.
