summary: "Updated tetex packages that resolve security issues are now available for Red\nHat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by\
  \ the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nThe tetex packages (teTeX) contain an implementation\
  \ of TeX for Linux or\nUNIX systems. \n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the Gfx::doImage\
  \ function of Xpdf which\nalso affects teTeX due to a shared codebase. An attacker could construct\
  \ a\ncarefully crafted PDF file that could cause teTeX to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary\
  \ code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\
  \ assigned the name CAN-2004-1125 to\nthis issue.\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the\
  \ Decrypt::makeFileKey2 function of\nXpdf which also affects teTeX due to a shared codebase.\
  \ An attacker could\nconstruct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause teTeX to crash\
  \ or\npossibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0064 to\nthis issue.\n\nUsers should\
  \ update to these erratum packages which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues."
