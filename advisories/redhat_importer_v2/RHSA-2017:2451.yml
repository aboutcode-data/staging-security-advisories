  - CVE-2017-7543
summary: |
  An update for openstack-neutron is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A race-condition flaw was discovered in openstack-neutron where, following a minor overcloud update, neutron security groups were disabled. Specifically, the following were reset to 0: net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables and net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables. The race was only triggered by an update, at which point an attacker could access exposed tenant VMs and network resources. (CVE-2017-7543)

  This issue was discovered by Paul Needle (Red Hat).
