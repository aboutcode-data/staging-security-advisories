summary: |
  Updated ethereal packages are available which fix various security issues.

  Ethereal is a package designed for monitoring network traffic on your
  system.  Several security issues have been found in the Ethereal packages
  distributed with Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3.

  A buffer overflow in Ethereal 0.9.5 and earlier allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via the ISIS
  dissector. (CAN-2002-0834)

  Buffer overflows in Ethereal 0.9.4 and earlier allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via (1) the BGP
  dissector, or (2) the WCP dissector. (CAN-2002-0821)

  Ethereal 0.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via the (1) SOCKS, (2)
  RSVP, (3) AFS, or (4) LMP dissectors, which can be caused to core
  dump. (CAN-2002-0822)

  Users of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal
  version 0.9.6 which is not vulnerable to these issues.
