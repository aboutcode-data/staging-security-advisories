  - CVE-2014-3581
summary: |
  Updated httpd24-httpd packages that fix two security issues and one bug
  are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
  and extensible web server.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_cache httpd
  module handled Content-Type headers. A malicious HTTP server could cause
  the httpd child process to crash when the Apache HTTP server was configured
  to proxy to a server with caching enabled. (CVE-2014-3581)

  A flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when
  processing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could use
  Trailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header processing was
  performed by other modules. This could, for example, lead to a bypass of
  header restrictions defined with mod_headers. (CVE-2013-5704)

  Note: With this update, httpd has been modified to not merge HTTP Trailer
  headers with other HTTP request headers. A newly introduced configuration
  directive MergeTrailers can be used to re-enable the old method of
  processing Trailer headers, which also re-introduces the aforementioned
  flaw.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, the mod_proxy_wstunnel module failed to set up an
  SSL connection when configured to use a back end server using the "wss:"
  URL scheme, causing proxied connections to fail. In these updated packages,
  SSL is used when proxying to "wss:" back end servers. (BZ#1141950)

  All httpd24-httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  the updated packages, the httpd24-httpd service will be restarted
  automatically.
