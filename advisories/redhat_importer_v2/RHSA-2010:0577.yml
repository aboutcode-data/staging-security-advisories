summary: |
  Updated freetype packages that fix various security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
  manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
  efficiently. These packages provide both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2 font
  engines.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font engine
  processed font files. If a user loaded a carefully-crafted font file with
  an application linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to
  crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2010-2500)

  Several buffer overflow flaws were found in the FreeType demo applications.
  If a user loaded a carefully-crafted font file with a demo application, it
  could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-2527,
  CVE-2010-2541)

  Red Hat would like to thank Robert Swiecki of the Google Security Team for
  the discovery of the CVE-2010-2500 and CVE-2010-2527 issues.

  Note: All of the issues in this erratum only affect the FreeType 2 font
  engine.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
  (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
