  - CVE-2008-1380
summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix a security bug are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

  A flaw was found in the processing of malformed JavaScript content. A web
  page containing such malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2008-1380)

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches that correct these issues.
