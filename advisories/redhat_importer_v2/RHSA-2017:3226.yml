  - CVE-2016-2121
summary: |
  An update for redis is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A permissions flaw was found in redis, which sets weak permissions on certain files and directories that could potentially contain sensitive information. A local, unprivileged user could possibly use this flaw to access unauthorized system information. (CVE-2016-2121)

  This issue was discovered by Honza Horak (Red Hat) and Remi Collet (Red Hat).
