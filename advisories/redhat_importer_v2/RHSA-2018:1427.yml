summary: |
  The docker-latest package has been deprecated in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras channel.

  Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that runs virtually anywhere.

  The docker-latest package provides a version of Docker that iterates outside of the release cadence of Red Hat's container platforms.

  The docker-latest package will no longer be updated through the Extras channel. Instead, Red Hat customers are advised to use the docker package, which continues to be updated and fully supported.
