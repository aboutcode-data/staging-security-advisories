summary: |
  Updated tomcat5 packages that fix multiple security issues and two bugs are
  now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  JBoss Enterprise Web Server includes the Tomcat Native library, providing
  Apache Portable Runtime (APR) support for Tomcat. References in this text
  to APR refer to the Tomcat Native implementation, not any other apr
  package.

  This update includes bug fixes as documented in JBPAPP-4873 and
  JBPAPP-6133. It also resolves the following security issues:

  Multiple flaws were found in the way Tomcat handled HTTP DIGEST
  authentication. These flaws weakened the Tomcat HTTP DIGEST authentication
  implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of HTTP BASIC
  authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to perform session
  replay attacks. (CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-5062, CVE-2011-5063,
  CVE-2011-5064)

  A flaw was found in the way the Coyote (org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProcessor)
  and APR (org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpAprProcessor) Tomcat AJP (Apache JServ
  Protocol) connectors processed certain POST requests. An attacker could
  send a specially-crafted request that would cause the connector to treat
  the message body as a new request. This allows arbitrary AJP messages to be
  injected, possibly allowing an attacker to bypass a web application's
  authentication checks and gain access to information they would otherwise
  be unable to access. The JK (org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler)
  connector is used by default when the APR libraries are not present. The JK
  connector is not affected by this flaw. (CVE-2011-3190)

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible
  to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  cause Tomcat to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP
  request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash
  value. This update introduces a limit on the number of parameters processed
  per request to mitigate this issue. The default limit is 512 for parameters
  and 128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by setting the
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties.
  (CVE-2011-4858)

  It was found that Tomcat did not handle large numbers of parameters and
  large parameter values efficiently. A remote attacker could make Tomcat use
  an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP request containing a
  large number of parameters or large parameter values. This update
  introduces limits on the number of parameters and headers processed per
  request to address this issue. Refer to the CVE-2011-4858 description for
  information about the org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties.
  (CVE-2012-0022)

  A flaw was found in the Tomcat MemoryUserDatabase. If a runtime exception
  occurred when creating a new user with a JMX client, that user's password
  was logged to Tomcat log files. Note: By default, only administrators have
  access to such log files. (CVE-2011-2204)

  A flaw was found in the way Tomcat handled sendfile request attributes
  when using the HTTP APR or NIO (Non-Blocking I/O) connector. A malicious
  web application running on a Tomcat instance could use this flaw to bypass
  security manager restrictions and gain access to files it would otherwise
  be unable to access, or possibly terminate the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  The HTTP NIO connector is used by default in JBoss Enterprise Web Server.
  (CVE-2011-2526)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858, and the
  Apache Tomcat project for reporting CVE-2011-2526. oCERT acknowledges
  Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4858.

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.
