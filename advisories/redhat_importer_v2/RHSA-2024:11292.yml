summary: |
  Updated images that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation 4.16.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 from Red Hat Container Registry.

  Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is software-defined storage integrated with and optimized for the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation. Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is a highly scalable, production-grade persistent storage for stateful applications running in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. In addition to persistent storage, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation provisions a multi-cloud data management service with an
  S3 compatible API.

  Security Fix(es):

  * cross-spawn: regular expression denial of service (CVE-2024-21538)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug fixes:

  Previously, the `PrometheusDuplicateTimestamps` warning was seen in Prometheus that indicated that metrics with same timestamp but with different values are encountered. This was because the nodejs report generated default metrics that overlapped with those from the core report. With this fix, a new regisry is created to collect all the default metrics of nodejs and hence resolving the warning.

  Previously, Ceph S3 object stores in OpenShift Data Foundation external mode needed to rotate certificates each time the RADOS Gateway (RGW) rotated. With this fix, well-known certificate authorities (CAs) are used to attempt the authentication of Ceph RGW daemons. The well-known CAs are determined based on Red Hat base container image’s certificates’ RPM package. This enables OpenShift Data Foundation to continue to operate in a healthy status.
