summary: "Updated ImageMagick packages that correct several security issues are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 3, 4, and 5. \n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nImageMagick is an image\
  \ display and manipulation tool for the X Window\nSystem that can read and write multiple\
  \ image formats.\n\nSeveral heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in ImageMagick. If\
  \ a\nvictim opened a specially crafted DCM or XWD file, an attacker could\npotentially execute\
  \ arbitrary code on the victim's machine. (CVE-2007-1797)\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws\
  \ were found in ImageMagick's parsing of XCF\nand DCM files. Attempting to process a specially-crafted\
  \ input file in\nthese formats could cause ImageMagick to enter an infinite loop.\n(CVE-2007-4985)\n\
  \nSeveral integer overflow flaws were found in ImageMagick. If a victim\nopened a specially-crafted\
  \ DCM, DIB, XBM, XCF or XWD file, an attacker\ncould potentially execute arbitrary code with\
  \ the privileges of the user\nrunning ImageMagick. (CVE-2007-4986)\n\nAn integer overflow\
  \ flaw was found in ImageMagick's DIB parsing code. If a\nvictim opened a specially-crafted\
  \ DIB file, an attacker could potentially\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\
  \ user running ImageMagick.\n(CVE-2007-4988)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found\
  \ in the way ImageMagick parsed\nXCF files. If a specially-crafted XCF image was opened, ImageMagick\
  \ could\nbe made to overwrite heap memory beyond the bounds of its allocated memory.\nThis\
  \ could, potentially, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the\nmachine running\
  \ ImageMagick. (CVE-2008-1096)\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in ImageMagick's\
  \ processing of\ncertain malformed PCX images. If a victim opened a specially-crafted PCX\n\
  file, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code on the victim's\nmachine. (CVE-2008-1097)\n\
  \nAll users of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported\
  \ patches to correct these issues."
