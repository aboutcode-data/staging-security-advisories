summary: |
  This is the day of notification of the End Of Life (EOL) plans for the following versions of Red Hat Satellite 5:

  * Red Hat Satellite 5.6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

  After March 31, 2017, as per the life-cycle support policy for Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat will discontinue technical support services as well as software maintenance services for all Red Hat Satellite and Proxy versions 5.6 or older on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. The listed versions will exit the existing Limited Maintenance Release phase. This means that new bug fixes, security updates, and product enhancements will no longer be provided for the following product versions:

  * Red Hat Satellite 5.6 and Proxy 5.6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

  Details of the Satellite support policy can be found at:

  https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite/

  Notes:

  1) Red Hat will continue to support Red Hat Satellite and Proxy on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later.

  2) Red Hat Satellite 5.6 and Proxy 5.6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will be EOL on March 31 2017.

  How to proceed:

  * All affected Satellite and Proxy users must plan to upgrade to a newer version prior to March 31 2017.

  * Find an overview of various aspects for this upcoming EOL date at

  https://access.redhat.com/articles/2868391

  * If you have a Technical Account Manager, contact that person immediately to discuss upgrade plans.

  * Otherwise, contact Red Hat support for assistance at

  https://www.redhat.com/en/services/support

  * Alternatively, Red Hat Consulting can be engaged to assist with a smooth migration, see https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting

  More information on Red Hat Consulting for Satellite can be found in the PDF document linked to in the References section.

  It is critical to ensure you have a plan to migrate to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 prior to March 31, 2017.

  Customers who choose to continue to deploy on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will continue to have access via Red Hat Network (RHN) to the following content as part of their active Red Hat Satellite subscription:

  * Previously released bug fixes, security updates, and product enhancements.

  * Red Hat Knowledgebase and other content (whitepapers, reference architectures, etc.) found in the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  * All Red Hat Satellite documentation.

  Customers are strongly encouraged to take the advantage of the upgrade benefits of their active Red Hat Satellite subscription, and migrate to an active version of Red Hat Satellite such as version 5.6 or 5.7.
