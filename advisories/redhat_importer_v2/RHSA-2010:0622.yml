summary: |
  Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix multiple security issues and two
  bugs are now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not
  validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card
  driver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to
  dereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of
  service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
  their privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)

  It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be
  forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses
  controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
  the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on
  the host. (CVE-2010-0429)

  It was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers
  provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest
  user could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid
  pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,
  resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the
  host. (CVE-2010-0431)

  A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the
  index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO
  initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the
  guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
  host. (CVE-2010-2784)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Hypervisor was run on a system that has a processor with the
  Intel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
  to trick the host into emulating a certain instruction, which could crash
  the host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)

  A flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker
  could trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,
  preventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.
  (CVE-2010-2811)

  These updated packages provide updated components that include fixes for
  security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for avahi issues
  CVE-2009-0758 and CVE-2010-2244; freetype issues CVE-2010-1797,
  CVE-2010-2498, CVE-2010-2499, CVE-2010-2500, CVE-2010-2519, CVE-2010-2527,
  and CVE-2010-2541; kernel issues CVE-2010-1084, CVE-2010-2066,
  CVE-2010-2070, CVE-2010-2226, CVE-2010-2248, CVE-2010-2521, and
  CVE-2010-2524; and openldap issues CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212.

  These updated rhev-hypervisor packages also fix two bugs. Documentation for
  these bug fixes will be available shortly from
  http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html

  As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
  fixes from the KVM update RHSA-2010:0627 have been included in this update.
  Also included are the bug fixes from the VDSM update RHSA-2010:0628.

  VDSM: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0628.html

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to these updated rhev-hypervisor packages, which resolve these
  issues.
