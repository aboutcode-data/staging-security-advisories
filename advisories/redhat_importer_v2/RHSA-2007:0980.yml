summary: "Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSeaMonkey is an open source Web browser,\
  \ advanced email and newsgroup\nclient, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.\n\nSeveral flaws\
  \ were found in the way in which SeaMonkey processed certain\nmalformed web content. A web\
  \ page containing malicious content could cause\nSeaMonkey to crash or potentially execute\
  \ arbitrary code as the user\nrunning SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-5338, CVE-2007-5339, CVE-2007-5340)\n\
  \nSeveral flaws were found in the way in which SeaMonkey displayed malformed\nweb content.\
  \ A web page containing specially-crafted content could\npotentially trick a user into surrendering\
  \ sensitive information. \n(CVE-2007-1095, CVE-2007-3844, CVE-2007-3511, CVE-2007-5334)\n\n\
  A flaw was found in the SeaMonkey sftp protocol handler. A malicious web\npage could access\
  \ data from a remote sftp site, possibly stealing sensitive\nuser data. (CVE-2007-5337)\n\n\
  A request-splitting flaw was found in the way in which SeaMonkey generates\na digest authentication\
  \ request. If a user opened a specially-crafted URL,\nit was possible to perform cross-site\
  \ scripting attacks, web cache\npoisoning, or other, similar exploits. (CVE-2007-2292)\n\n\
  Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain backported\
  \ patches that correct these issues."
