summary: |
  Updated openssh packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure Shell) protocol implementation. These
  packages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
  server.

  A flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled PAM authentication when using
  privilege separation. An attacker with valid credentials on the system and
  able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using
  a different flaw could use this flaw to authenticate as other users.
  (CVE-2015-6563)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in OpenSSH. An attacker able to fully
  compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different
  flaw could possibly cause sshd to crash or execute arbitrary code with
  root privileges. (CVE-2015-6564)

  It was discovered that the OpenSSH sshd daemon did not check the list of
  keyboard-interactive authentication methods for duplicates. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to bypass the MaxAuthTries limit, making it
  easier to perform password guessing attacks. (CVE-2015-5600)

  It was found that the OpenSSH ssh-agent, a program to hold private keys
  used for public key authentication, was vulnerable to password guessing
  attacks. An attacker able to connect to the agent could use this flaw to
  conduct a brute-force attack to unlock keys in the ssh-agent. (BZ#1238238)

  This update fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the sshd_config(5) man page was misleading and could thus
  confuse the user. This update improves the man page text to clearly
  describe the AllowGroups feature. (BZ#1150007)

  * The limit for the function for restricting the number of files listed using the wildcard character (*) that prevents the Denial of Service (DoS) for both server and client was previously set too low. Consequently, the user reaching the limit was prevented from listing a directory with a large number of files over Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). This update increases the aforementioned limit, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1160377)

  * When the ForceCommand option with a pseudoterminal was used and the
  MaxSession option was set to "2", multiplexed SSH connections did not work
  as expected. After the user attempted to open a second multiplexed
  connection, the attempt failed if the first connection was still open. This
  update modifies OpenSSH to issue only one audit message per session, and
  the user is thus able to open two multiplexed connections in this
  situation. (BZ#1199112)

  * The ssh-copy-id utility failed if the account on the remote server did
  not use an sh-like shell. Remote commands have been modified to run in an
  sh-like shell, and ssh-copy-id now works also with non-sh-like shells.
  (BZ#1201758)

  * Due to a race condition between auditing messages and answers when using
  ControlMaster multiplexing, one session in the shared connection randomly
  and unexpectedly exited the connection. This update fixes the race
  condition in the auditing code, and multiplexing connections now work as
  expected even with a number of sessions created at once. (BZ#1240613)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * As not all Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers possess
  a default schema, as expected by the ssh-ldap-helper program, this update
  provides the user with an ability to adjust the LDAP query to get public
  keys from servers with a different schema, while the default functionality
  stays untouched. (BZ#1201753)

  * With this enhancement update, the administrator is able to set
  permissions for files uploaded using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
  (BZ#1197989)

  * This update provides the LDAP schema in LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) format as a complement to the old schema previously accepted
  by OpenLDAP. (BZ#1184938)

  * With this update, the user can selectively disable the Generic Security
  Services API (GSSAPI) key exchange algorithms as any normal key exchange.
  (BZ#1253062)

  Users of openssh are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements.
