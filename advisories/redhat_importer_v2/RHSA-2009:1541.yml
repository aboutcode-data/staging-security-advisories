  - CVE-2009-3547
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following
  functions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and
  pipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer could
  be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
  reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
  privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported
  patch to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this update
  to take effect.
