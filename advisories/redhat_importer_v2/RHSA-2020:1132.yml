aliases:
  - CVE-2018-20852
  - CVE-2019-16056
summary: |
  An update for python3 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language, which includes modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. This package provides the "python3" executable: the reference interpreter for the Python language, version 3. The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3-libs package, which should be installed automatically along with python3. The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the python3-tkinter and python3-test packages.

  Security Fix(es):

  * python: Cookie domain check returns incorrect results (CVE-2018-20852)

  * python: email.utils.parseaddr wrongly parses email addresses (CVE-2019-16056)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
