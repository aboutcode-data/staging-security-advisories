  - CVE-2002-0875
summary: |
  Updated fam packages that fix an information disclosure bug are now available.

  FAM, the File Alteration Monitor, provides a daemon and an API which
  applications can use for notification of changes in specific files or
  directories.

  A bug has been found in the way FAM handles group permissions.  It is
  possible that a local unprivileged user can use a flaw in FAM's group
  handling to discover the names of files which are only viewable to users in
  the 'root' group.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0875 to this issue.  This
  issue only affects the version of FAM shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  2.1.

  Users of FAM should update to these updated packages which contain
  backported patches and are not vulnerable to this issue.
