  - CVE-2014-3703
summary: |
  Updated openstack-packstack packages that fix one security issue, several
  bugs, and add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  PackStack is a command-line utility that uses Puppet modules to support
  rapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection.
  PackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof-of-concept
  installations and more complex multi-node installations.

  It was discovered that the nova.conf configuration generated by PackStack
  did not correctly set the libvirt_vif_driver configuration option if the
  Open vSwitch (OVS) monolithic plug-in was not used. This could result in
  deployments defaulting to having the firewall disabled unless the nova
  configuration was manually modified after PackStack was started.
  (CVE-2014-3703)

  This issue was discovered by Yair Fried of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * This update fixes a dependency issue between the openstack-cinder-api and
  openstack-cinder-backup services. The openstack-cinder-backup service is
  now guaranteed to be started during PackStack installation. (BZ#1075609)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * This update enables mysqld performance improvement if users add the
  following configuration options to the /etc/my.cnf file:

  innodb_buffer_pool_size = (10-20% of available memory)
  innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
  innodb_file_per_table

  These improvements are expected to be the default settings in the next
  release. (BZ#1078999)

  * With this update, PackStack now consistently performs the installation of
  the sos, sos-plugins-openstack, and rhos-collector packages on all hosts.
  (BZ#1131619)

  All openstack-packstack users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
