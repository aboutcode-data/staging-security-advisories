  - CVE-2010-2241
summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Directory Server and related packages that fix one security
  issue, multiple bugs, and add enhancements are now available as Red Hat
  Directory Server 8.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server. The
  redhat-ds-base package includes the LDAP server and command line utilities
  for server administration.

  Directory Server setup scripts created cache files, containing passwords
  for the Directory and Administration Server administrative accounts, with
  weak file permissions. A local user could use this flaw to obtain
  authentication credentials for the administrative accounts. (CVE-2010-2241)

  This update also adds the following enhancements:

  * Entry USN - The Entry USN Plug-in provides a way for LDAP clients to know
  that something in the database has changed by generating a global update
  sequence number (USN) for every write operation.

  * Linked Attributes - The new Linked Attributes Plug-in uses the DN value
  of a known attribute to trace its way to the referenced entry, and then it
  adds a reciprocal value, pointing back to the first entry.

  * Bitwise Search - This release adds support for bit field values in LDAP
  searches.

  * Dereference Control - This release adds server support for the
  dereference control in LDAP searches. A dereferencing search tracks back
  over cross-references in an entry and returns information about the
  referenced entry.

  * PAM Pass-through Plug-in - The PAM PTA plug-in allows Directory Server to
  leverage a network's existing PAM service to authenticate users.

  * SMD5 Password Storage Scheme - Passwords can now be stored with the
  salted MD5 password hash.

  * Syntax Checking - A new syntax validation plug-in verifies that the value
  given for an attribute in an operation matches the required syntax for that
  attribute.

  * Anonymous Resource Limits - A new server configuration attribute enables
  the Directory Server to apply resource limits to anonymous binds.

  * Anonymous Access Switch - A new server configuration attribute tells the
  Directory Server to disable anonymous binds for added security.

  * Secure Binds Switch - A new server configuration attribute tells the
  Directory Server to require a secure connection of some kind for any simple
  binds.

  * SSF Restrictions - A new server configuration attribute allows
  administrators to set a minimum Security Strength Factor (SSF) for all
  connections to the server, which can require a secure connection.

  * Mixed SASL/TLS Connections - Now, the server can have both SASL and TLS
  configured.

  * Setting Plug-in Load Orders - A new plug-in configuration attribute sets
  the load order preference for the plug-in, anywhere from 1 to 99. This
  effectively sets the load order for plug-ins of the same type.

  * Named Pipe Log Script - A new directory script allows logging data to be
  sent to a named pipe instead of the standard server logs.

  * Simple Paged Results - This release adds server support for results of
  LDAP searches to be broken into pages.

  * New Matching Rule and Attribute Syntaxes - This release adds support for
  several new matching rules and 11 new attribute syntaxes.

  These packages also contain many bug fixes for major features in Red Hat
  Directory Server, including replication, synchronization, setup and
  migration, command line tools, the Java console, and the Administration
  Server. Refer to the Red Hat Directory Server 8.2 Release Notes for further
  information:

  http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/8.2/rel-notes/html

  All Red Hat Directory Server users should upgrade to Red Hat Directory
  Server 8.2, which resolves these issues and adds these enhancements.
