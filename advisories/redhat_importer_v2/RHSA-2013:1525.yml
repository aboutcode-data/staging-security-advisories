  - CVE-2013-4428
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-glance packages provide a service (code name Glance) that
  acts as a registry for virtual machine images.

  A flaw was found in the Glance download_image policy enforcement for cached
  system images. When an image was previously cached by an authorized
  download, any authenticated user able to determine the image by its UUID
  could download that image, bypassing the download_image policy. Only setups
  making use of the download_image policy were affected. (CVE-2013-4428)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this
  issue. The OpenStack Project acknowledges Stuart McLaren from HP as the
  original reporter.

  These updated openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream
  version 2013.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous
  version. (BZ#1021640)

  All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the running Glance services must be manually restarted (using
  "service [service name] restart") for this update to take effect.
