summary: |
  An update for the Apache Commons Fileupload and JBoss Web components that
  fixes two security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal
  for Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Web Server is an enterprise ready web server designed for medium and
  large applications, and is based on Tomcat. JBoss Web Server provides
  organizations with a single deployment platform for Java Server Pages (JSP)
  and Java Servlet technologies, PHP, and CGI. It uses a genuine high
  performance hybrid technology that incorporates the best of the most recent
  OS technologies for processing high volume data, while keeping all the
  reference Java specifications.

  Apache Commons FileUpload package makes it easy to add robust,
  high-performance, file upload capability to servlets and web applications.

  It was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in
  which at least one request contained either multiple content-length
  headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding
  header, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.
  (CVE-2013-4286)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload,
  which is embedded in the JBoss Web component of JBoss EAP bundled with
  JBoss BRMS and BPM Suite, handled small-sized buffers used by
  MultipartStream. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create a
  malformed Content-Type header for a multipart request, causing JBoss Web to
  enter an infinite loop when processing such an incoming request.
  (CVE-2014-0050)

  All users of the affected products as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this update.
