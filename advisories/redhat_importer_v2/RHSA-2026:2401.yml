summary: "An update for brotli is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update\
  \ Support.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of\
  \ Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References\
  \ section.\n\nBrotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data\
  \ using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order\
  \ context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose\
  \ compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.\
  \ \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Scrapy: python-scrapy: brotli: Python brotli decompression bomb\
  \ DoS (CVE-2025-6176)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact,\
  \ a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed\
  \ in the References section."
