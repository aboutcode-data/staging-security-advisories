summary: |
  Updated packages for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0
  that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4, 5, and 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java
  applications, which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss
  Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

  It was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project
  allowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying
  Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
  denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
