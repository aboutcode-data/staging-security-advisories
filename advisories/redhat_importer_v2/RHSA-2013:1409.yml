  - CVE-2013-4342
summary: |
  An updated xinetd package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The xinetd package provides a secure replacement for inetd, the Internet
  services daemon. xinetd provides access control for all services based on
  the address of the remote host and/or on time of access, and can prevent
  denial-of-access attacks.

  It was found that xinetd ignored the user and group configuration
  directives for services running under the tcpmux-server service. This flaw
  could cause the associated services to run as root. If there was a flaw in
  such a service, a remote attacker could use it to execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the root user. (CVE-2013-4342)

  Red Hat would like to thank Thomas Swan of FedEx for reporting this issue.

  All xinetd users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
