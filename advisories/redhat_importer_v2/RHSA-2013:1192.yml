  - CVE-2013-4130
summary: |
  An updated spice-server package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a
  virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with
  network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
  viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
  (KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.

  A flaw was found in the way concurrent access to the clients ring buffer
  was performed in the spice-server library. A remote user able to initiate a
  SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server could use this
  flaw to crash the application. (CVE-2013-4130)

  This issue was discovered by David Gibson of Red Hat.

  Users of spice-server are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue. Applications acting as a
  SPICE server must be restarted for this update to take effect. Note that
  QEMU-KVM guests providing SPICE console access must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
