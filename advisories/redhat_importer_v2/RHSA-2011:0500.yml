summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and various
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A race condition in the way the Linux kernel's InfiniBand implementation
  set up new connections could allow a remote user to cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-0695, Important)

  * An integer signedness flaw in drm_modeset_ctl() could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2011-1013, Important)

  * A flaw in dccp_rcv_state_process() could allow a remote attacker to cause
  a denial of service, even when the socket was already closed.
  (CVE-2011-1093, Important)

  * A missing validation of a null-terminated string data structure element
  in bnep_sock_ioctl() could allow a local user to cause an information leak
  or a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1079, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll) implementation could
  allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-1082, Moderate)

  * A missing initialization flaw in the XFS file system implementation could
  lead to an information leak. (CVE-2011-0711, Low)

  * The start_code and end_code values in "/proc/[pid]/stat" were not
  protected. In certain scenarios, this flaw could be used to defeat Address
  Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). (CVE-2011-0726, Low)

  * A missing validation check in the Linux kernel's mac_partition()
  implementation, used for supporting file systems created on Mac OS
  operating systems, could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of
  service by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partitions.
  (CVE-2011-1010, Low)

  * A flaw in dev_load() could allow a local user who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN
  capability to load arbitrary modules from "/lib/modules/", instead of only
  netdev modules. (CVE-2011-1019, Low)

  * A missing initialization flaw in sco_sock_getsockopt_old() could allow a
  local, unprivileged user to cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1078, Low)

  * A buffer overflow flaw in the DEC Alpha OSF partition implementation in
  the Linux kernel could allow a local attacker to cause an information leak
  by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables.
  (CVE-2011-1163, Low)

  * Missing validations of null-terminated string data structure elements
  in the do_replace(), compat_do_replace(), do_ipt_get_ctl(),
  do_ip6t_get_ctl(), and do_arpt_get_ctl() functions could allow a local user
  who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to cause an information leak.
  (CVE-2011-1170, CVE-2011-1171, CVE-2011-1172, CVE-2011-1080, Low)

  CVE-2011-0711; Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2011-0726; and Timo Warns for
  reporting CVE-2011-1010 and CVE-2011-1163.

  This update also fixes various bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
  kernel to version 2.6.33.9-rt31, and correct these issues. The system must
  be rebooted for this update to take effect.
