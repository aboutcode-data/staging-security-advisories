  SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
  content. (CVE-2014-0534, CVE-2014-0535, CVE-2014-0536)

  Multiple flaws in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to conduct
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if a victim were tricked into visiting a
  specially crafted web page. (CVE-2014-0531, CVE-2014-0532, CVE-2014-0533)
