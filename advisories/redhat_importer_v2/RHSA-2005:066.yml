summary: "Updated kdegraphics packages that resolve security issues in kpdf are now\navailable.\n\
  \nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity\
  \ Response Team.\n\nThe kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop Environment\n\
  including kpdf, a pdf file viewer. \n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the Gfx::doImage\
  \ function of Xpdf that\nalso affects kpdf due to a shared codebase. An attacker could construct\
  \ a\ncarefully crafted PDF file that could cause kpdf to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary\
  \ code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\
  \ assigned the name CAN-2004-1125 to\nthis issue.\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the\
  \ Decrypt::makeFileKey2 function of\nXpdf which also affects kpdf due to a shared codebase.\
  \ An attacker could\nconstruct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause kpdf to crash\
  \ or\npossibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0064 to\nthis issue.\n\nDuring a\
  \ source code audit, Chris Evans and others discovered a number of\ninteger overflow bugs\
  \ that affected all versions of Xpdf which also affects\nkpdf due to a shared codebase. An\
  \ attacker could construct a carefully\ncrafted PDF file that could cause kpdf to crash or\
  \ possibly execute\narbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n\
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0888 to this issue.\n\nUsers should\
  \ update to these erratum packages which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues."
