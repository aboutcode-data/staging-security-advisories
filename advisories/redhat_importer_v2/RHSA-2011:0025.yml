summary: |
  Updated gcc packages that fix two security issues and several compiler bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The gcc packages include C, C++, Java, Fortran, Objective C, and Ada 95 GNU
  compilers, along with related support libraries. The libgcj package
  provides fastjar, an archive tool for Java Archive (JAR) files.

  Two directory traversal flaws were found in the way fastjar extracted JAR
  archive files. If a local, unsuspecting user extracted a specially-crafted
  JAR file, it could cause fastjar to overwrite arbitrary files writable by
  the user running fastjar. (CVE-2010-0831, CVE-2010-2322)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The option -print-multi-os-directory in the gcc --help output is not in
  the gcc(1) man page. This update applies an upstream patch to amend this.
  (BZ#529659)

  * An internal assertion in the compiler tried to check that a C++ static
  data member is external which resulted in errors. This was because when the
  compiler optimizes C++ anonymous namespaces the declarations were no longer
  marked external as everything on anonymous namespaces is local to the
  current translation. This update corrects the assertion to resolve this
  issue. (BZ#503565, BZ#508735, BZ#582682)

  * Attempting to compile certain .cpp files could have resulted in an
  internal compiler error. This update resolves this issue. (BZ#527510)

  * PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices with an appropriate DocFlavor
  failed to return a list of printers under gcj. This update includes a
  backported patch to correct this bug in the printer lookup service.
  (BZ#578382)

  * GCC would not build against xulrunner-devel-1.9.2. This update removes
  gcjwebplugin from the GCC RPM. (BZ#596097)

  * When a SystemTap generated kernel module was compiled, gcc reported an
  internal compiler error and gets a segmentation fault. This update applies
  a patch that, instead of crashing, assumes it can point to anything.
  (BZ#605803)

  * There was a performance issue with libstdc++ regarding all objects
  derived from or using std::streambuf because of lock contention between
  threads. This patch ensures reload uses the same value from _S_global for
  the comparison, _M_add_reference () and _M_impl member of the class.
  (BZ#635708)

  All gcc users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
