  - CVE-2012-2746
summary: |
  Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  A flaw was found in the way 389 Directory Server handled password changes.
  If an LDAP user has changed their password, and the directory server has
  not been restarted since that change, an attacker able to bind to the
  directory server could obtain the plain text version of that user's
  password via the "unhashed#user#password" attribute. (CVE-2012-2678)

  It was found that when the password for an LDAP user was changed, and audit
  logging was enabled (it is disabled by default), the new password was
  written to the audit log in plain text form. This update introduces a new
  configuration parameter, "nsslapd-auditlog-logging-hide-unhashed-pw", which
  when set to "on" (the default option), prevents 389 Directory Server from
  writing plain text passwords to the audit log. This option can be
  configured in "/etc/dirsrv/slapd-[ID]/dse.ldif". (CVE-2012-2746)

  All users of 389-ds-base are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which resolve these issues. After installing this update, the 389 server
  service will be restarted automatically.
