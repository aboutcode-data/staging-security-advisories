  - CVE-2015-7501
summary: |
  Updated rh-java-common-apache-commons-collections packages which fix one
  security issue are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The Apache Commons Collections library provides new interfaces,
  implementations, and utilities to extend the features of the Java
  Collections Framework.

  It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code
  execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed
  chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the
  commons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)

  With this update, deserialization of certain classes in the
  commons-collections library is no longer allowed. Applications that require
  those classes to be deserialized can use the system property
  "org.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization" to re-enable
  their deserialization.

  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023

  All users of rh-java-common-apache-commons-collections are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to
  correct this issue. All running applications using the commons-collections
  library must be restarted for the update to take effect.
