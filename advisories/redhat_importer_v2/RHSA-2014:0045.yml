summary: |
  An update for the seam-remoting component of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework
  Kit 2.4.0 that fixes two security issues is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  moderate security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications. The JBoss Seam Remoting
  component provides a convenient method of remotely accessing Seam
  components from a web page, using AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML).

  It was found that the ExecutionHandler, PollHandler, and
  SubscriptionHandler classes in JBoss Seam Remoting unmarshalled
  user-supplied XML and resolved external entities in this XML. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running
  the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XML
  External Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2013-6447)

  It was found that the InterfaceGenerator handler in JBoss Seam Remoting
  exposed details of all classes and methods on the server's classpath, not
  only methods with the org.jboss.seam.annotations.remoting.WebRemote
  annotation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to determine which
  classes are deployed on the JBoss server. (CVE-2013-6448)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jon Passki of Coverity SRL for reporting these
  issues.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.4.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
