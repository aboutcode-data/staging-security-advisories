summary: |
  Updated PostgreSQL packages to fix various security flaws are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
  (DBMS).

  A flaw in the LOAD command in PostgreSQL was discovered.  A local user
  could use this flaw to load arbitrary shared librarys and therefore execute
  arbitrary code, gaining the privileges of the PostgreSQL server.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2005-0227 to this issue.

  A permission checking flaw in PostgreSQL was discovered.  A local user
  could bypass the EXECUTE permission check for functions by using the CREATE
  AGGREGATE command.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0244 to this issue.

  Multiple buffer overflows were found in PL/PgSQL.  A database user who has
  permissions to create plpgsql functions could trigger this flaw which could
  lead to arbitrary code execution, gaining the privileges of the PostgreSQL
  server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the names CAN-2005-0245 and CAN-2005-0247 to these issues.

  A flaw in the integer aggregator (intagg) contrib module for PostgreSQL was
  found.  A user could create carefully crafted arrays and cause a denial of
  service (crash).  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0246 to this issue.

  Users of PostgreSQL are advised to update to these erratum packages which
  are not vulnerable to these issues.
