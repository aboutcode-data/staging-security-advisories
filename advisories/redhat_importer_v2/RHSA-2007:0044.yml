  - CVE-2007-0494
summary: "Updated bind packages that fix a security issue and a bug are now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS\n(Domain\
  \ Name System) protocols.  \n\nA flaw was found in the way BIND processed certain DNS query\
  \ responses.  On\nservers that had enabled DNSSEC validation, this could allow an remote\n\
  attacker to cause a denial of service.  (CVE-2007-0494)\n\nFor users of Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 3, the previous BIND update caused an\nincompatible change to the default configuration\
  \ that resulted in rndc not\nsharing the key with the named daemon. This update corrects this\
  \ bug and\nrestores the behavior prior to that update.\n\nUpdating the bind package in Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 3 could result in\nnonfunctional configuration in case the bind-libs\
  \ package was not updated.\nThis update corrects this bug by adding the correct dependency\
  \ on bind-libs.\n\nUsers of BIND are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\n\
  contain backported patches to correct these issues."
