summary: |
  Updated nodejs010-nodejs packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Node.js is a software development platform for building fast and scalable
  network applications in the JavaScript programming language.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Node.js handled pipelined
  HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send an excessive
  amount of HTTP requests over a network connection, causing Node.js to use
  an excessive amount of memory and possibly exit when all available memory
  is exhausted. (CVE-2013-4450)

  Node.js is included in Red Hat Software Collections 1.0 as a Technology
  Preview. More information about Red Hat Technology Previews is available
  here: https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/

  All nodejs010-nodejs users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
