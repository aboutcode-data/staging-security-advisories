summary: "A security vulnerability  in the Linux CIPE (VPN tunnel) implementation has\nbeen\
  \ fixed.\n\nLarry McVoy has discovered a problem in the CIPE (VPN tunnel)\nimplementation\
  \ where a malformed packet could cause a crash. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-0047 to this issue.\n\nAndrew Griffiths\
  \ has discovered a vulnerability that allows remote machines\nto read random memory using\
  \ a bug in the Linux ICMP implementation.\nHowever, 2.4 kernels after version 2.4.0-test6\
  \ and 2.2 kernels after\nversion 2.2.18 fix this issue. All Red Hat Linux 2.4 kernels have\
  \ this\nfix and are not vulnerable to this bug.\n\nIt is recommended that users running older\
  \ 2.2 kernels on Red Hat Linux 6.2\nor 7 upgrade to the latest available errata kernel, which\
  \ includes a fix\nfor this problem.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2002-0046 to this issue.\n\nA patch for recent 2.4 kernels is\
  \ circulating to fix the bug in the Linux\nICMP implementation. Red Hat, Inc. recommends that\
  \ you do not use this\npatch since Red Hat Linux 2.4 kernels are not vulnerable to the bug\
  \ and the\npatch will actually break the kernel ICMP implementation.\n\nIn addition to the\
  \ CIPE security fix, several other bugs were fixed, and\nsome drivers were updated:\n\n* For\
  \ Red Hat Linux 7.1: DRM/DRI (3D support) for the XFree86 erratum\n  RHEA-2002:010\n* New\
  \ aacraid driver rewritten by Alan Cox\n* New DAC960 driver\n* Additional Qlogic 2200 driver\
  \ \n* LM_Sensors driver upgrade\n\nPlease note the additional procedures in the \"Solutions\"\
  \ section as they\ndiffer from standard update procedures."
