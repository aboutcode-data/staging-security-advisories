summary: |
  Updated gnutls packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). The gnutls packages also
  include the libtasn1 library, which provides Abstract Syntax Notation One
  (ASN.1) parsing and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules
  (DER) encoding and decoding functions.

  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
  messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
  to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
  overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
  the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2014-3466)

  It was discovered that the asn1_get_bit_der() function of the libtasn1
  library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
  crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
  an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

  Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
  libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
  libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
  asn1_read_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
  application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
  aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon as the original
  reporter of CVE-2014-3466.

  Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
  linked to the GnuTLS or libtasn1 library must be restarted.
