  - CVE-2010-3864
summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  A race condition flaw has been found in the OpenSSL TLS server extension
  parsing code, which could affect some multithreaded OpenSSL applications.
  Under certain specific conditions, it may be possible for a remote attacker
  to trigger this race condition and cause such an application to crash, or
  possibly execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application.
  (CVE-2010-3864)

  Note that this issue does not affect the Apache HTTP Server. Refer to Red
  Hat Bugzilla bug 649304 for more technical details on how to determine if
  your application is affected.

  Red Hat would like to thank Rob Hulswit for reporting this issue.

  All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. For the update to take effect, all
  services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system
  rebooted.
