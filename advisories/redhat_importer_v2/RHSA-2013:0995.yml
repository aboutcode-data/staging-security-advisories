summary: |
  Updated Foreman packages that fix two security issues and multiple bugs
  are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Foreman packages provide facilities for rapidly deploying Red Hat
  OpenStack 3.0 ("Grizzly") Preview. These packages are provided as a
  Technology Preview. For more information on the scope and nature of support
  for items marked as Technology Preview, refer to
  https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/

  A flaw was found in the create method of the Foreman Bookmarks controller.
  A user with privileges to create a bookmark could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Foreman, giving them
  control of the system running Foreman (such as installing new packages) and
  all systems managed by Foreman. (CVE-2013-2121)

  A flaw was found in the way the Foreman UsersController controller handled
  user creation. A non-admin user with privileges to create non-admin
  accounts could use this flaw to create admin accounts, giving them control
  of the system running Foreman (such as installing new packages) and all
  systems managed by Foreman. (CVE-2013-2113)

  These issues were discovered by Ramon de C Valle of the Red Hat Product
  Security Team.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The cron job for Puppet had an incorrect path when installed via the
  Foreman installer. (BZ#969531)

  * This update removes provisioning templates and installation media for
  unsupported client operating systems. (BZ#971545)

  * Previously, the init script for Foreman was installed in the /opt/
  directory, resulting in errors when attempting to use the "service"
  command to control Foreman, and errors when installing or upgrading the
  Foreman packages. As the Foreman service is not needed for Red Hat
  OpenStack, this update removes the init script. (BZ#972755)

  * Previously, after using Foreman to install controller and compute nodes,
  it was not possible to launch compute instances. (BZ#972780)

  * Previously, Foreman compiled assets for an incorrect path. The assets
  were configured for "[fully qualified domain name]/foreman", which is not
  where Foreman is served from in Red Hat OpenStack. (BZ#975068)

  * Previously, the Foreman installer used a reference to an OpenStack
  host's network interface instead of its own secondary interface when
  creating a subnet, which could cause subnet creation to fail and a "rake
  aborted!" message to be displayed. (BZ#976907)

  Users of Foreman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. In Red Hat OpenStack, Foreman runs on the Apache HTTP
  Server using mod_passenger. As such, after installing the updated packages,
  the httpd service must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for this
  update to take effect.
