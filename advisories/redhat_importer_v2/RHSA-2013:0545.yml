summary: |
  CloudForms Cloud Engine 1.1.2 is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat CloudForms is an on-premise hybrid cloud
  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product that lets you create and manage
  private and public clouds. It provides self-service computing resources to
  users in a managed, governed, and secure way. CloudForms Cloud Engine is a
  management application for cloud resources.

  It was found that the Aeolus Configuration Server stored passwords in plain
  text in the world-readable "/var/log/aeolus-configserver/configserver.log"
  file. A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain the administrative
  passwords for other services (such as Katello, databases, and so on).
  (CVE-2012-6117)

  It was found that Conductor, the web-based management console, allowed
  unprivileged users to modify their quota for the number of instances they
  are allowed to run. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to monopolize
  resources and run more instances than intended. (CVE-2012-6118)

  It was found that the aeolus-configserver-setup script created a
  world-readable file containing authentication details in plain text in the
  "/tmp/" directory. A local attacker could use this flaw to obtain Audrey
  credentials, allowing them to make configuration changes to Audrey-enabled
  instances. (CVE-2012-5509)

  The CVE-2012-6117 issue was discovered by James Laska of Red Hat;
  CVE-2012-6118 was discovered by Tomas Sedovic of Red Hat; and CVE-2012-5509
  was discovered by Aaron Weitekamp of the Red Hat Cloud Quality Engineering
  team.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * A bug in the initial filter view for instances caused stopped instances
  to display for the default "Non stopped applications" option until
  auto-refresh. This bug fix corrects the form rendering for the filter view.
  The filter view now displays only non-stopped instances. (BZ#895569)

  Additionally, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 support to guest image building in
  CloudForms Cloud Engine. (BZ#903646)

  * Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Amazon Machine Images (AMI) on
  Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) providers for
  CloudForms Cloud Engine. (BZ#903651)

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 support to guest image building in
  CloudForms Cloud Engine. (BZ#903395)

  * Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Amazon Machine Images (AMI) on
  Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) providers for
  CloudForms Cloud Engine. (BZ#903650)
