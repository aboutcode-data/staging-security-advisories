summary: |
  An update for httpd24-httpd is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the httpd's mod_auth_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)

  * It was discovered that the use of httpd's ap_get_basic_auth_pw() API function outside of the authentication phase could lead to authentication bypass. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass required authentication if the API was used incorrectly by one of the modules used by httpd. (CVE-2017-3167)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd's mod_ssl module. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an httpd child process to crash if another module used by httpd called a certain API function during the processing of an HTTPS request. (CVE-2017-3169)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the mod_http2 module of httpd. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash via a specially crafted HTTP/2 request. (CVE-2017-7659)

  * A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd's ap_find_token() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash via a specially crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2017-7668)

  * A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd's mod_mime module. A user permitted to modify httpd's MIME configuration could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2017-7679)
