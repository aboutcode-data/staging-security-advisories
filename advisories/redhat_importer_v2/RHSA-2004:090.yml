  - CVE-2004-0110
summary: "Updated libxml2 packages that fix an overflow when parsing remote resources\nare now\
  \ available.\n\nlibxml2 is a library for manipulating XML files.\n\nYuuichi Teranishi discovered\
  \ a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6. \nWhen fetching a remote resource via FTP or\
  \ HTTP, libxml2 uses special\nparsing routines.  These routines can overflow a buffer if passed\
  \ a very\nlong URL.  If an attacker is able to find an application using libxml2 that\nparses\
  \ remote resources and allows them to influence the URL, then this\nflaw could be used to\
  \ execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2004-0110\nto this issue.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported fix and are not vulnerable to this\
  \ issue."
