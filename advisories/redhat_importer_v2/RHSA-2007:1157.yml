summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Application Stack v1 and v2.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. MySQL is a
  client/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld), and
  many different client programs and libraries.

  A flaw was found in a way MySQL handled symbolic links when database tables
  were created with explicit "DATA" and "INDEX DIRECTORY" options. An
  authenticated user could create a table that would overwrite tables in
  other databases, causing destruction of data or allowing the user to
  elevate privileges. (CVE-2007-5969)

  A flaw was found in a way MySQL's InnoDB engine handled spatial indexes. An
  authenticated user could create a table with spatial indexes, which are not
  supported by the InnoDB engine, that would cause the mysql daemon to crash
  when used. This issue only causes a temporary denial of service, as the
  mysql daemon will be automatically restarted after the crash.
  (CVE-2007-5925)

  A flaw was found in a way MySQL handled the "DEFINER" view parameter. A
  user with the "ALTER VIEW" privilege for a view created by another database
  user, could modify that view to get access to any data accessible to the
  creator of said view. (CVE-2007-6303)

  All mysql users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
