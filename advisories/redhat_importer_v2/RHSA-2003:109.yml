  - CVE-2003-0140
summary: |
  New Balsa, Mutt, and libesmtp packages that fix potential buffer overflow
  vulnerabilities are now available.

  Mutt is a text-mode email client. Balsa is a GNOME email client which
  includes code from Mutt.

  A potential buffer overflow in Mutt version 1.4 exists when parsing mailbox
  names returned by an IMAP server. It is possible that a hostile IMAP server
  could cause arbitrary code to be executed by the user running Mutt.  This
  issue affects versions of Mutt provided with Red Hat Linux 8.0 and Red Hat
  Linux 9.

  Versions 1.2 and higher of Balsa incorporate the vulnerable Mutt IMAP code
  and are therefore vulnerable to this issue as well.  It is possible that a
  hostile IMAP server could cause arbitrary code to be executed by the user
  running Balsa.  This issue affects Red Hat Linux 7.2, 7.3, 8.0 and 9.

  Additionally, a buffer overflow in libesmtp, an SMTP library used by Balsa,
  before version 0.8.11 allows a hostile remote SMTP server to execute
  arbitrary code via a certain response or cause a denial of service via long
  server responses.  This issue only affects versions of libesmtp provided by
  Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3.

  Users of Mutt and Balsa are recommended to update to these erratum packages
  containing updated versions of Mutt, Balsa, and libesmtp which are not
  vulnerable to these issues.
