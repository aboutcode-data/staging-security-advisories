  - CVE-2004-1072
summary: |
  An updated ia32el package that fixes several bugs is now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The ia32el package contains IA-32 Execution Layer platform which allows
  emulation of IA-32 binaries on IA-64.

  A flaw was found in the binfmt_elf loader of the Linux kernel which also
  affects the IA-32 Execution Layer.  A local user could create an
  interpreter name string that is not NULL terminated, leading to a denial of
  service (crash).  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1072 to this issue.

  This update also addresses the following issues:

  -- Fixed execve to invoke ia32 interpreter
  -- Credential fixes
  -- Fixed a bug causing ibm-jvm to fail
  -- Other minor bug fixes

  Please refer to the package release notes for detailed information about
  these changes.

  All users of ia32el should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues.
