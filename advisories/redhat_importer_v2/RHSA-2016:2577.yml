summary: |
  An update for libvirt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The libvirt library contains a C API for managing and interacting with the virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized systems.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: libvirt (2.0.0). (BZ#830971, BZ#1286679)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the libvirt daemon, when using RBD (RADOS Block Device), leaked private credentials to the process list. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform certain privileged operations within the cluster. (CVE-2015-5160)

  * A path-traversal flaw was found in the way the libvirt daemon handled filesystem names for storage volumes. A libvirt user with privileges to create storage volumes and without privileges to create and modify domains could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2015-5313)

  * It was found that setting a VNC password to an empty string in libvirt did not disable all access to the VNC server as documented, instead it allowed access with no authentication required. An attacker could use this flaw to access a VNC server with an empty VNC password without any authentication. (CVE-2016-5008)

  Additional Changes:

  For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.
