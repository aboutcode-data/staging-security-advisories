  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit
  2.5.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 2.6.0 Release
  Notes for information on the most significant of these changes, available
  shortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/

  This release also fixes the following security issues:

  It was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when
  decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding
  oracle. (CVE-2013-1624)

  It was found that Mojarra JavaServer Faces did not properly escape
  user-supplied content in certain circumstances. Contents of outputText tags
  and raw EL expressions that immediately follow script or style elements
  were not escaped. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL to
  execute arbitrary web script in the user's browser. (CVE-2013-5855)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Framework
  Kit 2.6.0.
