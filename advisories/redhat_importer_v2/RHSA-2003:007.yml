summary: "Updated libpng packages are available which fix a buffer overflow\nvulnerability.\n\
  \n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for Advanced Workstation 2.1\n\nThe libpng package\
  \ contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics)\
  \ image format files. PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format. \n\n\
  Unpatched versions of libpng 1.2.1 and earlier do not correctly calculate\noffsets, which\
  \ leads to a buffer overflow and the possibility of arbitrary\ncode execution.  This could\
  \ be exploited by an attacker creating a\ncarefully crafted PNG file which could execute arbitrary\
  \ code when the\nvictim views it.\n\nPackages within Red Hat Linux Advanced Server, such as\
  \ Mozilla, make use of\nthe shared libpng library.  All users are advised to upgrade to the\
  \ errata\npackages, which contain libpng 1.0.14 with a backported patch that corrects\nthis\
  \ issue."
