summary: |
  Updated rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord
  packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat
  CloudForms.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
  components. Active Record implements object-relational mapping for
  accessing database entries using objects. Active Support provides support
  and utility classes used by the Ruby on Rails framework.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way Ruby on Rails performed XML parameter
  parsing in HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails application,
  perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication using a
  specially-created HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0156)

  Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for the CVE-2013-0156 issues is
  available that allows remote code execution in applications using Ruby on
  Rails.

  A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails performed JSON parameter parsing.
  If a Ruby on Rails application passed JSON parameters to Active Record, it
  could result in the generation of unexpected SQL queries. A remote attacker
  could possibly use this flaw to manipulate SQL queries executed by the
  application. (CVE-2013-0155)

  A flaw was found in the way rubygem-activerecord dynamic finders extracted
  options from method parameters. A remote attacker could possibly use this
  flaw to perform SQL injection attacks against applications using the Active
  Record dynamic finder methods. (CVE-2012-6496)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated rubygem-actionpack,
  rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord packages, which resolve
  these issues. Users of CloudForms Cloud Engine must run "aeolus-services
  restart" and users of CloudForms System Engine must run "katello-service
  restart" for this update to take effect.
