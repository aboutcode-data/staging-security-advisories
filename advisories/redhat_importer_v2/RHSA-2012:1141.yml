  - CVE-2012-3571
  - CVE-2012-3954
summary: |
  Updated dhcp packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
  individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
  information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
  address.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the dhcpd daemon handled
  zero-length client identifiers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  send a specially-crafted request to dhcpd, possibly causing it to enter an
  infinite loop and consume an excessive amount of CPU time. (CVE-2012-3571)

  Two memory leak flaws were found in the dhcpd daemon. A remote attacker
  could use these flaws to cause dhcpd to exhaust all available memory by
  sending a large number of DHCP requests. (CVE-2012-3954)

  Upstream acknowledges Markus Hietava of the Codenomicon CROSS project as
  the original reporter of CVE-2012-3571, and Glen Eustace of Massey
  University, New Zealand, as the original reporter of CVE-2012-3954.

  Users of DHCP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this update,
  all DHCP servers will be restarted automatically.
