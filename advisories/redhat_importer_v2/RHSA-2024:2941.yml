summary: |
  Updated images are now available for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security. The updated image includes changes, bug fixes, and updates to patch vulnerabilities.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  This release of RHACS 4.4.2 provides the following bug fixes:

  * Before this update, Collector pods on nodes with 128 or more cores would fail with a `CrashLoopBackOff` status due to issues with how the CO-RE BPF allocated kernel memory. The patch release fixes this issue.
  * This release updates the Scanner baseline vulnerability data to address changes made to the Red Hat security data feeds that were not compatible with earlier data from Scanner’s scheduled feed processing. This fixes various issues where vulnerabilities were detected for images containing packages that were incorrectly indicated as affected by a vulnerability.
  * This release fixes a crash and rendering error in the network graph that occurs when Central is running an RHACS release of 4.3.6 or earlier and Sensor is running an RHACS release of 4.4.0 or later.
  * Previously, RHACS did not update the alerts when violations changed. This release fixes the issue, and RHACS correctly updates the alerts when violations change.

  This release provides the following changes:

  * The default telemetry endpoint is now set to a Red Hat proxy.
  * This release includes a new environment variable, ROX_API_TOKEN_FILE, that you can use to pass your API’s token file path to the `roxctl` CLI.

  This releases updates the following items to patch vulnerabilities:

  * (CVE-2023-45288) Go has been updated to release 1.21.9.
  * (CVE-2023-45288) The `golang.org/x/net` module has been updated from release v0.22.0 to v0.23.0.
  * (CVE-2024-29180) webpack-dev-middleware module has been updated form version 5.3.3 to 5.3.4.
