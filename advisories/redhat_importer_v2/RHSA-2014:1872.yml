  - CVE-2014-5077
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled
  simultaneous connections between the same hosts. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-5077, Important)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * This update fixes several race conditions between PCI error recovery
  callbacks and potential calls of the ifup and ifdown commands in the tg3
  driver. When triggered, these race conditions could cause a kernel crash.
  (BZ#1142568)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
