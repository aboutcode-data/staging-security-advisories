  - CVE-2012-3525
summary: |
  An updated jabberd package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Network Proxy 5.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  This package provides jabberd 2, an Extensible Messaging and Presence
  Protocol (XMPP) server used for XML based communication.

  It was discovered that the XMPP Dialback protocol implementation in
  jabberd 2 did not properly validate Verify Response and Authorization
  Response messages. A remote attacker able to connect to the jabberd's
  server-to-server communication port could possibly use this flaw to spoof
  source domains of the XMPP messages. (CVE-2012-3525)

  Users of Red Hat Network Proxy 5.5 are advised to upgrade to this updated
  jabberd package, which resolves this issue. For this update to take effect,
  Red Hat Network Proxy must be restarted. Refer to the Solution section for
  details.
