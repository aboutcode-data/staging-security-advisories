  - CVE-2012-1145
summary: |
  Updated spacewalk-backend packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite is a systems management tool for
  Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and
  remote management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized
  tool.

  It was found that a remote attacker could upload packages to an RHN
  Satellite server's NULL organization without any authorization or
  authentication. (The NULL organization stores packages synced from RHN
  Hosted.) Although an attacker cannot put packages into an arbitrary channel
  and have client systems download them, they could use the flaw to consume
  all the free space in the partition (/var/) used to store synced packages.
  With no free space, Satellite would be unable to download updates and new
  packages, preventing client systems from obtaining them. (CVE-2012-1145)

  All users of Red Hat Network Satellite are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct this issue. For this update to take effect,
  Red Hat Network Satellite must be restarted. Refer to the Solution section
  for details.
