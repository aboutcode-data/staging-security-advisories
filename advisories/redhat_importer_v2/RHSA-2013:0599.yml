  - CVE-2012-6075
summary: |
  Updated xen packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
  managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU emulated the e1000 network interface card
  when the host was configured to accept jumbo network frames, and a
  fully-virtualized guest using the e1000 emulated driver was not. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with root privileges in the guest. (CVE-2012-6075)

  All users of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. After installing the updated packages, all running
  fully-virtualized guests must be restarted for this update to take effect.
