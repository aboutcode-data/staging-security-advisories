summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1587, CVE-2014-1590, CVE-2014-1592, CVE-2014-1593)

  A flaw was found in the Alarm API, which could allow applications to
  schedule actions to be run in the future. A malicious web application could
  use this flaw to bypass the same-origin policy. (CVE-2014-1594)

  Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
  HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
  They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
  viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

  This update disables SSL 3.0 support by default in Thunderbird. Details on
  how to re-enable SSL 3.0 support are available at:
  https://access.redhat.com/articles/1284233

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Gary Kwong, Randell Jesup, Nils Ohlmeier, Jesse
  Ruderman, Max Jonas Werner, Joe Vennix, Berend-Jan Wever, Abhishek Arya,
  and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Thunderbird 31.3.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 31.3.0, which corrects these issues.
  After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
  to take effect.
