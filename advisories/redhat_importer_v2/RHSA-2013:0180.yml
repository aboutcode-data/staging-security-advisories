summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
  the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the user permission
  checking code in MySQL. An authenticated database user could use this flaw
  to crash the mysqld daemon or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the mysqld daemon. (CVE-2012-5611)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL calculated the key length when creating
  a sort order index for certain queries. An authenticated database user
  could use this flaw to crash the mysqld daemon. (CVE-2012-2749)

  This update also adds a patch for a potential flaw in the MySQL password
  checking function, which could allow an attacker to log into any MySQL
  account without knowing the correct password. This problem (CVE-2012-2122)
  only affected MySQL packages that use a certain compiler and C library
  optimization. It did not affect the mysql packages in Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5. The patch is being added as a preventive measure to ensure this
  problem cannot get exposed in future revisions of the mysql packages.
  (BZ#814605)

  All MySQL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon
  (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.
