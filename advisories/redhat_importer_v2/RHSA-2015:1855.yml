aliases:
  - CVE-2014-3583
summary: |
  An updated mod_proxy_fcgi package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
  storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage
  system with a Ceph management platform, deployment tools, and support
  services.

  The mod_proxy_fcgi package provides a proxy module for the Apache 2.2 HTTP
  server.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in mod_proxy_fcgi's handle_headers()
  function. A malicious FastCGI server that httpd is configured to connect to
  could send a carefully crafted response that would cause an httpd child
  process handling the request to crash. (CVE-2014-3583)

  All mod_proxy_fcgi users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which corrects this issue.
