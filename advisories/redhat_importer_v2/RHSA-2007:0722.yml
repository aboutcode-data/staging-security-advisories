summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey processed certain malformed
  JavaScript code. A web page containing malicious JavaScript code could
  cause SeaMonkey to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user
  running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-3734, CVE-2007-3735, CVE-2007-3737, CVE-2007-3738)

  Several content injection flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey handled
  certain JavaScript code. A web page containing malicious JavaScript code
  could inject arbitrary content into other web pages. (CVE-2007-3736,
  CVE-2007-3089)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey cached web pages on the local disk. A
  malicious web page may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing
  session if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-3656)

  Users of SeaMonkey are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
  contain backported patches that correct these issues.
