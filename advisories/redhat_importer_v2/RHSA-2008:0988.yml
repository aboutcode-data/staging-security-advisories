  - CVE-2008-4226
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  libxml2 is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. It includes
  support for reading, modifying, and writing XML and HTML files.

  An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was found in
  the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against libxml2 processed
  untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-4226)

  A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser. If an
  application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML
  content, it could cause the application to enter an infinite loop.
  (CVE-2008-4225)

  Red Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of the Apple Product Security team for
  reporting these issues.

  Users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
