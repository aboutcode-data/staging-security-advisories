  - CVE-2003-0848
summary: |
  Updated slocate packages are now available that fix a heap overflow
  vulnerability.

  Slocate is a security-enhanced version of locate, designed to find files on
  a system via a central database.

  Patrik Hornik discovered a vulnerability in Slocate versions up to and
  including 2.7 where a carefully crafted database could overflow a
  heap-based buffer.  A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain
  "slocate" group privileges and then read the entire slocate database.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2003-0848 to this issue.

  Users of Slocate should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a
  patch from Kevin Lindsay that causes slocate to drop privileges before
  reading a user-supplied database.
