summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix security issues, two bugs, and add two
  enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  These updated packages fix the following security issues:

  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation in
  the Linux kernel. Several of the NFSv4 file locking functions failed to
  check whether a file had been opened on the server before performing
  locking operations on it. A local user on a system with an NFSv4 share
  mounted could possibly use this flaw to cause a denial of service or
  escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-3726, Important)

  * permission issues were found in the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS based
  RAID controllers) in the Linux kernel. The "dbg_lvl" and "poll_mode_io"
  files on the sysfs file system ("/sys/") had world-writable permissions.
  This could allow local, unprivileged users to change the behavior of the
  driver. (CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, Moderate)

  These updated packages also fix the following bugs:

  * a problem existed with the i5000_edac driver under some topologies. In
  some cases, this driver failed to export memory devices via sysfs,
  preventing the ibm-prtm service from starting. With this update, the memory
  devices are accessible, allowing the ibm-prtm service to start, and
  therefore perform SMI remediation as expected. (BZ#527421)

  * the "/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr" tunable helps prevent unprivileged
  users from creating new memory mappings below the minimum address. The
  sysctl value for mmap_min_addr could be changed by a process or user that
  has an effective user ID (euid) of 0, even if the process or user does not
  have the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability. This update adds a capability check for
  the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability before allowing the mmap_min_addr value to be
  changed. (BZ#534019)

  As well, these updated packages add the following enhancements:

  * the Intel ixgbe driver was updated to upstream version 2.0.16-k2.
  (BZ#537505)

  * the InfiniBand OFED driver was updated to upstream version 1.4.1.
  (BZ#537500)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must
  be rebooted for this update to take effect.
