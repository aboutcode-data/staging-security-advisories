  - CVE-2017-7895
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * The NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations in the Linux kernel through 4.10.13 lacked certain checks for the end of a buffer. A remote attacker could trigger a pointer-arithmetic error or possibly cause other unspecified impacts using crafted requests related to fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c and fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c. (CVE-2017-7895, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ari Kauppi for reporting this issue.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * If a VFC port became unmapped in the VIOS, it sometimes did not respond with a CRQ init complete following the H_REG_CRQ() call. As a consequence, scsi_block_requests were called until the init complete occurred. If not, I/O requests were hung. The provided patch ensures the host action stays set to IBMVFC_HOST_ACTION_TGT_DEL so that all rports are moved into devloss state unless an init complete is received. (BZ#1460210)
