summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix various security issues in the Red Hat\nEnterprise\
  \ Linux 4 kernel are now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Linux kernel is the core of the operating\
  \ system.\n\nThese updated kernel packages contain fixes for the following security\nissues:\n\
  \n* A flaw was found in the handling of process death signals. This allowed a\nlocal user\
  \ to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process executed by that\nuser. A successful exploitation\
  \ of this flaw depends on the structure of\nthe suid-program and its signal handling. (CVE-2007-3848,\
  \ Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the CIFS file system. This could cause the umask\nvalues\
  \ of a process to not be honored on CIFS file systems where UNIX\nextensions are supported.\
  \ (CVE-2007-3740, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the VFAT compat ioctl handling on 64-bit\
  \ systems. \nThis allowed a local user to corrupt a kernel_dirent struct and cause a\ndenial\
  \ of service. (CVE-2007-2878, Important) \n\n* A flaw was found in the Advanced Linux Sound\
  \ Architecture (ALSA). A local\nuser who had the ability to read the /proc/driver/snd-page-alloc\
  \ file could\nsee portions of kernel memory. (CVE-2007-4571, Moderate) \n\n* A flaw was found\
  \ in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local user to\nmake ioctl calls to the driver\
  \ that should be restricted to privileged\nusers. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate) \n\n* A flaw was\
  \ found in the stack expansion when using the hugetlb kernel on\nPowerPC systems. This allowed\
  \ a local user to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2007-3739, Moderate) \n\n* A flaw was found\
  \ in the handling of zombie processes. A local user could\ncreate processes that would not\
  \ be properly reaped which could lead to a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2006-6921, Moderate)\n\
  \n* A flaw was found in the CIFS file system handling. The mount option\n\"sec=\" did not\
  \ enable integrity checking or produce an error message if\nused. (CVE-2007-3843, Low)\n\n\
  * A flaw was found in the random number generator implementation that\nallowed a local user\
  \ to cause a denial of service or possibly gain\nprivileges. This flaw could be exploited\
  \ if the root user raised the\ndefault wakeup threshold over the size of the output pool.\n\
  (CVE-2007-3105, Low)\n\nAdditionally, the following bugs were fixed:\n\n* A flaw was found\
  \ in the kernel netpoll code, creating a potential\ndeadlock condition.  If the xmit_lock\
  \ for a given network interface is\nheld, and a subsequent netpoll event is generated from\
  \ within the lock\nowning context (a console message for example), deadlock on that cpu will\n\
  result, because the netpoll code will attempt to re-acquire the xmit_lock.\n The fix is to,\
  \ in the netpoll code, only attempt to take the lock, and\nfail if it is already acquired\
  \ (rather than block on it), and queue the\nmessage to be sent for later delivery.  Any user\
  \ of netpoll code in the\nkernel (netdump or netconsole services), is exposed to this problem,\
  \ and\nshould resolve the issue by upgrading to this kernel release immediately.\n\n* A flaw\
  \ was found where, under 64-bit mode (x86_64), AMD processors were\nnot able to address greater\
  \ than a 40-bit physical address space; and Intel\nprocessors were only able to address up\
  \ to a 36-bit physical address space. \nThe fix is to increase the physical addressing for\
  \ an AMD processor to 48\nbits, and an Intel processor to 38 bits.  Please see the Red Hat\n\
  Knowledgebase for more detailed information.\n\n* A flaw was found in the xenU kernel that\
  \ may prevent a paravirtualized\nguest with more than one CPU from starting when running under\
  \ an Enterprise\nLinux 5.1 hypervisor.  The fix is to allow your Enterprise Linux 4 Xen SMP\n\
  guests to boot under a 5.1 hypervisor. Please see the Red Hat Knowledgebase\nfor more detailed\
  \ information.\n \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\n\
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues."
