  - CVE-2007-3852
summary: |
  An updated sysstat package that fixes one security issue, various bugs, and
  adds one enhancement is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The sysstat package contains a set of utilities which enable system
  monitoring of disks, network, and other I/O activity.

  It was found that the sysstat initscript created a temporary file in an
  insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to create arbitrary
  files via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2007-3852)

  This update fixes the following bugs:

  * On systems under heavy load, the sadc utility would sometimes output the
  following error message if a write() call was unable to write all of the
  requested input:

  "Cannot write data to system activity file: Success."

  In this updated package, the sadc utility tries to write the remaining
  input, resolving this issue. (BZ#454617)

  * On the Itanium architecture, the "sar -I" command provided incorrect
  information about the interrupt statistics of the system. With this update,
  the "sar -I" command has been disabled for this architecture, preventing
  this bug. (BZ#468340)

  * Previously, the "iostat -n" command used invalid data to create
  statistics for read and write operations. With this update, the data source
  for these statistics has been fixed, and the iostat utility now returns
  correct information. (BZ#484439)

  * The "sar -d" command used to output invalid data about block devices.
  With this update, the sar utility recognizes disk registration and disk
  overflow statistics properly, and only correct and relevant data is now
  displayed. (BZ#517490)

  * Previously, the sar utility set the maximum number of days to be logged
  in one month too high. Consequently, data from a month was appended to
  data from the preceding month. With this update, the maximum number of days
  has been set to 25, and data from a month now correctly replaces data from
  the preceding month. (BZ#578929)

  * In previous versions of the iostat utility, the number of NFS mount
  points was hard-coded. Consequently, various issues occurred while iostat
  was running and NFS mount points were mounted or unmounted; certain values
  in iostat reports overflowed and some mount points were not reported at
  all. With this update, iostat properly recognizes when an NFS mount point
  mounts or unmounts, fixing these issues. (BZ#675058, BZ#706095, BZ#694767)

  * When a device name was longer than 13 characters, the iostat utility
  printed a redundant new line character, making its output less readable.
  This bug has been fixed and now, no extra characters are printed if a long
  device name occurs in iostat output. (BZ#604637)

  * Previously, if kernel interrupt counters overflowed, the sar utility
  provided confusing output. This bug has been fixed and the sum of
  interrupts is now reported correctly. (BZ#622557)

  * When some processors were disabled on a multi-processor system, the sar
  utility sometimes failed to provide information about the CPU activity.
  With this update, the uptime of a single processor is used to compute the
  statistics, rather than the total uptime of all processors, and this bug no
  longer occurs. (BZ#630559)

  * Previously, the mpstat utility wrongly interpreted data about processors
  in the system. Consequently, it reported a processor that did not exist.
  This bug has been fixed and non-existent CPUs are no longer reported by
  mpstat. (BZ#579409)

  * Previously, there was no easy way to enable the collection of statistics
  about disks and interrupts. Now, the SADC_OPTIONS variable can be used to
  set parameters for the sadc utility, fixing this bug. (BZ#598794)

  * The read_uptime() function failed to close its open file upon exit. A
  patch has been provided to fix this bug. (BZ#696672)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * With this update, the cifsiostat utility has been added to the sysstat
  package to provide CIFS (Common Internet File System) mount point I/O
  statistics. (BZ#591530)

  All sysstat users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement.
