summary: |
  Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix three security issues,
  multiple bugs, and add an enhancement are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a
  graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
  resources.

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way orchestration
  templates were handled. An owner of such a template could use this flaw to
  perform XSS attacks against other Horizon users. (CVE-2014-3473)

  It was found that network names were not sanitized. A malicious user could
  use this flaw to perform XSS attacks against other Horizon users by
  creating a network with a specially crafted name. (CVE-2014-3474)

  It was found that certain email addresses were not sanitized. An
  administrator could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks against other
  Horizon users by storing an email address that has a specially crafted
  name. (CVE-2014-3475)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Jason Hullinger from Hewlett Packard as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-3473, Craig Lorentzen from Cisco as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-3474, and Michael Xin from Rackspace as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-3475.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The python-django-horizon package has been updated to upstream version
  2014.1.1. This includes several important bug fixes, including an issue
  that prevented access to Swift pseudo-folders through the Dashboard, and
  an issue that prevented instances from being launched when using the French
  locale (or other locales that use apostrophes). (BZ#1117901)

  Lastly, this update also adds the following enhancement:

  * A new "Update" option has been added for OpenStack Networking VPNaaS
  support for Dashboard. This makes it easier to use Virtual Private Network
  as a Service (VPNaaS). (BZ#1042030)

  All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement.
