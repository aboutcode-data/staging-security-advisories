aliases:
  - CVE-2020-0256
  - CVE-2021-0308
summary: |
  An update for gdisk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The gdisk packages provide the gdisk partitioning utility for GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks. The utility features a command-line interface similar to fdisk, direct manipulation of partition table structures, recovery tools to deal with corrupt partition tables, and the ability to convert Master Boot Record (MBR) disks to the GPT format.

  Security Fix(es):

  * gdisk: possible out-of-bounds-write in LoadPartitionTable of gpt.cc (CVE-2020-0256)

  * gdisk: possible out-of-bounds-write in ReadLogicalParts of basicmbr.cc (CVE-2021-0308)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
