  - CVE-2013-0333
summary: |
  An updated rubygem-activesupport package that fixes one security issue is
  now available for Red Hat CloudForms.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Active Support provides support and utility
  classes used by the Ruby on Rails framework.

  A flaw was found in the way Active Support performed the parsing of JSON
  requests by translating them to YAML. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails
  application, perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication
  using a specially-created JSON request. (CVE-2013-0333)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Lawrence Pit of Mirror42 as the original
  reporter.

  Users of Red Hat CloudForms are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which resolves this issue. Users of CloudForms Cloud Engine must run
  "aeolus-services restart" and users of CloudForms System Engine must run
  "katello-service restart" for this update to take effect.
