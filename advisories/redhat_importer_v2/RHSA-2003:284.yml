  - CVE-2003-0694
summary: |
  Updated Sendmail packages that fix a potentially-exploitable vulnerability
  are now available.

  Sendmail is a widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA) and is included in all
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions.

  There is a bug in the prescan() function of Sendmail versions prior to and
  including 8.12.9. The sucessful exploitation of this bug can lead to heap
  and stack structure overflows.  Although no exploit currently exists, this
  issue is locally exploitable and may also be remotely exploitable.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2003-0694 to this issue.

  All users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing a
  backported patch which corrects these vulnerabilities.

  Red Hat would like to thank Michal Zalewski for finding and reporting this
  issue.
