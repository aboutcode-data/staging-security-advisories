  - CVE-2007-5794
summary: "An updated nss_ldap package that fixes a security issue and several bugs is\nnow available.\n\
  \nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response\
  \ Team.\n\nThe nss_ldap package contains the nss_ldap and pam_ldap modules. The\nnss_ldap\
  \ module is a plug-in which allows applications to retrieve\ninformation about users and groups\
  \ from a directory server. The pam_ldap\nmodule allows PAM-aware applications to use a directory\
  \ server to verify\nuser passwords.\n\nA race condition was discovered in nss_ldap which affected\
  \ certain\napplications which make LDAP connections, such as Dovecot. This could cause\nnss_ldap\
  \ to answer a request for information about one user with\ninformation about a different user.\
  \ (CVE-2007-5794)\n\nIn addition, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n\n* a build\
  \ error prevented the nss_ldap module from being able to use DNS to\ndiscover the location\
  \ of a directory server. For example, when the\n/etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file was\
  \ configured to use \"ldap\", but no\n\"host\" or \"uri\" option was configured in the /etc/ldap.conf\
  \ configuration\nfile, no directory server was contacted, and no results were returned.\n\n\
  * the \"port\" option in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration file on client\nmachines was ignored.\
  \ For example, if a directory server which you were\nattempting to use was listening on a\
  \ non-default port (i.e. not ports 389\nor 636), it was only possible to use that directory\
  \ server by including the\nport number in the \"uri\" option. In this updated package, the\
  \ \"port\" option\nworks as expected.\n\n* pam_ldap failed to change an expired password if\
  \ it had to follow a\nreferral to do so, which could occur, for example, when using a slave\n\
  directory server in a replicated environment. An error such as the\nfollowing occurred after\
  \ entering a new password: \"LDAP password\ninformation update failed: Can't contact LDAP\
  \ server Insufficient 'write'\nprivilege to the 'userPassword' attribute\"\n\nThis has been\
  \ resolved in this updated package.\n\n* when the \"pam_password exop_send_old\" password-change\
  \ method was\nconfigured in the /etc/ldap.conf configuration file, a logic error in the\n\
  pam_ldap module caused client machines to attempt to change a user's\npassword twice. First,\
  \ the pam_ldap module attempted to change the password\nusing the \"exop\" request, and then\
  \ again using an LDAP modify request.\n\n* on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1, rebuilding nss_ldap-253-5.el5\
  \ when the\nkrb5-*-1.6.1-17.el5 packages were installed failed due to an error such as\nthe\
  \ following:\n\n\t+ /builddir/build/SOURCES/dlopen.sh ./nss_ldap-253/nss_ldap.so\n\tdlopen()\
  \ of \"././nss_ldap-253/nss_ldap.so\" failed:\n\t./././nss_ldap-253/nss_ldap.so: undefined\
  \ symbol: request_key\n\terror: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.62652 (%build)\n\nThe\
  \ missing libraries have been added, which resolves this issue.\n\nWhen recursively enumerating\
  \ the set of members in a given group, the\nmodule would allocate insufficient space for storing\
  \ the set of member\nnames if the group itself contained other groups, thus corrupting the\
  \ heap.\nThis update includes a backported fix for this bug.\n\nUsers of nss_ldap should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct this issue and fix\
  \ these bugs."
