  - CVE-2005-0205
summary: "Updated kdenetwork packages that fix a file descriptor leak are now available.\n\n\
  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response\
  \ Team\n\nThe kdenetwork packages contain a collection of networking applications for\nthe\
  \ K Desktop Environment.\n\nA bug was found in the way kppp handles privileged file descriptors.\
  \  A\nmalicious local user could make use of this flaw to modify the /etc/hosts\nor /etc/resolv.conf\
  \ files, which could be used to spoof domain information. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and\
  \ Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0205 to this issue.\n\n\
  Please note that the default installation of kppp on Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux uses consolehelper\
  \ and is not vulnerable to this issue.  However, the\nkppp FAQ provides instructions for removing\
  \ consolehelper and running kppp\nsuid root, which is a vulnerable configuration.\n\nUsers\
  \ of kdenetwork should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\na backported patch,\
  \ and are not vulnerable to this issue."
