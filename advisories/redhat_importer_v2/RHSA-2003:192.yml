summary: |
  Updated KDE packages that resolve a vulnerability in KDE's SSL
  implementation are now available.

  KDE is a graphical desktop environment for the X Window System.

  KDE versions 2.2.2 and earlier have a vulnerability in their SSL
  implementation that makes it possible for users of Konqueror and other SSL
  enabled KDE software to fall victim to a man-in-the-middle attack.  Red Hat
  Linux 7.1 and 7.2 shipped with KDE packages that are vulnerable to this issue.

  Users of KDE should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain KDE
  2.2.2 with a backported patch to correct this vulnerability.
