  - CVE-2016-6186
summary: |
  An update for python-django is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Django. An attacker could exploit the unsafe usage of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML to forge content in the admin's add/change related popup. Element.textContent is now used to prevent XSS data execution. (CVE-2016-6186)

  Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue.
