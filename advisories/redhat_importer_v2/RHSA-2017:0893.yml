  - CVE-2017-2668
summary: |
  An update for 389-ds-base is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  389 Directory Server is an LDAP version 3 (LDAPv3) compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server administration.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the way 389-ds-base handled LDAP bind requests. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to make ns-slapd crash via a specially crafted LDAP bind request, resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-2668)

  Red Hat would like to thank Joachim Jabs (F24) for reporting this issue.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, the "deref" plug-in failed to dereference attributes that use distinguished name (DN) syntax, such as "uniqueMember". With this patch, the "deref" plug-in can dereference such attributes and additionally "Name and Optional UID" syntax. As a result, the "deref" plug-in now supports any syntax. (BZ#1435365)
