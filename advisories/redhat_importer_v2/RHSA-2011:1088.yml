  - CVE-2011-2503
summary: |
  Updated systemtap packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SystemTap is an instrumentation system for systems running the Linux
  kernel. The system allows developers to write scripts to collect data on
  the operation of the system.

  It was found that SystemTap did not perform proper module path sanity
  checking if a user specified a custom path to the uprobes module, used
  when performing user-space probing ("staprun -u"). A local user who is a
  member of the stapusr group could use this flaw to bypass intended
  module-loading restrictions, allowing them to escalate their privileges by
  loading an arbitrary, unsigned module. (CVE-2011-2502)

  A race condition flaw was found in the way the staprun utility performed
  module loading. A local user who is a member of the stapusr group could
  use this flaw to modify a signed module while it is being loaded,
  allowing them to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2011-2503)

  SystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
