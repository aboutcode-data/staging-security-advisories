summary: |
  CloudForms Common 1.1.2 is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat CloudForms is an on-premise hybrid cloud
  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product that lets you create and manage
  private and public clouds. It provides self-service computing resources to
  users in a managed, governed, and secure way.

  Three flaws were found in rubygem-rack. A remote attacker could use these
  flaws to perform a denial of service attack against applications using
  rubygem-rack. (CVE-2012-6109, CVE-2013-0183, CVE-2013-0184)

  It was found that documentation created by rubygem-rdoc was vulnerable to
  a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. If such documentation was accessible
  over a network, and a remote attacker could trick a user into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's session. As rubygem-rdoc is used for creating
  documentation for Ruby source files (such as classes, modules, and so on),
  it is not a common scenario to make such documentation accessible over the
  network. (CVE-2013-0256)

  It was found that ruby_parser from rubygem-ruby_parser created a temporary
  file in an insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a
  symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary files accessible to the
  application using ruby_parser. (CVE-2013-0162)

  Red Hat would like to thank Eric Hodel of RDoc upstream for reporting
  CVE-2013-0256. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Ermakov as the original
  reporter of CVE-2013-0256. The CVE-2013-0162 issue was discovered by
  Michael Scherer of the Red Hat Regional IT team.

  Refer to the CloudForms 1.1.2 Release Notes for further information about
  this release. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  Users of CloudForms Common are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages.
