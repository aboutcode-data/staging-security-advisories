summary: |
  Updated PHP packages that fix various security issues are now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Web server.

  A bug was found in the way PHP processes IFF and JPEG images. It is
  possible to cause PHP to consume CPU resources for a short period of time
  by supplying a carefully crafted IFF or JPEG image. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
  names CAN-2005-0524 and CAN-2005-0525 to these issues.

  A buffer overflow bug was also found in the way PHP processes EXIF image
  headers. It is possible for an attacker to construct an image file in such
  a way it could execute arbitrary instructions when processed by PHP. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2005-1042 to this issue.

  A denial of service bug was found in the way PHP processes EXIF image
  headers. It is possible for an attacker to cause PHP to enter an infinite
  loop for a short period of time by supplying a carefully crafted image file
  to PHP for processing. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1043 to this issue.

  Several bug fixes are also included in this update:

  - some performance issues in the unserialize() function have been fixed

  - the behaviour of the interpreter when handling integer overflow during
  conversion of a floating variable to an integer has been reverted to match
  the behaviour used upstream; the integer will now be wrapped rather than
  truncated

  - a fix for the virtual() function in the Apache httpd module which would
  flush the response prematurely

  - the hard-coded default "safe mode" setting is now "disabled" rather than
  "enabled"; to match the default /etc/php.ini setting

  - in the curl extension, safe mode was not enforced for 'file:///' URL
  lookups (CAN-2004-1392).

  Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported fixes for these issues.
