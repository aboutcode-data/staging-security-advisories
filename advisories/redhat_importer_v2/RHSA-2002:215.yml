  - CVE-2002-1175
summary: "Updated fetchmail packages are available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1,\n7.2, 7.3,\
  \ and 8.0 which close a remotely-exploitable vulnerability in\nunpatched versions of fetchmail\
  \ prior to 6.1.0.\n\nFetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended\
  \ for\nuse over on-demand TCP/IP links such as SLIP and PPP connections.  Two bugs\nhave been\
  \ found in the header parsing code in versions of Fetchmail prior\nto 6.1.0.  \n\nThe first\
  \ bug allows a remote attacker to crash Fetchmail by sending a\ncarefully crafted DNS packet.\
  \  The second bug allows a remote attacker to\ncarefully craft an email in such a way that\
  \ when it is parsed by Fetchmail\na heap overflow occurs, allowing remote arbitrary code execution.\n\
  \nBoth of these bugs are only exploitable if Fetchmail is being used in\nmultidrop mode (using\
  \ the \"multiple-local-recipients\" feature).\n\nAll users of Fetchmail are advised to upgrade\
  \ to the errata packages\ncontaining a backported fix which is not vulnerable to these issues."
