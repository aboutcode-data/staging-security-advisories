summary: "Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Critical security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which\
  \ give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links\
  \ in the References section.\n\nThe glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc),\
  \ POSIX \nthread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the \nname service\
  \ cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the \nsystem. Without these libraries,\
  \ the Linux system cannot function \ncorrectly.\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow was found\
  \ in the way the libresolv library\nperformed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could\
  \ create a\nspecially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or,\npotentially,\
  \ execute code with the permissions of the user running the\nlibrary. Note: this issue is\
  \ only exposed when libresolv is called from the\nnss_dns NSS service module. (CVE-2015-7547)\n\
  \nIt was discovered that the calloc implementation in glibc could return\nmemory areas which\
  \ contain non-zero bytes. This could result in unexpected\napplication behavior such as hangs\
  \ or crashes. (CVE-2015-5229)\n\nThe CVE-2015-7547 issue was discovered by the Google Security\
  \ Team and Red\nHat. Red Hat would like to thank Jeff Layton for reporting the\nCVE-2015-5229\
  \ issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The existing implementation of\
  \ the \"free\" function causes all memory\npools beyond the first to return freed memory directly\
  \ to the operating\nsystem as quickly as possible. This can result in performance degradation\n\
  when the rate of free calls is very high. The first memory pool (the main\npool) does provide\
  \ a method to rate limit the returns via M_TRIM_THRESHOLD,\nbut this method is not available\
  \ to subsequent memory pools.\n\nWith this update, the M_TRIM_THRESHOLD method is extended\
  \ to apply to all\nmemory pools, which improves performance for threads with very high amounts\n\
  of free calls and limits the number of \"madvise\" system calls. The change\nalso increases\
  \ the total transient memory usage by processes because the\ntrim threshold must be reached\
  \ before memory can be freed.\n\nTo return to the previous behavior, you can either set M_TRIM_THRESHOLD\n\
  using the \"mallopt\" function, or set the MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD environment\nvariable to\
  \ 0. (BZ#1298930)\n\n* On the little-endian variant of 64-bit IBM Power Systems (ppc64le),\
  \ a bug\nin the dynamic loader could cause applications compiled with profiling\nenabled to\
  \ fail to start with the error \"monstartup: out of memory\".\nThe bug has been corrected\
  \ and applications compiled for profiling now\nstart correctly. (BZ#1298956)\n\nAll glibc\
  \ users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches\
  \ to correct these issues."
