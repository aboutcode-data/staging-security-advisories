  Security Fix(es):

  * gluster-block: information disclosure through world-readable gluster-block log files (CVE-2020-10762)

  * heketi: gluster-block volume password details available in logs (CVE-2020-10763)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Earlier, the tcmu-runner did not give details about the file operations stuck at the backend glusterfs block hosting volume. With this change, the tcmu-runner is now able to log details about the file operations stuck at the backend glusterfs block hosting volume and this will help identify the root cause of the input/output errors easily. (BZ#1850361)

  * Earlier, there was no log rotation with gluster-block logs. With this release, log rotation is possible for gluster-block and tcmu-runner relevant logs. (BZ#1850365)

  * Earlier, heketi did not track all the changes made to volumes as part of device remove operation. With this release, heketi’s device remove operation is fully tracked and is based on a series of brick evict operations making the operation more reliable. (BZ#1850072)

  * An access flaw CVE-2020-13867 was found in targetcli due to which the files under ‘/etc/target’ and '/etc/target/backup' directory were widely accessible. With this release, the access flaw is fixed as a workaround in gluster-block to protect these files from any potential attacks for accessing sensitive information, until the flaw is resolved and made available in targetcli.(BZ#1850077)

  All Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
