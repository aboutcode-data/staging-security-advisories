summary: |
  An update for gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  GStreamer is a streaming media framework based on graphs of filters which operate on media data. The gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free package contains a collection of plug-ins for GStreamer.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in GStreamer's VMware VMnc video file format decoding plug-in. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using GStreamer to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-9445)

  * Multiple flaws were discovered in GStreamer's H.264 and MPEG-TS plug-ins. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause an application using GStreamer to crash. (CVE-2016-9809, CVE-2016-9812, CVE-2016-9813)
