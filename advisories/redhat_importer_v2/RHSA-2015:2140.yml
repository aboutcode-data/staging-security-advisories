  - CVE-2015-1782
summary: |
  Updated libssh2 packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The libssh2 packages provide a library that implements the SSH2 protocol.

  A flaw was found in the way the kex_agree_methods() function of libssh2
  performed a key exchange when negotiating a new SSH session. A
  man-in-the-middle attacker could use a crafted SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packet to
  crash a connecting libssh2 client. (CVE-2015-1782)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, libssh2 did not correctly adjust the size of the receive
  window while reading from an SSH channel. This caused downloads over
  the secure copy (SCP) protocol to consume an excessive amount of memory.
  A series of upstream patches has been applied on the libssh2 source code to
  improve handling of the receive window size. Now, SCP downloads work as
  expected. (BZ#1080459)

  * Prior to this update, libssh2 did not properly initialize an internal
  variable holding the SSH agent file descriptor, which caused the agent
  destructor to close the standard input file descriptor by mistake.
  An upstream patch has been applied on libssh2 sources to properly
  initialize the internal variable. Now, libssh2 closes only the file
  descriptors it owns. (BZ#1147717)

  All libssh2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing these
  updated packages, all running applications using libssh2 must be restarted
  for this update to take effect.
