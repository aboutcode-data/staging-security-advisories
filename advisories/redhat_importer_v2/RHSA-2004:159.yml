aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0179
summary: |
  Updated Subversion packages that fix a vulnerability in neon, exploitable by
  a malicious DAV server, are now available.

  Subversion is a concurrent version control system that uses inbuilt code
  from neon, an HTTP and WebDAV client library.

  Versions of the neon client library up to and including 0.24.4 have been
  found to contain a number of format string bugs.  An attacker could create
  a malicious WebDAV server in such a way as to allow arbitrary code
  execution on the client should a user connect to it using subversion.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0179 to this issue.

  This update includes a patch to correct this issue, and an upgrade to
  Subversion 0.27.0, the last version which is compatible with the database
  schema used by Subversion 0.17.0.  Users of Subversion are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages.
