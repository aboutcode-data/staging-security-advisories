  - CVE-2011-4111
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. qemu-kvm is the user-space component
  for running virtual machines using KVM.

  A flaw was found in the way qemu-kvm handled VSC_ATR messages when a guest
  was configured for a CCID (Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices) USB smart
  card reader in passthrough mode. An attacker able to connect to the port on
  the host being used for such a device could use this flaw to crash the
  qemu-kvm process on the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
  host. (CVE-2011-4111)

  All users of qemu-kvm should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
