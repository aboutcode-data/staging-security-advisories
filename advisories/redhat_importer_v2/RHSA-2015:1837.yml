  - CVE-2015-5225
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  A heap-based buffer overflow issue was found in the QEMU emulator's VNC
  display driver. It could occur while refreshing the VNC server's display
  surface using the vnc_refresh_server_surface() routine. A privileged guest
  user could use this flaw to corrupt the heap memory and crash the QEMU
  process instance, or to potentially use it to execute arbitrary code on the
  host. (CVE-2015-5225)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr
  Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc. for reporting this issue.

  All qemu-kvm-rhev users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual
  machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
