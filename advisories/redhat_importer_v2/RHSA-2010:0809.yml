  - CVE-2010-3765
summary: |
  Updated xulrunner packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  XULRunner provides the XUL Runtime environment for applications using the
  Gecko layout engine.

  A race condition flaw was found in the way XULRunner handled Document
  Object Model (DOM) element properties. Malicious HTML content could cause
  an application linked against XULRunner (such as Firefox) to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the application. (CVE-2010-3765)

  For technical details regarding this flaw, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 3.6.12. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All XULRunner users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the update,
  applications using XULRunner must be restarted for the changes to take
  effect.
