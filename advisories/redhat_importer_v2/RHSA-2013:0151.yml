  - CVE-2012-3546
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  It was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with
  another component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to
  FormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was
  possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator
  by appending "/j_security_check" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker
  with an authenticated session on an affected application could use this
  flaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not
  permitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.
  (CVE-2012-3546)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files, and any databases and database settings.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
