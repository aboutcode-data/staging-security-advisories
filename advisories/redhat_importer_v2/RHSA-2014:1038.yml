summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  It was found that several application-provided XML files, such as web.xml,
  content.xml, *.tld, *.tagx, and *.jspx, resolved external entities,
  permitting XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker able to deploy
  malicious applications to Tomcat could use this flaw to circumvent security
  restrictions set by the JSM, and gain access to sensitive information on
  the system. Note that this flaw only affected deployments in which Tomcat
  is running applications from untrusted sources, such as in a shared hosting
  environment. (CVE-2013-4590)

  It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a
  malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Apache Tomcat
  to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library
  descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML
  parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities
  and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications
  deployed on the same Apache Tomcat instance. (CVE-2014-0119)

  All Tomcat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be
  restarted for this update to take effect.
