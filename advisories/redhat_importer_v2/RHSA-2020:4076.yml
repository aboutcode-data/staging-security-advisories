summary: |
  An update for nss, nss-softokn, nss-util, and nspr is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications.

  Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: nss (3.53.1), nss-softokn (3.53.1), nss-util (3.53.1), nspr (4.25.0). (BZ#1804262, BZ#1804264, BZ#1804271, BZ#1804273)

  Security Fix(es):

  * nss: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key (CVE-2019-11719)

  * nss: Use-after-free in sftk_FreeSession due to improper refcounting (CVE-2019-11756)

  * nss: Check length of inputs for cryptographic primitives (CVE-2019-17006)

  * nss: Side channel attack on ECDSA signature generation (CVE-2020-6829)

  * nss: P-384 and P-521 implementation uses a side-channel vulnerable modular inversion function (CVE-2020-12400)

  * nss: ECDSA timing attack mitigation bypass (CVE-2020-12401)

  * nss: Side channel vulnerabilities during RSA key generation (CVE-2020-12402)

  * nss: CHACHA20-POLY1305 decryption with undersized tag leads to out-of-bounds read (CVE-2020-12403)

  * nss: PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be used for TLS 1.3 (CVE-2019-11727)

  * nss: TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest downgrade request sets client into invalid state (CVE-2019-17023)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Memory leak: libcurl leaks 120 bytes on each connection (BZ#1688958)

  * NSS does not set downgrade sentinel in ServerHello.random for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 (BZ#1712924)

  * Make TLS 1.3 work in FIPS mode (BZ#1724251)

  * Name Constraints validation: CN treated as DNS name even when syntactically invalid as DNS name (BZ#1737910)

  * x25519 allowed in FIPS mode (BZ#1754518)

  * When NSS_SDB_USE_CACHE not set, after curl access https, dentry increase but never released - consider alternative algorithm for benchmarking ACCESS call in sdb_measureAccess (BZ#1779325)

  * Running ipa-backup continuously causes httpd to crash and makes it irrecoverable (BZ#1804015)

  * nss needs to comply to the new SP800-56A rev 3 requirements (BZ#1857308)

  * KDF-self-tests-induced changes for nss in RHEL 7.9 (BZ#1870885)
