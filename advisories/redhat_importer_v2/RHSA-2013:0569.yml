  - CVE-2011-1096
summary: |
  An update for the JBoss Web Services component in JBoss Enterprise SOA
  Platform 4.3 CP05 and JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 which fixes
  one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the
  open source implementation of the Java EE suite of services and Portal
  services running atop JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  An attack technique was found against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when
  block ciphers were used in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading
  to the recovery of the entire plain text of a particular cryptogram by
  examining the differences between SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
  responses sent from JBoss Web Services. (CVE-2011-1096)

  Red Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for
  reporting this issue.

  Note: Manual action is required to apply this update. The CVE-2011-1096
  issue is an attack on the WS-Security standard itself. Using new
  Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) based algorithms for WS-Security encryption is
  the W3C suggested way of dealing with this issue. To use GCM algorithms in
  your application, update the encrypt element of all jboss-ws-security
  configuration to specify a GCM algorithm. The following is an example
  directive:

  encrypt type="x509v3" algorithm="aes-128-gcm" alias="wsse"

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss installation,
  including any databases, database settings, applications, configuration
  files, and so on.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3 CP05 and JBoss Enterprise
  Portal Platform 4.3 CP07 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are
  advised to apply this update.
