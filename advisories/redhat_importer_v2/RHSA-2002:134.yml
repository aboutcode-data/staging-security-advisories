  - CVE-2002-0653
summary: "Updated mod_ssl packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, 7.2,\nand 7.3.\
  \ These updates incorporate a fix for an incorrect bounds check in\nversions of mod_ssl up\
  \ to and including version 2.8.9.\n\nThe mod_ssl module provides strong cryptography for the\
  \ Apache Web\nserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security\n(TLS)\
  \ protocols.  Versions of mod_ssl prior to 2.8.10 are subject to a\nsingle NULL overflow that\
  \ can cause arbitrary code execution.\n\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the Apache\
  \ Web server has to be\nconfigured to allow overriding of configuration settings on a per-directory\n\
  basis, and untrusted local users must be able to modify a directory in\nwhich the server is\
  \ configured to allow overriding.  The local attacker may\nthen become the user that Apache\
  \ is running as (usually 'www' or 'nobody').  \n\nNote that regardless of this bug, local\
  \ users can obtain the same\nprivileges if the server is configured to allow them to create\
  \ CGI scripts\nwhich run as the Web server user, or if PHP is enabled but not configured\n\
  in \"safe mode\".\n\nThe errata packages contain versions of mod_ssl that have been patched\
  \ and\nare not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nPlease note that you must restart the httpd daemon\
  \ to use the updated\nmodule. For instructions on doing this, see the bottom of the Solutions\n\
  section below."
