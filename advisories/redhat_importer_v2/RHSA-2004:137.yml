summary: |
  Updated Ethereal packages that fix various security vulnerabilities are now
  available.

  Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

  Stefan Esser reported that Ethereal versions 0.10.1 and earlier contain
  stack overflows in the IGRP, PGM, Metflow, ISUP, TCAP, or IGAP dissectors.
   On a system where Ethereal is being run a remote attacker could send
  malicious packets that could cause Ethereal to crash or execute arbitrary
  code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0176 to this issue.

  Jonathan Heussser discovered that a carefully-crafted RADIUS packet could
  cause a crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0365 to this issue.

  Ethereal 0.8.13 to 0.10.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (crash) via a zero-length Presentation protocol selector.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0367 to this issue.

  Users of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a version of Ethereal that is not vulnerable to these issues.
