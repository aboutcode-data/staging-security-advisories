summary: "Updated gtk2 packages that fix several security flaws and bugs are now\navailable.\n\
  \nThe gtk2 package contains the GIMP ToolKit (GTK+), a library for creating\ngraphical user\
  \ interfaces for the X Window System. \n\nDuring testing of a previously fixed flaw in Qt\
  \ (CAN-2004-0691), a flaw was\ndiscovered in the BMP image processor of gtk2.  An attacker\
  \ could create a\ncarefully crafted BMP file which would cause an application to enter an\n\
  infinite loop and not respond to user input when the file was opened by a\nvictim.  The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2004-0753\
  \ to this issue.\n\nDuring a security audit Chris Evans discovered a stack and a heap overflow\n\
  in the XPM image decoder.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted XPM\nfile which could\
  \ cause an application linked with gtk2 to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code when\
  \ the file was opened by a victim. \n(CAN-2004-0782, CAN-2004-0783)\n\nChris Evans also discovered\
  \ an integer overflow in the ICO image decoder. \nAn attacker could create a carefully crafted\
  \ ICO file which could cause an\napplication linked with gtk2 to crash when the file was opened\
  \ by a victim.\n(CAN-2004-0788)\n\nThis updated gtk2 package also fixes a few key combination\
  \ bugs on various\nX servers, such as Hummingbird, ReflectionX, and X-Win32. If a server was\n\
  configured to use the Swiss German, Swiss French, or France French keyboard\nlayouts, Mode_Switched\
  \ characters were unable to be entered within GTK\nbased applications.\n\nUsers of gtk2 are\
  \ advised to upgrade to these packages which contain\nbackported patches and are not vulnerable\
  \ to these issues."
