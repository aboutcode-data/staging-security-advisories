  - CVE-2016-7117
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within __sys_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, guest virtual machines (VMs) on a Hyper-V server cluster got in some cases rebooted during the graceful node failover test, because the host kept sending heartbeat packets independently of guests responding to them. This update fixes the bug by properly responding to all the heartbeat messages in the queue, even if they are pending. As a result, guest VMs no longer get rebooted under the described circumstances. (BZ#1397737)

  * From Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 to 6.8, the IPv6 routing cache occasionally showed incorrect values. This update fixes the DST_NOCOUNT mechanism, and the IPv6 routing cache now shows correct values. (BZ#1391973)

  * Previously, memory corruption by copying data into the wrong memory locations sometimes occurred, because the __copy_tofrom_user() function was returning incorrect values. This update fixes the __copy_tofrom_user() function so that it no longer returns larger values than the number of bytes it was asked to copy. As a result, memory corruption no longer occurs in he described scenario. (BZ#1398182)
