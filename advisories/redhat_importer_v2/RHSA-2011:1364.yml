  - CVE-2011-3365
summary: |
  Updated kdelibs packages that fix one security issue and add one
  enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The kdelibs packages provide libraries for the K Desktop Environment (KDE).

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the KSSL (KDE SSL Wrapper) API. An
  attacker could supply a specially-crafted SSL certificate (for example, via
  a web page) to an application using KSSL, such as the Konqueror web
  browser, causing misleading information to be presented to the user,
  possibly tricking them into accepting the certificate as valid.
  (CVE-2011-3365)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * kdelibs provided its own set of trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
  certificates. This update makes kdelibs use the system set from the
  ca-certificates package, instead of its own copy. (BZ#743951)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct this issue and add this enhancement. The desktop must be
  restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
