summary: |
  JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2, which fixes multiple security issues and
  several bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution
  that provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor
  JBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss ON 2.4.2 release serves as a replacement for JBoss ON 2.4.1,
  and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the JBoss ON 2.4.2 Release Notes
  for information on the most significant of these changes. The Release
  Notes will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  JBoss ON did not properly verify security tokens, allowing an unapproved
  agent to connect as an approved agent. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to spoof the identity of an approved agent, allowing them to hijack
  the approved agent's session and steal its security token. As a result,
  the attacker could retrieve sensitive data about the server the hijacked
  agent was running on, including JMX credentials. (CVE-2012-0052)

  JBoss ON sometimes allowed agent registration to succeed when the
  registration request did not include a security token. This is a feature
  designed to add convenience. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  spoof the identity of an approved agent and pass a null security token,
  allowing them to hijack the approved agent's session, and steal its
  security token. As a result, the attacker could retrieve sensitive data
  about the server the hijacked agent was running on, including JMX
  credentials. (CVE-2012-0062)

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was
  susceptible to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to cause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by
  sending an HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map
  to the same hash value. This update introduces a limit on the number of
  parameters and headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The
  default limit is 512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults
  can be changed by setting the
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "server/$PROFILE/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2011-4858)

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the JBoss ON
  administration interface. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was
  logged into the JBoss ON administration interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's JBoss ON session. (CVE-2011-3206)

  JBoss ON did not verify that a user had the proper modify resource
  permissions when they attempted to delete a plug-in configuration update
  from the group connection properties history. This could allow such a user
  to delete a plug-in configuration update from the audit trail. Note that a
  user without modify resource permissions cannot use this flaw to make
  configuration changes. (CVE-2011-4573)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4858.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON
  installation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,
  and so on).

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 2.4.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2.
