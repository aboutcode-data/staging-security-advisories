summary: "Updated openvswitch packages that fix one security issue are now available \nfor Red\
  \ Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Important security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\n\
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nOpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing\nPlatform-as-a-Service\
  \ (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private\ncloud deployments.\n\nA buffer overflow\
  \ flaw was discovered in the OVS processing of MPLS labels. \nA remote attacker able to deliver\
  \ a frame containing a malicious MPLS label \nthat would be processed by OVS could trigger\
  \ the flaw and use the resulting \nmemory corruption to cause a denial of service (DoS) or,\
  \ possibly, execute \narbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2074)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Open\
  \ vSwitch Project for reporting these \nissues. Upstream acknowledges Kashyap Thimmaraju and\
  \ Bhargava Shastry as \nthe original reporters of CVE-2016-2074.\n\nThis update includes the\
  \ following images:\n\nopenshift3/openvswitch:v3.1.1.6-9\naep3_beta/openvswitch:v3.1.1.6-9\n\
  openshift3/node:v3.1.1.6-16\naep3_beta/node:v3.1.1.6-16\n\nAll openvswitch users are advised\
  \ to upgrade to this updated package, which \ncontains a backported patch to correct this\
  \ issue."
