  - CVE-2007-4465
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Application Stack.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular and freely-available Web server.

  A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module. On sites where
  a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully
  crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that
  request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker
  could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a
  malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if
  using a threaded Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-3847)

  A flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module.  On sites where directory
  listings are used, and the AddDefaultCharset directive has been removed
  from the configuration, a cross-site-scripting attack may be possible
  against browsers which do not correctly derive the response character set
  following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)

  Users of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
