  - CVE-2015-0235
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9
  Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update
  Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 and 6.5 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name
  Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
  Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  A heap-based buffer overflow was found in glibc's
  __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function, which is used by the gethostbyname()
  and gethostbyname2() glibc function calls. A remote attacker able to make
  an application call either of these functions could use this flaw to
  execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2015-0235)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qualys for reporting this issue.

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
