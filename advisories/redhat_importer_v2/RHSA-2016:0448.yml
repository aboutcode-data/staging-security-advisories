  - CVE-2015-7560
summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  A flaw was found in the way Samba handled ACLs on symbolic links.
  An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain access to an arbitrary
  file or directory by overwriting its ACL. (CVE-2015-7560)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Jeremy Allison (Google) and the Samba team as the
  original reporters.

  All samba users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
