  - CVE-2007-1354
summary: |
  Updated versions of JBoss Application Server that fix a security issue are
  now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The JBoss Application Server is a powerful J2EE application server.

  A flaw was found in the JMX Console fine-grained Access Control feature.
  An administrator with 'Read Mode' privileges to the JMX service could
  gain additional privileges if another administrator who had 'Write Mode'
  privileges was logged into and accessed the console at the same time.
  (CVE-2007-1354)

  Note: Fine-grained Access Control was first added to JBoss Application
  Server in June 2006; earlier versions are not affected by this issue.

  Known vulnerable versions include: JBoss AS 4.0.2.GA_CP02, 4.0.2.GA_CP03,
  4.0.2.GA_CP04, 4.0.5.GA, 4.0.5_CP01, and 4.0.5_CP02.

  This vulnerability is rectified and does not affect JBoss AS releases
  5.0.0.Beta2, 4.2.0.GA, 4.0.5.SP1, 3.2.8.SP2, and cumulative patches
  4.0.5.GA_CP03, 4.0.2.GA_CP05, 4.0.4.GA_CP06, 4.0.3.SP1_CP05, and
  3.2.8.SP1_CP01.

  Users with an affected installation of JBoss Application Server who rely on
  granting read-only privileges to the console should upgrade to one of these
  updated versions.
