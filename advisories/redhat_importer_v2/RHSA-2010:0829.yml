summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
  is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Supplementary.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
  Player web browser plug-in.

  This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
  vulnerabilities are detailed on the Adobe security page APSB10-26, listed
  in the References section.

  Multiple security flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed
  certain SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
  specially-crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page
  containing the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2010-3639,
  CVE-2010-3640, CVE-2010-3641, CVE-2010-3642, CVE-2010-3643, CVE-2010-3644,
  CVE-2010-3645, CVE-2010-3646, CVE-2010-3647, CVE-2010-3648, CVE-2010-3649,
  CVE-2010-3650, CVE-2010-3652, CVE-2010-3654)

  An input validation flaw was discovered in flash-plugin. Certain server
  encodings could lead to a bypass of cross-domain policy file restrictions,
  possibly leading to cross-domain information disclosure. (CVE-2010-3636)

  During testing, it was discovered that there were regressions with Flash
  Player on certain sites, such as fullscreen playback on YouTube.  Despite
  these regressions, we feel these security flaws are serious enough to
  update the package with what Adobe has provided.

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
  upgrades Flash Player to version 10.1.102.64.
