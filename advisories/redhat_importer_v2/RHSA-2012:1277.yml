summary: |
  Updated Messaging component packages that fix two security issues, multiple
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG 2.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
  based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
  standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
  messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
  messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
  vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
  client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
  libraries and management tools.

  It was discovered that the Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not allow the
  number of connections from clients to be restricted. A malicious client
  could use this flaw to open an excessive amount of connections, preventing
  other legitimate clients from establishing a connection to qpidd.
  (CVE-2012-2145)

  To address CVE-2012-2145, new qpidd configuration options were introduced:
  max-negotiate-time defines the time during which initial protocol
  negotiation must succeed, connection-limit-per-user and
  connection-limit-per-ip can be used to limit the number of connections per
  user and client host IP. Refer to the qpidd manual page for additional
  details.

  It was discovered that qpidd did not require authentication for "catch-up"
  shadow connections created when a new broker joins a cluster. A malicious
  client could use this flaw to bypass client authentication. (CVE-2012-3467)

  This update also fixes multiple bugs and adds enhancements. Documentation
  for these changes will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
  document linked to in the References section.

  All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.2 are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and
  add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes.
  After installing the updated packages, stop the cluster by either running
  "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or "qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one
  of the cluster nodes. Once stopped, restart the cluster with "service qpidd
  start" on all nodes for the update to take effect.
