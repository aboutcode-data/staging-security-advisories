summary: |
  This is the 6-month notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.3 Advanced Mission Critical (AMC).

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Advanced Mission Critical for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 will be retired
  as of March 31, 2014, and support will no longer be provided. Accordingly,
  Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including critical impact
  security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.3 AMC after that date. In addition, technical support through Red
  Hat's Global Support Services will no longer be provided after March 31,
  2014.

  Note: This notification applies only to those customers with subscriptions
  for Advanced Mission Critical Support (AMC) channels for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.3.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.3 to a more recent release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6. As
  a benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 release (AMC is available on 5.9) or Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 release (AMC is available on 6.2 and 6.4, and planned for 6.6).
