summary: |
  This is the one-year notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS). This notice applies only to
  those customers subscribed to the Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) channel
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in the Customer Portal.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Life Cycle Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 will be retired
  as of March 31, 2017, and active support will no longer be provided.
  Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including
  Critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 ELS after March 31, 2017. In addition, on-going
  technical support through Red Hat's Global Support Services will be limited
  as described under "non-current minor releases" in the Knowledge Base
  article located at https://access.redhat.com/articles/64664 after
  this date.

  We encourage customers to migrate from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 to a more
  recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a benefit of the Red Hat
  subscription model, customers can use their active subscriptions to entitle
  any system on any currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux release.
