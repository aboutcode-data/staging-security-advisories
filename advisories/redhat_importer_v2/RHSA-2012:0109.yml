summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues and
  various bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A heap overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM emulated the e1000
  network interface card. A privileged guest user in a virtual machine whose
  network interface is configured to use the e1000 emulated driver could use
  this flaw to crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
  host. (CVE-2012-0029)

  An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
  in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
  cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
  sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
  (CVE-2011-4576)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the RFC 3779 implementation in
  OpenSSL. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make an application using
  OpenSSL exit unexpectedly by providing a specially-crafted X.509
  certificate that has malformed RFC 3779 extension data. (CVE-2011-4577)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
  handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
  an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
  (CVE-2011-4619)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nicolae Mogoreanu for reporting CVE-2012-0029.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2009-5029 and CVE-2011-4609 (glibc issues)

  CVE-2012-0056 (kernel issue)

  CVE-2011-4108 and CVE-2012-0050 (openssl issues)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, it was possible to begin a Hypervisor installation without
  any valid disks to install to.

  Now, if no valid disks are found for Hypervisor installation, a message is
  displayed informing the user that there are no valid disks for
  installation. (BZ#781471)

  * Previously, the user interface for the Hypervisor did not indicate
  whether the system was registered with Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic or RHN
  Satellite. As a result, customers could not easily determine the
  registration status of their Hypervisor installations.

  The TUI has been updated to display the registration status of the
  Hypervisor. (BZ#788223)

  * Previously, autoinstall would fail if the firstboot or reinstall options
  were passed but local_boot or upgrade were not passed. Now, neither the
  local_boot or upgrade parameters are required for autoinstall. (BZ#788225)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.
