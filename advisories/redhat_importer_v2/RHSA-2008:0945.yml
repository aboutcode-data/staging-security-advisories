summary: "An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes several security issues is\nnow available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Supplementary.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\n[Updated 18th November 2008]\n\
  The erratum has been updated to include references to the additional\nCVE-named issues that\
  \ were not public at the time of release. The security\nimpact of the erratum has also been\
  \ upgraded to Critical. No changes have\nbeen made to the packages.\n\nThe flash-plugin package\
  \ contains a Firefox-compatible Adobe Flash Player\nWeb browser plug-in.\n\nA flaw was found\
  \ in the way Adobe Flash Player wrote content to the\nclipboard. A malicious SWF file could\
  \ populate the clipboard with a URL\nthat could cause the user to mistakenly load an attacker-controlled\
  \ URL.\n(CVE-2008-3873)\n\nA flaw was found which allowed Adobe Flash Player's ActionScript\
  \ to\ninitiate file uploads and downloads without user interaction.\nFileReference.browse\
  \ and FileReference.download calls can now only be\ninitiated via user interaction, such as\
  \ mouse-clicks or key-presses on the\nkeyboard. (CVE-2008-4401)\n\nA flaw was found in Adobe\
  \ Flash Player's display of the Settings Manager\ncontent. A malicious SWF file could trick\
  \ the user into unknowingly\nclicking a link or dialog. This could then give the malicious\
  \ SWF file\npermission to access the local machine's camera or microphone.\n(CVE-2008-4503)\n\
  \nFlaws were found in the way Flash Player restricted the interpretation and\nusage of cross-domain\
  \ policy files.  A remote attacker could use Flash\nPlayer to conduct cross-domain and cross-site\
  \ scripting attacks\n(CVE-2007-4324, CVE-2007-6243). This update provides enhanced fixes for\n\
  these issues.\n\nAdobe Flash Player 10 also includes bug fixes and feature enhancements\n\
  including:\n\n* improved stability on the Linux platform by fixing a race condition issue\n\
  in sound output.\n\n* new support for custom filters and effects, native 3D transformation\
  \ and\nanimation, advanced audio processing, a new, more flexible text engine, and\nGPU hardware\
  \ acceleration. \n\nFor more information on new features and enhancements, see the Adobe Flash\n\
  Player site and the Adobe Labs Release Notes.\n\nNote: some users may have installed a 3rd-party\
  \ component, libflashsupport,\nfor older versions of Flash Player. Adobe Flash Player 10 no\
  \ longer\nsupports libflashsupport. Users are advised to remove libflashsupport if\nthey have\
  \ it installed.\n\nAll users of Adobe Flash Player should upgrade to this updated package,\n\
  which contains Flash Player version 10.0.12.36."
