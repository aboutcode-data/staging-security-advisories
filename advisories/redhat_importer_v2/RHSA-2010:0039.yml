  - CVE-2009-3736
summary: |
  Updated gcc and gcc4 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The gcc and gcc4 packages include, among others, C, C++, and Java GNU
  compilers and related support libraries. libgcj contains a copy of GNU
  Libtool's libltdl library.

  A flaw was found in the way GNU Libtool's libltdl library looked for
  libraries to load. It was possible for libltdl to load a malicious library
  from the current working directory. In certain configurations, if a local
  attacker is able to trick a local user into running a Java application
  (which uses a function to load native libraries, such as
  System.loadLibrary) from within an attacker-controlled directory containing
  a malicious library or module, the attacker could possibly execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Java
  application. (CVE-2009-3736)

  All gcc and gcc4 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running Java
  applications using libgcj must be restarted for this update to take effect.
