  - CVE-2014-8157
  - CVE-2014-8158
summary: |
  Updated jasper packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  JasPer is an implementation of Part 1 of the JPEG 2000 image compression
  standard.

  An off-by-one flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in
  the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file
  could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8157)

  An unrestricted stack memory use flaw was found in the way JasPer decoded
  JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application
  using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8158)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT
  acknowledges pyddeh as the original reporter.

  All JasPer users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. All applications using
  the JasPer libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.
