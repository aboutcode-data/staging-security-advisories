aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0488
  - CVE-2004-0493
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix a buffer overflow in mod_ssl and a remotely
  triggerable memory leak are now available.

  The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
  freely-available Web server.

  A stack buffer overflow was discovered in mod_ssl that could be triggered
  if using the FakeBasicAuth option. If mod_ssl was sent a client certificate
  with a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters, a stack overflow
  occured if FakeBasicAuth had been enabled. In order to exploit this issue
  the carefully crafted malicious certificate would have had to be signed by
  a Certificate Authority which mod_ssl is configured to trust. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-0488 to this issue.

  A remotely triggered memory leak in the Apache HTTP Server earlier than
  version 2.0.50 was also discovered.  This allowed a remote attacker to
  perform a denial of service attack against the server by forcing it to
  consume large amounts of memory.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0493 to this issue.

  Users of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches that address these issues.
