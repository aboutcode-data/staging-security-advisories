aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0851
  - CVE-2004-0081
summary: |
  Updated OpenSSL packages that fix a remote denial of service vulnerability
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and
  Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
  general purpose cryptography library.

  Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool
  uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can
  lead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop).  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-0081 to this issue.

  Testing performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered
  an issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l
  which could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service
  attack if used where stack space is limited.  The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851
  to this issue.

  These updated packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that
  protect against these issues.

  NOTE: Because server applications are affected by this issue, users are
  advised to either restart all services using OpenSSL functionality or
  restart their system after installing these updated packages.
