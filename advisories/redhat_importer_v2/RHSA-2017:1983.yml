  - CVE-2017-7486
summary: |
  An update for postgresql is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: postgresql (9.2.21). (BZ#1449706)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that some selectivity estimation functions did not check user privileges before providing information from pg_statistic, possibly leaking information. A non-administrative database user could use this flaw to steal some information from tables they are otherwise not allowed to access. (CVE-2017-7484)

  * It was found that the pg_user_mappings view could disclose information about user mappings to a foreign database to non-administrative database users. A database user with USAGE privilege for this mapping could, when querying the view, obtain user mapping data, such as the username and password used to connect to the foreign database. (CVE-2017-7486)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Robert Haas as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7484; and Andrew Wheelwright as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7486.
