  - CVE-2007-5365
summary: "An updated dhcp package that corrects a security flaw is now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe dhcp package provides the ISC Dynamic Host\
  \ Configuration Protocol\n(DHCP) server and relay agent, dhcpd. DHCP is a protocol that allows\n\
  devices to get their own network configuration information from a server.\n\nA bug was found\
  \ in the way dhcpd validates certain DHCP protocol options. \nA malicious DHCP client could\
  \ send a carefully crafted DHCP request and cause\ndhcpd to crash or possibly execute arbitrary\
  \ code. (CVE-2007-5365)\n\nAll users of dhcp should upgrade to this updated package, which\
  \ contains a\nbackported patch that resolves this issue."
