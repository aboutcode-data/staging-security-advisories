  - CVE-2008-3283
summary: "Updated redhat-ds-base and redhat-ds-admin packages are now available that\nfix security\
  \ issues and various bugs.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nRed Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant\
  \ directory server.\n\nMultiple memory leaks were identified in the Directory Server. An\n\
  unauthenticated remote attacker could use these flaws to trigger high\nmemory consumption\
  \ in the Directory Server, possibly causing it to crash or\nterminate unexpectedly when running\
  \ out of available memory. (CVE-2008-3283)\n\n[Updated 3rd October 2008]\nUlf Weltman of Hewlett\
  \ Packard discovered a flaw in the way Directory\nServer handled LDAP search requests with\
  \ patterns. A remote attacker with\naccess to the LDAP service could create a search request\
  \ that, when the\nsearch pattern was matched against specially crafted data records, caused\n\
  Directory Server to use a large amount of CPU time because the Directory \nServer did not\
  \ impose time limits on such search requests. In this updated \npackage, Directory Server\
  \ imposes the nsslapd-timelimit attribute on the \npattern-search query run times. This attribute\
  \ has the default limit of \n3600 seconds; to shorten this limit, use ldapmodify to change\
  \ the \nnsslapd-timelimit value in the cn=config entry. (CVE-2008-2930)\n\nIn addition to\
  \ these security fixes, the following bugs have been fixed in\nthese updated packages:\n\n\
  * The change sequence numbers in multi-master replication had a built-in\ntime skew to accommodate\
  \ differences in the clocks on master servers. Under\ncertain circumstances, this skew exceeded\
  \ the maximum allowable skew,\ncausing replication to stop entirely.\n \n* If an entry with\
  \ a large attribute value, such as over 32KB, was\nreplicated, the replication could fail\
  \ with a DB_BUFFER_SMALL error. \n\n* If a password policy attribute such as accountunlocktime\
  \ was added to an\nentry, the server would attempt to replicate that attribute, causing\n\
  replication to fail. \n\n*  The Directory Server would crash during the index operation if\n\
  replication was configured and an attribute value was scheduled to be\ndeleted which was indexed\
  \ or had an attribute subtype which was indexed.\n\n* On x86_64 systems, recursively adding\
  \ groups as members to other groups\ncould crash the server because the stack size for the\
  \ memberOf plug-in on\n64-bit systems was hard-coded to 256KB, regardless of the ulimit value.\n\
  \n* Attempting to register a new Directory Server instance to a remote\nConfiguration Directory\
  \ would fail; a new -u option has been added to the\nsetup-ds-admin.pl script to resolve this.\n\
  \n* Creating a new Directory Server instance through the Console would fail\nif it was attempted\
  \ after the Admin Server was restarted.\n\n* If the Directory Server Console was set to use\
  \ SSL, then clicking the\n\"Manage Certificates\" in the Console threw a Java exception and\
  \ the window\nwould not open.\n\n* A problem in the SASL IO handling meant that memory was\
  \ not reallocated\nafter SASL binds. For example, a simple bind coming immediately after a\n\
  SASL bind might have failed.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.0 should upgrade to\
  \ these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues."
