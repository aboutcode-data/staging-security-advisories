  - CVE-2014-0205
  - CVE-2014-5077
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled
  reference counting when requeuing futexes during futex_wait(). A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to zero out the reference counter of
  an inode or an mm struct that backs up the memory area of the futex, which
  could lead to a use-after-free flaw, resulting in a system crash or,
  potentially, privilege escalation. (CVE-2014-0205)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled
  simultaneous connections between the same hosts. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-5077)

  The security impact of the CVE-2014-0205 issue was discovered by Mateusz
  Guzik of Red Hat.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
