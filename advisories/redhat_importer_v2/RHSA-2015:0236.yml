  This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
  6.1.0. It includes bug fixes, which are documented in the readme.txt file
  included with the patch files. The following security issues are addressed
  in this release:

  It was found that Apache WSS4J (Web Services Security for Java), as used by
  Apache CXF with the TransportBinding, did not, by default, properly enforce
  all security requirements associated with SAML SubjectConfirmation methods.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform various types of spoofing
  attacks on web service endpoints secured by WSS4J that rely on SAML for
  authentication. (CVE-2014-3623)

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Spring Framework
  sanitized certain URLs. A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain any
  file on the file system that was also accessible to the process in which
  the Spring web application was running. (CVE-2014-3625)

  Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
  installation instructions.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this
  security update.
