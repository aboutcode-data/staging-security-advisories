summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse and A-MQ 6.1.0 Rollup Patch 1, which addresses several
  security issues, multiple bug fixes, and adds various enhancements, is now
  available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
  flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.
  Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
  messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

  This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
  6.1.0. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the
  readme.txt file included with the patch files. The following security
  issues are addressed in this release:

  It was discovered that Apache Shiro authenticated users without specifying
  a user name or a password when used in conjunction with an LDAP back end
  that allowed unauthenticated binds. (CVE-2014-0074)

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  It was found that the SecurityTokenService (STS), provided as a part of
  Apache CXF, could under certain circumstances accept invalid SAML tokens as
  valid. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted SAML token to gain
  access to an application that uses STS for validation of SAML tokens.
  (CVE-2014-0034)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache CXF created error
  messages for certain POST requests. A remote attacker could send a
  specially crafted request which, when processed by an application using
  Apache CXF, could consume an excessive amount of memory on the system,
  possibly triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. (CVE-2014-0109)

  It was found that when a large invalid SOAP message was processed by Apache
  CXF, it could be saved to a temporary file in the /tmp directory. A remote
  attacker could send a specially crafted SOAP message that, when processed
  by an application using Apache CXF, would use an excessive amount of disk
  space, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0110)

  It was found that Jolokia was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CSRF) attacks. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web
  page that, when visited by a user logged in to Jolokia, could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary methods on MBeans exposed via JMX.
  (CVE-2014-0168)

  It was found that the Spring Framework did not, by default, disable the
  resolution of URI references in a DTD declaration when processing
  user-provided XML documents. By observing differences in response times, an
  attacker could identify valid IP addresses on the internal network with
  functioning web servers. (CVE-2014-0225)

  It was discovered that UsernameTokens were sent in plain text by an Apache
  CXF client that used a Symmetric EncryptBeforeSigning password policy.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to obtain the user name
  and password used by the client application using Apache CXF.
  (CVE-2014-0035)

  A flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could
  allow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a
  series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on
  the server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2014-0193)

  Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
  installation instructions.

  Red Hat would like to thank James Roper of Typesafe for reporting the
  CVE-2014-0193 issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this
  security update.
