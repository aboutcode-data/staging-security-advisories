summary: "Updated Mozilla packages fixing various bugs and security issues are now\navailable.\n\
  \n[Updated 18 July 2003]\nOur Mozilla packages were found to be incompatible with Galeon.\
  \ Updated\nversions of Galeon are now included for Red Hat Linux 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0. \nIn addition\
  \ new builds of Mozilla for Red Hat Linux 8.0 are included as the\nprevious packages were\
  \ built with the wrong compiler.\n\n[Updated 31 July 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux\
  \ on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.\n\nMozilla is an open source Web browser.  \n\nA heap-based\
  \ buffer overflow in Netscape and Mozilla allows remote\nattackers to execute arbitrary code\
  \ via a jar: URL referencing a\nmalformed .jar file, which overflows a buffer during decompression.\
  \ This\nissue affects versions Mozilla packages for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3,\nand 8.0.\n\
  \nThese errata packages upgrade Mozilla to version 1.0.2, which is not\nvulnerable to this\
  \ issue. Mozilla 1.0.2 also contains a number of other\nstability and security enhancements."
