  - CVE-2013-1896
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
  handled merge requests. An attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted
  merge request that contains URIs that are not configured for DAV, causing
  the httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2013-1896)

  All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.
