summary: |
  Updated nss and nspr packages that fix multiple security issues, several
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform
  independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

  A flaw was found in the way NSS handled invalid handshake packets. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to cause a TLS/SSL client using NSS to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2013-5605)

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2013-1620 released via RHSA-2013:1135
  introduced a regression causing NSS to read uninitialized data when a
  decryption failure occurred. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause
  a TLS/SSL server using NSS to crash. (CVE-2013-1739)

  An integer overflow flaw was discovered in both NSS and NSPR's
  implementation of certification parsing on 64-bit systems. A remote
  attacker could use these flaws to cause an application using NSS or NSPR to
  crash. (CVE-2013-1741, CVE-2013-5607)

  It was discovered that NSS did not reject certificates with incompatible
  key usage constraints when validating them while the verifyLog feature was
  enabled. An application using the NSS certificate validation API could
  accept an invalid certificate. (CVE-2013-5606)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting
  CVE-2013-1741, CVE-2013-5606, and CVE-2013-5607. Upstream acknowledges
  Tavis Ormandy as the original reporter of CVE-2013-1741, Camilo Viecco as
  the original reporter of CVE-2013-5606, and Pascal Cuoq, Kamil Dudka, and
  Wan-Teh Chang as the original reporters of CVE-2013-5607.

  In addition, the nss package has been upgraded to upstream version 3.15.3,
  and the nspr package has been upgraded to upstream version 4.10.2.
  These updates provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous versions. (BZ#1033478, BZ#1020520)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The RHBA-2013:1318 update introduced a regression that prevented the use
  of certificates that have an MD5 signature. This update fixes this
  regression and certificates that have an MD5 signature are once again
  supported. To prevent the use of certificates that have an MD5 signature,
  set the "NSS_HASH_ALG_SUPPORT" environment variable to "-MD5". (BZ#1033499)

  Users of NSS and NSPR are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which fix these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
  update, applications using NSS or NSPR must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
