summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way certain strings were
  converted to Double objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause
  Tomcat to hang via a specially-crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2010-4476)

  A flaw was found in the Tomcat NIO (Non-Blocking I/O) connector. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory
  condition) via a specially-crafted request containing a large NIO buffer
  size request value. (CVE-2011-0534)

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
