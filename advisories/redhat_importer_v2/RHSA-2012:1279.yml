  - CVE-2012-3467
summary: |
  Updated Messaging component packages that fix one security issue, multiple
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG 2.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
  based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
  standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
  messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
  messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
  vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
  client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
  libraries and management tools.

  It was discovered that the Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not require
  authentication for "catch-up" shadow connections created when a new broker
  joins a cluster. A malicious client could use this flaw to bypass client
  authentication. (CVE-2012-3467)

  This update also fixes multiple bugs and adds enhancements. Documentation
  for these changes will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
  document linked to in the References section.

  All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.2 are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and
  add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes.
  After installing the updated packages, stop the cluster by either running
  "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or "qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one
  of the cluster nodes. Once stopped, restart the cluster with "service qpidd
  start" on all nodes for the update to take effect.
