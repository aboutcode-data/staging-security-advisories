  - CVE-2011-1769
summary: |
  Updated systemtap packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  SystemTap is an instrumentation system for systems running the Linux
  kernel, version 2.6. Developers can write scripts to collect data on the
  operation of the system.

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the way SystemTap handled malformed
  debugging information in DWARF format. When SystemTap unprivileged mode was
  enabled, an unprivileged user in the stapusr group could use this flaw to
  crash the system. Additionally, a privileged user (root, or a member of the
  stapdev group) could trigger this flaw when tricked into instrumenting a
  specially-crafted ELF binary, even when unprivileged mode was not enabled.
  (CVE-2011-1769)

  SystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
