summary: |
  Updated ruby193-rubygem-actionpack packages that fix one security issue are
  now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the
  view components.

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled
  wildcard segments in routes with implicit rendering. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to retrieve arbitrary local files accessible to a Ruby
  on Rails application using the aforementioned routes via a specially
  crafted request. (CVE-2014-0130)

  All ruby193-rubygem-actionpack users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
