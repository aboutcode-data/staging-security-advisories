summary: |
  An updated firefox package that fixes several security bugs is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

  A bug was found in the way Firefox processes XBM image files. If a user
  views a specially crafted XBM file, it becomes possible to execute
  arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2701 to
  this issue.

  A bug was found in the way Firefox processes certain Unicode
  sequences. It may be possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running
  Firefox if the user views a specially crafted Unicode sequence. (CAN-2005-2702)

  A bug was found in the way Firefox makes XMLHttp requests. It is possible
  that a malicious web page could leverage this flaw to exploit other proxy
  or server flaws from the victim's machine. It is also possible that this
  flaw could be leveraged to send XMLHttp requests to hosts other than the
  originator; the default behavior of the browser is to disallow this.
  (CAN-2005-2703)

  A bug was found in the way Firefox implemented its XBL interface. It may be
  possible for a malicious web page to create an XBL binding in such a way
  that would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution with chrome permissions.
  Please note that in Firefox 1.0.6 this issue is not directly exploitable
  and will need to leverage other unknown exploits. (CAN-2005-2704)

  An integer overflow bug was found in Firefox's JavaScript engine. Under
  favorable conditions, it may be possible for a malicious web page to
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CAN-2005-2705)

  A bug was found in the way Firefox displays about: pages. It is possible
  for a malicious web page to open an about: page, such as about:mozilla, in
  such a way that it becomes possible to execute JavaScript with chrome
  privileges. (CAN-2005-2706)

  A bug was found in the way Firefox opens new windows. It is possible for a
  malicious web site to construct a new window without any user interface
  components, such as the address bar and the status bar. This window could
  then be used to mislead the user for malicious purposes. (CAN-2005-2707)

  A bug was found in the way Firefox processes URLs passed to it on the
  command line. If a user passes a malformed URL to Firefox, such as clicking
  on a link in an instant messaging program, it is possible to execute
  arbitrary commands as the user running Firefox. (CAN-2005-2968)

  Users of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package that
  contains Firefox version 1.0.7 and is not vulnerable to these issues.
