summary: "Updated OpenSSL packages that fix several remote denial of service\nvulnerabilities\
  \ are now available.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\
  \ and\nTransport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength\ngeneral purpose\
  \ cryptography library.\n\nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS\
  \ Test Tool\nuncovered a null-pointer assignment in the do_change_cipher_spec() function\n\
  in OpenSSL 0.9.6c-0.9.6l and 0.9.7a-0.9.7c.  A remote attacker could\nperform a carefully-crafted\
  \ SSL/TLS handshake against a server that used\nthe OpenSSL library in such a way as to cause\
  \ OpenSSL to crash. Depending\non the application this could lead to a denial of service.\
  \  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\n\
  CAN-2004-0079 to this issue.\n\nStephen Henson discovered a flaw in the SSL/TLS handshaking\
  \ code when using\nKerberos ciphersuites in OpenSSL 0.9.7a-0.9.7c.  A remote attacker could\n\
  perform a carefully-crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured\nto use Kerberos\
  \ ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. \nMost applications have no ability\
  \ to use Kerberos ciphersuites and are\ntherefore unaffected by this issue.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0112 to\nthis issue.\n\
  \nTesting performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool\nuncovered a\
  \ bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can\nlead to a denial of service\
  \ attack (infinite loop).  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0081 to this issue.  This issue affects only the OpenSSL\n\
  compatibility packages shipped with Red Hat Linux 9.\n\nThese updated packages contain patches\
  \ provided by the OpenSSL group that\nprotect against these issues.\n\nNOTE: Because server\
  \ applications are affected by this issue, users are\nadvised to either restart all services\
  \ using OpenSSL functionality or\nrestart their system after installing these updated packages."
