  - CVE-2009-4033
summary: |
  An updated acpid package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  acpid is a daemon that dispatches ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power
  Interface) events to user-space programs.

  It was discovered that acpid could create its log file ("/var/log/acpid")
  with random permissions on some systems. A local attacker could use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges if the log file was created as
  world-writable and with the setuid or setgid bit set. (CVE-2009-4033)

  Please note that this flaw was due to a Red Hat-specific patch
  (acpid-1.0.4-fd.patch) included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 acpid
  package.

  Users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
