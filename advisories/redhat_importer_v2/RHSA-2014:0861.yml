  - CVE-2014-4607
summary: |
  Updated lzo packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the lzo library decompressed
  certain archives compressed with the LZO algorithm. An attacker could
  create a specially crafted LZO-compressed input that, when decompressed by
  an application using the lzo library, would cause that application to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-4607)

  Red Hat would like to thank Don A. Bailey from Lab Mouse Security for
  reporting this issue.

  All lzo users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the lzo library must be restarted or the
  system rebooted.
