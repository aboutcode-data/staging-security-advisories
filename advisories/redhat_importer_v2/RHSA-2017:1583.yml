summary: |
  An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled responses containing a DNAME answer. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS response. (CVE-2016-8864)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND processed a response to an ANY query. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS response. (CVE-2016-9131)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled a query response containing inconsistent DNSSEC information. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS response. (CVE-2016-9147)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled an unusually-formed DS record response. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS response. (CVE-2016-9444)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled a query response containing CNAME or DNAME resource records in an unusual order. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS response. (CVE-2017-3137)

  Red Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Tony Finch (University of Cambridge) and Marco Davids (SIDN Labs) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-8864.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * ICANN is planning to perform a Root Zone DNSSEC Key Signing Key (KSK) rollover during October 2017. Maintaining an up-to-date KSK is essential for ensuring that validating DNS resolvers continue to function following the rollover. (BZ#1459648)
