  - CVE-2002-1160
summary: |
  Updated PAM packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and
  8.0.  These packages correct a bug in pam_xauth's handling of authorization
  data for the root user.

  [Updated 16 April 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  The pam_xauth module is used to forward xauth information from user to user
  in applications such as 'su'.

  Andreas Beck discovered that versions of pam_xauth supplied with Red Hat
  Linux since version 7.1 would forward authorization information from the
  root account to unprivileged users. This could be used by a local attacker
  to gain access to an administrator's X session. In order to exploit this
  vulnerability, the attacker would have to get the administrator, as root,
  to use su to the account belonging to the attacker.

  Users of pam_xauth are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which
  contain a patch that adds ACL (access control list) functionality to
  pam_xauth and disallows root forwarding by default.

  Versions of pam_xauth included in Red Hat Linux 7 and earlier disabled
  passing of credentials from the root account to unprivileged users by
  default and are not affected by this issue.

  Thanks to Andreas Beck for reporting this issue.
