  - CVE-2011-4339
summary: |
  An updated ipmitool package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The ipmitool package contains a command line utility for interfacing with
  devices that support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)
  specification. IPMI is an open standard for machine health, inventory, and
  remote power control.

  It was discovered that the IPMI event daemon (ipmievd) created its process
  ID (PID) file with world-writable permissions. A local user could use this
  flaw to make the ipmievd init script kill an arbitrary process when the
  ipmievd daemon is stopped or restarted. (CVE-2011-4339)

  All users of ipmitool are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the IPMI event daemon (ipmievd) will be restarted automatically.
