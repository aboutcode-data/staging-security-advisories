aliases:
  - CVE-2002-0651
  - CVE-2002-0684
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages are available to fix two vulnerabilities in the
  resolver functions.

  The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
  multiple programs on the system.

  A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the way the glibc
  resolver handles the resolution of network names and addresses via DNS (as
  per Internet RFC 1011).  Version 2.2.5 of glibc and earlier versions are
  affected.  A system would be vulnerable to this issue if the
  "networks" database in /etc/nsswitch.conf includes the "dns" entry.  By
  default, Red Hat Linux ships with "networks" set to "files" and
  is therefore not vulnerable to this issue.  (CAN-2002-0684)

  A second, related, issue is a bug in the glibc-compat packages,  which
  provide compatibility for applications compiled against glibc version
  2.0.x.  Applications compiled against this version (such as those
  distributed with early Red Hat Linux releases 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2) could also
  be vulnerable to this issue.  (CAN-2002-0651)

  These errata packages for Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2 on the Itanium
  architecture also include a fix for the strncpy implementation in some
  boundary cases.

  All users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain patches to
  the glibc and glibc-compat libraries and therefore are not vulnerable to
  these issues.
