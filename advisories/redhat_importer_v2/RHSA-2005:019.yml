summary: "Updated libtiff packages that fix various integer overflows are now available.\n\n\
  The libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating TIFF\n(Tagged Image File\
  \ Format) image format files.\n\niDEFENSE has reported an integer overflow bug that affects\
  \ libtiff. An\nattacker who has the ability to trick a user into opening a malicious TIFF\n\
  file could cause the application linked to libtiff to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary\
  \ code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the\
  \ name CAN-2004-1308 to this issue. \n\nDmitry V. Levin reported another integer overflow\
  \ in the tiffdump \nutility.  An atacker who has the ability to trick a user into opening\
  \ a\nmalicious TIFF file with tiffdump could possibly execute arbitrary code. \nThe Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1183\
  \ to this issue. \n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\n\
  backported fixes for these issues."
