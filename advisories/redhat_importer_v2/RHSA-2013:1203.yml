  It was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected
  from HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing
  a gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to
  HTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)

  It was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead
  to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)
