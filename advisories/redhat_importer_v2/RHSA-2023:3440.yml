summary: |
  An update for python-flask is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform
  17.0 (Wallaby).

  of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,

  Flask is called a “micro-framework” because the idea to keep the core
  simple but extensible. There is no database abstraction layer, no form
  validation or anything else where different libraries already exist that
  can handle that. However Flask knows the concept of extensions that can add
  this functionality into your application as if it was implemented in Flask
  itself. There are currently extensions for object relational mappers, form
  validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and
  more.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary:
  Cookie header (CVE-2023-30861)
