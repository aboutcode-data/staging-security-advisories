  - CVE-2005-1704
summary: "Updated elfutils packages that address a minor security issue and various\nother issues\
  \ are now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red\
  \ Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nThe elfutils packages contain a number of utility programs\
  \ and libraries\nrelated to the creation and maintenance of executable code.\n\nThe elfutils\
  \ packages that originally shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4\nwere GPL-licensed versions\
  \ which lacked some functionality. Previous\nupdates provided fully functional versions of\
  \ elfutils only under the OSL\nlicense. This update provides a fully functional, GPL-licensed\
  \ version of\nelfutils. \n\nIn the OSL-licensed elfutils versions provided in previous updates,\
  \ some\ntools could sometimes crash when given corrupted input files.  (CVE-2005-1704)\n\n\
  Also, when the eu-strip tool was used to create separate debuginfo files\nfrom relocatable\
  \ objects such as kernel modules (.ko), the resulting\ndebuginfo files (.ko.debug) were sometimes\
  \ corrupted.  Both of these\nproblems are fixed in the new version.\n\nUsers of elfutils should\
  \ upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues."
