summary: |
  An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with the Block driver for iSCSI images support (virtio-blk) is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow issue. The flaw could occur while processing iSCSI asynchronous I/O ioctl(2) calls. A user inside a guest could exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in denial of service, or potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code with QEMU-process privileges on the host. (CVE-2016-5126)

  * Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with the virtio framework is vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue. It was found that a malicious guest user could submit more requests than the virtqueue size permits. Processing a request allocates a VirtQueueElement results in unbounded memory allocation on the host controlled by the guest. (CVE-2016-5403)

  Red Hat would like to thank hongzhenhao (Marvel Team) for reporting CVE-2016-5403.
