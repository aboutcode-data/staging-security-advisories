summary: |
  Updated squid packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
  supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  requests when the SSL Bump feature was enabled. A remote attacker could
  send specially crafted requests that could cause Squid to crash.

  Upstream acknowledges Mathias Fischer and Fabian Hugelshofer from Open
  Systems AG as the original reporters.

  update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.
