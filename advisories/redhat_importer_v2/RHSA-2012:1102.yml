summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  A flaw was found in the way the Pidgin MSN protocol plug-in processed text
  that was not encoded in UTF-8. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash Pidgin by sending a specially-crafted MSN message. (CVE-2012-1178)

  An input validation flaw was found in the way the Pidgin MSN protocol
  plug-in handled MSN notification messages. A malicious server or a remote
  attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin by sending a specially-crafted
  MSN notification message. (CVE-2012-2318)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Pidgin MXit protocol plug-in. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin by sending a MXit
  message containing specially-crafted emoticon tags. (CVE-2012-3374)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting the
  CVE-2012-3374 issue. Upstream acknowledges Ulf Härnhammar as the original
  reporter of CVE-2012-3374.

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Pidgin must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
