  An update for the Apache ActiveMQ component of Fuse Message Broker 5.5.1
  that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Fuse Message Broker is a messaging platform based on Apache ActiveMQ that
  provides SOA infrastructure to connect processes across heterogeneous
  systems.

  It was found that, by default, the Apache ActiveMQ web console did not
  require authentication. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the
  state of the Apache ActiveMQ environment, obtain sensitive information, or
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-3060)

  This update delivers a README file which describes how to manually
  configure an XML properties file to fix this flaw. Back up existing Fuse
  Message Broker configuration files before making changes.
