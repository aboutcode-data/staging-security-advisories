summary: "Updated httpd packages that include fixes for security issues are now\navailable.\n\
  \nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web\
  \ server.\n\nFour issues have been discovered affecting releases of the Apache HTTP 2.0\n\
  Server, up to and including version 2.0.50:\n\nTesting using the Codenomicon HTTP Test Tool\
  \ performed by the Apache\nSoftware Foundation security group and Red Hat uncovered an input\n\
  validation issue in the IPv6 URI parsing routines in the apr-util library. \nIf a remote attacker\
  \ sent a request including a carefully crafted URI, an\nhttpd child process could be made\
  \ to crash.  This issue is not believed to\nallow arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux.  This issue\nalso does not represent a significant denial of service attack as requests\n\
  will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes.  The Common\nVulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0786 to this issue.\n\
  \nThe Swedish IT Incident Centre (SITIC) reported a buffer overflow in the\nexpansion of environment\
  \ variables during configuration file parsing.  This\nissue could allow a local user to gain\
  \ 'apache' privileges if an httpd\nprocess can be forced to parse a carefully crafted .htaccess\
  \ file written\nby a local user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2004-0747 to this issue.\n\nAn issue was discovered in the mod_ssl\
  \ module which could be triggered if\nthe server is configured to allow proxying to a remote\
  \ SSL server.  A\nmalicious remote SSL server could force an httpd child process to crash\
  \ by\nsending a carefully crafted response header.  This issue is not believed to\nallow execution\
  \ of arbitrary code.  This issue also does not represent a\nsignificant Denial of Service\
  \ attack as requests will continue to be\nhandled by other Apache child processes.  The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0751\
  \ to\nthis issue.\n\nAn issue was discovered in the mod_dav module which could be triggered\
  \ for\na location where WebDAV authoring access has been configured.  A malicious\nremote\
  \ client which is authorized to use the LOCK method could force an\nhttpd child process to\
  \ crash by sending a particular sequence of LOCK\nrequests.  This issue does not allow execution\
  \ of arbitrary code.  This\nissue also does not represent a significant Denial of Service\
  \ attack as\nrequests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes.  The\n\
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0809\
  \ to this issue. \n\nUsers of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated packages,\n\
  which contain backported patches that address these issues."
