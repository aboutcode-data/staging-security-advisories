  - CVE-2014-2015
summary: |
  Updated freeradius packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free Remote
  Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server, designed to allow
  centralized authentication and authorization for a network.

  A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the FreeRADIUS rlm_pap
  module handled long password hashes. An attacker able to make radiusd
  process a malformed password hash could cause the daemon to crash.
  (CVE-2014-2015)

  The freeradius packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.2.6, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,
  including:

  * The number of dictionaries have been updated.

  * This update implements several Extensible Authentication Protocol
  (EAP) improvements.

  * A number of new expansions have been added, including: %{randstr:...},
  %{hex:...}, %{sha1:...}, %{base64:...}, %{tobase64:...}, and
  %{base64tohex:...}.

  * Hexadecimal numbers (0x...) are now supported in %{expr:...} expansions.

  * This update adds operator support to the rlm_python module.

  * The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and DHCP relay code have
  been finalized.

  * This update adds the rlm_cache module to cache arbitrary attributes.

  For a complete list of bug fixes and enhancements provided by this rebase,
  see the freeradius changelog linked to in the References section.

  (BZ#1078736)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The /var/log/radius/radutmp file was configured to rotate at one-month
  intervals, even though this was unnecessary. This update removes
  /var/log/radius/radutmp from the installed logrotate utility configuration
  in the /etc/logrotate.d/radiusd file, and /var/log/radius/radutmp is no
  longer rotated. (BZ#904578)

  * The radiusd service could not write the output file created by the
  raddebug utility. The raddebug utility now sets appropriate ownership to
  the output file, allowing radiusd to write the output. (BZ#921563)

  * After starting raddebug using the "raddebug -t 0" command, raddebug
  exited immediately. A typo in the special case comparison has been fixed,
  and raddebug now runs for 11.5 days in this situation. (BZ#921567)

  * MS-CHAP authentication failed when the User-Name and MS-CHAP-User-Name
  attributes used different encodings, even when the user provided correct
  credentials. Now, MS-CHAP authentication properly handles mismatching
  character encodings. Authentication with correct credentials no longer
  fails in this situation. (BZ#1060319)

  * Automatically generated default certificates used the SHA-1 algorithm
  message digest, which is considered insecure. The default certificates now
  use the more secure SHA-256 algorithm message digest. (BZ#1135439)

  * During the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) validation, radiusd
  terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault after attempting to
  access the next update field that was not provided by the OCSP responder.
  Now, radiusd does not crash in this situation and instead continues to
  complete the OCSP validation. (BZ#1142669)

  * Prior to this update, radiusd failed to work with some of the more recent
  MikroTIK attributes, because the installed directory.mikrotik file did not
  include them. This update adds MikroTIK attributes with IDs up to 22 to
  dictionary.mikrotik, and radiusd now works as expected with these
  attributes. (BZ#1173388)

  Users of freeradius are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
  update, the radiusd service will be restarted automatically.
