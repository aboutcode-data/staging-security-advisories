summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add an enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A flaw was found in sctp_packet_config() in the Linux kernel's Stream
  Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3432,
  Important)

  * A missing integer overflow check was found in snd_ctl_new() in the Linux
  kernel's sound subsystem. A local, unprivileged user on a 32-bit system
  could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2010-3442, Important)

  * A heap overflow flaw in the Linux kernel's Transparent Inter-Process
  Communication protocol (TIPC) implementation could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3859, Important)

  * An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable
  Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2010-3865, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the Xenbus code for the unified block-device I/O
  interface back end. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service on the host system running the Xen hypervisor.
  (CVE-2010-3699, Moderate)

  * Missing sanity checks were found in setup_arg_pages() in the Linux
  kernel. When making the size of the argument and environment area on the
  stack very large, it could trigger a BUG_ON(), resulting in a local denial
  of service. (CVE-2010-3858, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in inet_csk_diag_dump() in the Linux kernel's module for
  monitoring the sockets of INET transport protocols. By sending a netlink
  message with certain bytecode, a local, unprivileged user could cause a
  denial of service. (CVE-2010-3880, Moderate)

  * Missing sanity checks were found in gdth_ioctl_alloc() in the gdth driver
  in the Linux kernel. A local user with access to "/dev/gdth" on a 64-bit
  system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2010-4157, Moderate)

  * The fix for Red Hat Bugzilla bug 484590 as provided in RHSA-2009:1243
  introduced a regression. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4161, Moderate)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Bluetooth HCI UART
  driver in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4242, Moderate)

  * It was found that a malicious guest running on the Xen hypervisor could
  place invalid data in the memory that the guest shared with the blkback and
  blktap back-end drivers, resulting in a denial of service on the host
  system. (CVE-2010-4247, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's CPU time clocks implementation for
  the POSIX clock interface. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4248, Moderate)

  * Missing initialization flaws in the Linux kernel could lead to
  information leaks. (CVE-2010-3876, CVE-2010-4083, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-3442,
  CVE-2010-4161, and CVE-2010-4083; Thomas Pollet for reporting
  CVE-2010-3865; Brad Spengler for reporting CVE-2010-3858; Nelson Elhage for
  reporting CVE-2010-3880; Alan Cox for reporting CVE-2010-4242; and Vasiliy
  Kulikov for reporting CVE-2010-3876.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds an enhancement. Documentation
  for the bug fixes and the enhancement will be available shortly from the
  Technical Notes document, linked to in the References section.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the enhancement
  noted in the Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update
  to take effect.
