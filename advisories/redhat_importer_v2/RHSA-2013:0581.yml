  - CVE-2013-0338
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation
  of various XML standards.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 performed string
  substitutions when entity values for entity references replacement was
  enabled. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that,
  when processed by an application linked against libxml2, would lead to
  excessive CPU consumption. (CVE-2013-0338)

  All users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The desktop must
  be restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
