  - CVE-2008-3281
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix a security issue are now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 26th August 2008]
  The original fix used in this errata caused some applications using
  the libxml2 library in an unexpected way to crash when used with updated
  libxml2 packages. We have updated the packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  3, 4 and 5 to use a different fix that does not break affected
  applications.

  The libxml2 packages provide a library that allows you to manipulate XML
  files. It includes support to read, modify, and write XML and HTML files.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way libxml2 processes certain
  content. If an application linked against libxml2 processes malformed XML
  content, it could cause the application to stop responding. (CVE-2008-3281)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andreas Solberg for responsibly disclosing this
  issue.

  All users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
