  - CVE-2011-1096
summary: |
  An update for the JBoss Web Services component in JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 which fixes one security issue is now
  available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
  which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam.

  An attack technique was found against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when
  block ciphers were used in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading
  to the recovery of the entire plain text of a particular cryptogram by
  examining the differences between SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
  responses sent from JBoss Web Services. (CVE-2011-1096)

  Red Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for
  reporting this issue.

  Note: Manual action is required to apply this update. The CVE-2011-1096
  issue is an attack on the WS-Security standard itself. Using new
  Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) based algorithms for WS-Security encryption is
  the W3C suggested way of dealing with this issue. To use GCM algorithms in
  your application, update the encrypt element of all jboss-ws-security
  configuration to specify a GCM algorithm. The following is an example
  directive:

  encrypt type="x509v3" algorithm="aes-128-gcm" alias="wsse"

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
  and configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
