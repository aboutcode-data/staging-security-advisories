  - CVE-2009-0696
summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix a security issue and a bug are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message packets
  containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet that could cause named to
  exit with an assertion failure. (CVE-2009-0696)

  Note: even if named is not configured for dynamic updates, receiving such
  a specially-crafted dynamic update packet could still cause named to exit
  unexpectedly.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * when running on a system receiving a large number of (greater than 4,000)
  DNS requests per second, the named DNS nameserver became unresponsive, and
  the named service had to be restarted in order for it to continue serving
  requests. This was caused by a deadlock occurring between two threads that
  led to the inability of named to continue to service requests. This
  deadlock has been resolved with these updated packages so that named no
  longer becomes unresponsive under heavy load. (BZ#512668)

  All BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
  update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.
