summary: "Updated openoffice.org packages to correct security issues are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  \n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nOpenOffice.org is an office productivity\
  \ suite that includes desktop\napplications such as a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation\
  \ manager,\nformula editor, and drawing program.\n\nJohn Heasman discovered a stack overflow\
  \ in the StarCalc parser in\nOpenOffice.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted StarCalc\
  \ file\nthat could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code\nif the\
  \ file was opened by a victim. (CVE-2007-0238)\n\nFlaws were discovered in the way OpenOffice.org\
  \ handled hyperlinks.  An\nattacker could create an OpenOffice.org document which could run\
  \ commands\nif a victim opened the file and clicked on a malicious hyperlink. \n(CVE-2007-0239)\n\
  \nAll users of OpenOffice.org are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain\
  \ a backported fix to correct this issue."
