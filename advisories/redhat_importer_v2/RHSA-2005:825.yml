  - CVE-2005-2672
summary: |
  Updated lm_sensors packages that fix an insecure file issue are now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The lm_sensors package includes a collection of modules for general SMBus
  access and hardware monitoring. This package requires special support which
  is not in standard version 2.2 kernels.

  A bug was found in the way the pwmconfig tool creates temporary files. It
  is possible that a local attacker could leverage this flaw to overwrite
  arbitrary files located on the system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project has assigned the name CVE-2005-2672 to this issue.

  Users of lm_sensors are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch that resolves this issue.
