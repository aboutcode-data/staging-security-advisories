  - CVE-2005-4872
  - CVE-2006-7227
summary: |
  Updated pcre packages that correct security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 15 November 2007]
  Further analysis of these flaws in PCRE has led to the single CVE
  identifier CVE-2006-7224 being split into three separate identifiers and a
  re-analysis of the risk of each of the flaws.  We are therefore updating
  the text of this advisory to use the correct CVE names for the two flaws
  fixed by these erratum packages, and downgrading the security impact of
  this advisory from critical to important.  No changes have been made to the
  packages themselves.

  PCRE is a Perl-compatible regular expression library.

  Flaws were found in the way PCRE handles certain malformed regular
  expressions. If an application linked against PCRE, such as Konqueror,
  parses a malicious regular expression, it may be possible to run arbitrary
  code as the user running the application. (CVE-2005-4872, CVE-2006-7227)

  Users of PCRE are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct these issues.
