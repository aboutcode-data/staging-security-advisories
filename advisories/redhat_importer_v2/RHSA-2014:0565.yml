summary: |
  Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.2.3 and fix one security issue, several bugs, and add various
  enhancements are now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the security auditing functionality provided by PicketBox
  and JBossSX, both security frameworks for Java applications, used a
  world-readable audit.log file to record sensitive information. A local user
  could possibly use this flaw to gain access to the sensitive information in
  the audit.log file. (CVE-2014-0059)

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.2.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.3 Release Notes, linked to in
  the References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
