summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function
  in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
  implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP
  packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-0008, Important)

  * a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ip6_dst_lookup_tail()
  function in the Linux kernel. An attacker on the local network could
  trigger this flaw by sending IPv6 traffic to a target system, leading to a
  system crash (kernel OOPS) if dst->neighbour is NULL on the target system
  when receiving an IPv6 packet. (CVE-2010-0437, Important)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * programs compiled on x86, and that also call sched_rr_get_interval(),
  were silently corrupted when run on 64-bit systems. With this update, when
  such programs attempt to call sched_rr_get_interval() on 64-bit systems,
  sys32_sched_rr_get_interval() is called instead, which resolves this issue.
  (BZ#557682)

  * the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0079 introduced a
  regression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using
  the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for
  such devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid
  options:

  "Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported
  not setting wol"

  This update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for
  network devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#559333)

  * a number of bugs have been fixed in the copy_user routines for Intel 64
  and AMD64 systems, one of which could have possibly led to data corruption.
  (BZ#568305)

  * on some systems, a race condition in the inode-based file event
  notifications implementation caused soft lockups and the following
  messages:

  "BUG: warning at fs/inotify.c:181/set_dentry_child_flags()"
  "BUG: soft lockup - CPU#[x] stuck for 10s!"

  This update resolves this race condition, and also removes the inotify
  debugging code from the kernel, due to race conditions in that code.
  (BZ#568662)

  * if a program that calls posix_fadvise() were compiled on x86, and then
  run on a 64-bit system, that program could experience various problems,
  including performance issues and the call to posix_fadvise() failing,
  causing the program to not run as expected or even abort. With this update,
  when such programs attempt to call posix_fadvise() on 64-bit systems,
  sys32_fadvise64() is called instead, which resolves this issue. This update
  also fixes other 32-bit system calls that were mistakenly called on 64-bit
  systems (including systems running the kernel-xen kernel). (BZ#569595)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
