  - CVE-2013-0256
summary: |
  This update fixes one security issue in multiple rubygem packages for
  Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  It was found that documentation created by RDoc was vulnerable to a
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. If such documentation was accessible
  over a network, and a remote attacker could trick a user into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's session. As RDoc is used for creating
  documentation for Ruby source files (such as classes, modules, and so on),
  it is not a common scenario to make such documentation accessible over the
  network. (CVE-2013-0256)

  This update provides a number of updated rubygem packages that have had
  their documentation regenerated with a corrected version of RDoc.

  Red Hat would like to thank Eric Hodel of RDoc upstream for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Ermakov as the original reporter.

  Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct this issue.
