summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes several security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Extras, Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 Extras, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Firefox-compatible Adobe Flash Player
  Web browser plug-in.

  Several input validation flaws were found in the way Flash Player displayed
  certain content. These may have made it possible to execute arbitrary code
  on a victim's machine, if the victim opened a malicious Adobe Flash file.
  (CVE-2007-0071, CVE-2007-6019)

  A flaw was found in the way Flash Player established TCP sessions to remote
  hosts. A remote attacker could, consequently, use Flash Player to conduct a
  DNS rebinding attack. (CVE-2007-5275, CVE-2008-1655)

  A flaw was found in the way Flash Player restricted the interpretation and
  usage of cross-domain policy files. A remote attacker could use Flash
  Player to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting attacks.
  (CVE-2007-6243, CVE-2008-1654)

  A flaw was found in the way Flash Player interacted with web browsers. An
  attacker could use malicious content presented by Flash Player to conduct a
  cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2007-6637)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains Flash Player version 9.0.124.0 and resolves these issues.
