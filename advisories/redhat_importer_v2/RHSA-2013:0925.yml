  An updated rhev-guest-tools-iso package that fixes two security issues and
  two bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-guest-tools-iso package contains tools and drivers. These tools
  and drivers are required by supported Windows guest operating systems
  when installed as guests on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

  An unquoted search path flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization agent was installed on Windows. Depending on the
  permissions of the directories in the unquoted search path, a local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to have a binary of their choosing
  executed with SYSTEM privileges. (CVE-2013-2151)

  An unquoted search path flaw was found in the way the SPICE service was
  installed on Windows. Depending on the permissions of the directories in
  the unquoted search path, a local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
  have a binary of their choosing executed with SYSTEM privileges.
  (CVE-2013-2152)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, when trying to uninstall rhev-guest-tools in Windows
  Server 2003 (both 32-bit and 64-bit), an error event was created in the
  event viewer saying "The BalloonService service hung on starting", even
  though the package was uninstalled correctly. Now, the balloon service
  executable is no longer registered meaning the service is no longer running
  by default and rhev-guest-tools can be uninstalled without any error
  messages. (BZ#860225, BZ#880278)

  All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization users are advised to upgrade to this
  updated rhev-guest-tools-iso package, which resolves these issues.
