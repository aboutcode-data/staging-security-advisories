  - CVE-2012-0029
summary: |
  Updated xen packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
  managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  A heap overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU emulated the e1000 network
  interface card. A privileged guest user in a virtual machine whose network
  interface is configured to use the e1000 emulated driver could use this
  flaw to crash QEMU or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.
  (CVE-2012-0029)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nicolae Mogoreanu for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Adding support for jumbo frames introduced incorrect network device
  expansion when a bridge is created. The expansion worked correctly with the
  default configuration, but could have caused network setup failures when a
  user-defined network script was used. This update changes the expansion so
  network setup will not fail, even when a user-defined network script is
  used. (BZ#797191)

  * A bug was found in xenconsoled, the Xen hypervisor console daemon. If
  timestamp logging for this daemon was enabled (using both the
  XENCONSOLED_TIMESTAMP_HYPERVISOR_LOG and XENCONSOLED_TIMESTAMP_GUEST_LOG
  options in "/etc/sysconfig/xend"), xenconsoled could crash if the guest
  emitted a lot of information to its serial console in a short period of
  time. Eventually, the guest would freeze after the console buffer was
  filled due to the crashed xenconsoled. Timestamp logging is disabled by
  default. (BZ#797836)

  All xen users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
