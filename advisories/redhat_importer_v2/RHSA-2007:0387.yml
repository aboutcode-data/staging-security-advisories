  - CVE-2007-3798
summary: "Updated tcpdump packages that fix a security issue and functionality bugs\nare now\
  \ available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\n\
  Hat Security Response Team.\n\nTcpdump is a command line tool for monitoring network traffic.\n\
  \nMoritz Jodeit discovered a denial of service bug in the tcpdump IEEE\n802.11 processing\
  \ code. An attacker could inject a carefully crafted frame\nonto the IEEE 802.11 network that\
  \ could crash a running tcpdump session if\na certain link type was explicitly specified.\
  \ (CVE-2007-1218)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in tcpdump's BGP processing code.\
  \ An\nattacker could execute arbitrary code with the privilege of the pcap user\nby injecting\
  \ a crafted frame onto the network. (CVE-2007-3798)\n\nIn addition, the following bugs have\
  \ been addressed: \n\n* if called with -C and -W switches, tcpdump would create the first\n\
  savefile with the privileges of the user that executed tcpdump (usually\nroot), rather than\
  \ with ones of the pcap user.  This could result in the\ninability to save the complete traffic\
  \ log file properly without the\nimmediate notice of the user running tcpdump.\n\n* the arpwatch\
  \ service initialization script would exit prematurely,\nreturning a successful exit status\
  \ incorrectly and preventing the status\ncommand from running in case networking is not available.\n\
  \nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain backported\
  \ patches that correct these issues."
