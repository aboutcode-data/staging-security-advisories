  - CVE-2007-4994
summary: "Updated rhpki-util, rhpki-common, and rhpki-ca packages that fix a security\nissue\
  \ are now available for Red Hat Certificate System 7.2.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nRed Hat Certificate\
  \ System (RHCS) is an enterprise software system designed\nto manage enterprise Public Key\
  \ Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.\n\nIt was found that new revocations performed while a\
  \ Certificate Revocation\nList (CRL) was being generated could potentially cause revoked certificates\n\
  at the upper end of the serial number range to not appear on the CRL for a\nperiod of time.\
  \  A user who has a revoked but otherwise valid certificate\ncould take advantage of this\
  \ issue and bypass the revocation list, although\nin practice they would have no way of influencing\
  \ which revoked certificate\nentries were missing or the time period.  (CVE-2007-4994)\n\n\
  The updated packages apply a bug fix for a 404 error caused by the server \nnot handling OCSP\
  \ requests in the GET method.\n\nUsers of Red Hat Certificate System should upgrade to these\
  \ updated\npackages, which contain a patch to correct this issue."
