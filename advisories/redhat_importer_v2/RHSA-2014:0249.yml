summary: |
  Updated postgresql packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
  (DBMS).

  Multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the date/time
  implementation of PostgreSQL. An authenticated database user could provide
  a specially crafted date/time value that, when processed, could cause
  PostgreSQL to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  permissions of the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0063)

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in various type input functions in PostgreSQL. An authenticated
  database user could possibly use these flaws to crash PostgreSQL or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
  running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0064)

  Multiple potential buffer overflow flaws were found in PostgreSQL.
  An authenticated database user could possibly use these flaws to crash
  PostgreSQL or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0065)

  It was found that granting an SQL role to a database user in a PostgreSQL
  database without specifying the "ADMIN" option allowed the grantee to
  remove other users from their granted role. An authenticated database user
  could use this flaw to remove a user from an SQL role which they were
  granted access to. (CVE-2014-0060)

  A flaw was found in the validator functions provided by PostgreSQL's
  procedural languages (PLs). An authenticated database user could possibly
  use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-0061)

  A race condition was found in the way the CREATE INDEX command performed
  multiple independent lookups of a table that had to be indexed. An
  authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2014-0062)

  It was found that the chkpass extension of PostgreSQL did not check the
  return value of the crypt() function. An authenticated database user could
  possibly use this flaw to crash PostgreSQL via a null pointer dereference.
  (CVE-2014-0066)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Noah Misch as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-0060 and CVE-2014-0063, Heikki Linnakangas and Noah Misch as the
  original reporters of CVE-2014-0064, Peter Eisentraut and Jozef Mlich as
  the original reporters of CVE-2014-0065, Andres Freund as the original
  reporter of CVE-2014-0061, Robert Haas and Andres Freund as the original
  reporters of CVE-2014-0062, and Honza Horak and Bruce Momjian as the
  original reporters of CVE-2014-0066.

  All PostgreSQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. If the postgresql
  service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing
  this update.
