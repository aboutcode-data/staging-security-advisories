  - CVE-2014-0157
summary: |
  Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
  interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
  The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
  size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
  to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

  A flaw was discovered in OpenStack Dashboard that could allow a remote
  attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if they were able to
  trick a horizon user into using a malicious heat template. Note that only
  setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in OpenStack Dashboard were
  affected. (CVE-2014-0157)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Cristian Fiorentino from Intel as the original
  reporter.

  All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue.
