summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
  Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security
  (DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography
  library.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the DTLS implementation of
  OpenSSL. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted DTLS message,
  which would cause an OpenSSL server to crash. (CVE-2014-3571)

  A memory leak flaw was found in the way the dtls1_buffer_record() function
  of OpenSSL parsed certain DTLS messages. A remote attacker could send
  multiple specially crafted DTLS messages to exhaust all available memory of
  a DTLS server. (CVE-2015-0206)

  It was found that OpenSSL's BigNumber Squaring implementation could produce
  incorrect results under certain special conditions. This flaw could
  possibly affect certain OpenSSL library functionality, such as RSA
  blinding. Note that this issue occurred rarely and with a low probability,
  and there is currently no known way of exploiting it. (CVE-2014-3570)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL would perform an ECDH key exchange with a
  non-ephemeral key even when the ephemeral ECDH cipher suite was selected.
  A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL use a weaker
  key exchange method than the one requested by the user. (CVE-2014-3572)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys when using
  non-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL
  client using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method. (CVE-2015-0204)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way OpenSSL parsed X.509 certificates.
  An attacker could use these flaws to modify an X.509 certificate to produce
  a certificate with a different fingerprint without invalidating its
  signature, and possibly bypass fingerprint-based blacklisting in
  applications. (CVE-2014-8275)

  It was found that an OpenSSL server would, under certain conditions, accept
  Diffie-Hellman client certificates without the use of a private key.
  An attacker could use a user's client certificate to authenticate as that
  user, without needing the private key. (CVE-2015-0205)

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to mitigate the above issues. For the update to
  take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and
  other SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
