summary: |
  This is the final notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support (EUS). This notification applies only to
  those customers subscribed to the Extended Update Support (EUS) channel for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Update Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 was retired on
  November 30, 2015, and support will no longer be provided. Accordingly, Red
  Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including Critical impact
  security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  6.5 EUS after November 30, 2015. In addition, technical support through Red
  Hat's Global Support Services will be limited as described under
  "non-current minor releases" in the Knowledge Base article located at
  https://access.redhat.com/articles/64664 after this date.

  We encourage customers to migrate from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 to a
  more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a benefit of the Red
  Hat subscription model, customers can use their active subscriptions to
  entitle any system on any currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  release.
