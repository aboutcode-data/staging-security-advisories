  - CVE-2014-3490
summary: |
  Updated Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.0 packages that
  fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6,
  and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-0818 was incomplete: external
  parameter entities were not disabled when the
  resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false.
  A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could
  use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2014-3490)

  This issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
