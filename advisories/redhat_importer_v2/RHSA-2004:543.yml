aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0888
  - CVE-2004-0923
summary: |
  Updated cups packages that fix denial of service issues, a security
  information leak, as well as other various bugs are now available.

  The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is a print spooler.

  During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered a number of integer
  overflow bugs that affect xpdf.  CUPS contains a copy of the xpdf code used
  for parsing PDF files and is therefore affected by these bugs.  An attacker
  who has the ability to send a malicious PDF file to a printer could cause
  CUPS to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-0888 to this issue.

  When set up to print to a shared printer via Samba, CUPS would authenticate
  with that shared printer using a username and password.  By default, the
  username and password used to connect to the Samba share is written
  into the error log file.  A local user who is able to read the error log
  file could collect these usernames and passwords.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-0923 to this issue.

  These updated packages also include a fix that prevents some CUPS
  configuration files from being accidentally replaced.

  All users of CUPS should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues.
