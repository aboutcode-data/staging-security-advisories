summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes several security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 Extras.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 18th November 2008]
  This erratum has been updated to include a reference to the additional
  CVE-named issue that was not public at the time of release. The security
  impact of the erratum has also been upgraded to Critical. No changes have
  been made to the packages.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Firefox-compatible Adobe Flash Player
  Web browser plug-in.

  A flaw was found in the way Adobe Flash Player wrote content to the
  clipboard. A malicious SWF (Shockwave Flash) file could populate the
  clipboard with a URL that could cause the user to accidentally or
  mistakenly load an attacker-controlled URL. (CVE-2008-3873)

  A flaw was found with Adobe's ActionScript scripting language which allowed
  Flash scripts to initiate file uploads and downloads without user
  interaction. ActionScript's FileReference.browse and FileReference.download
  method calls can now only be initiated via user interaction, such as
  through mouse-clicks or key-presses on the keyboard. (CVE-2008-4401)

  A flaw was found in Adobe Flash Player's display of Settings Manager
  content. A malicious SWF file could trick the user into unintentionally or
  mistakenly clicking a link or a dialog which could then give the malicious
  SWF file permission to access the local machine's camera or microphone.
  (CVE-2008-4503)

  Flaws were found in the way Flash Player restricted the interpretation and
  usage of cross-domain policy files. A remote attacker could use Flash
  Player to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting attacks
  (CVE-2007-4324, CVE-2007-6243). This update provides enhanced fixes for
  these issues.

  Flash Player contains a flaw in the way it interprets HTTP response
  headers. An attacker could use this flaw to conduct a cross-site scripting
  attack against the user running Flash Player. (CVE-2008-4818)

  A flaw was found in the way Flash Player handles the ActionScript
  attribute. A malicious site could use this flaw to inject arbitrary HTML
  content, confusing the user running the browser. (CVE-2008-4823)

  A flaw was found in the way Flash Player interprets policy files. It was
  possible to bypass a non-root domain policy, possibly allowing a malicious
  site to access data in a different domain. (CVE-2008-4822)

  A flaw was found in how Flash Player's jar: protocol handler interacts with
  Mozilla. A malicious flash application could use this flaw to disclose
  sensitive information. (CVE-2008-4821)

  Updated Flash Player also extends mechanisms to help prevent an attacker
  from executing a DNS rebinding attack. (CVE-2008-4819)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains Flash Player version 9.0.151.0.
