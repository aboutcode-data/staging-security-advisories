  - CVE-2015-3256
summary: |
  Updated polkit packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  PolicyKit is a toolkit for defining and handling authorizations.

  A denial of service flaw was found in how polkit handled authorization
  requests. A local, unprivileged user could send malicious requests to
  polkit, which could then cause the polkit daemon to corrupt its memory and
  crash. (CVE-2015-3256)

  All polkit users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. The system must be rebooted for
  this update to take effect.
