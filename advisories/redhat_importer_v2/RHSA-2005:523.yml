  - CVE-2005-1766
summary: |
  An updated RealPlayer package that fixes a buffer overflow issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 05 Jul 2005]
  The previous package for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 did not contain the
  proper fix for this issue.  This erratum has been updated with a replacement
  package that corrects this issue

  RealPlayer is a media player that provides media playback locally and
  via streaming. It plays RealAudio, RealVideo, MP3, 3GPP Video, Flash, SMIL
  2.0, JPEG, GIF, PNG, RealPix, RealText, and more.

  A buffer overflow bug was found in the way RealPlayer processes SMIL files.
  An attacker could create a specially crafted SMIL file that could combine
  with a malicious Web server to execute arbitrary code when the file was
  opened by a user. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1766 to this issue.

  All users of RealPlayer are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains RealPlayer version 10.0.5 and is not vulnerable to this issue.
