summary: |
  This is the 6-Month notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 3 Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS).

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 will be
  retired on January 30, 2014, and support will no longer be provided.
  Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including
  critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3 ELS after that date. In addition, after January 30,
  2014, technical support through Red Hat's Global Support Services will no
  longer be provided.

  Note: This notification applies only to those customers subscribed to the
  Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) channel for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 3 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6. As
  a benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 release or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 release.
