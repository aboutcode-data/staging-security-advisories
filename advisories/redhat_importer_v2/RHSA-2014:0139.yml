summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Pidgin processed
  certain HTTP responses. A malicious server could send a specially crafted
  HTTP response, causing Pidgin to crash or potentially execute arbitrary
  code with the permissions of the user running Pidgin. (CVE-2013-6485)

  Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in several protocol
  plug-ins in Pidgin (Gadu-Gadu, MXit, SIMPLE). A malicious server could send
  a specially crafted message, causing Pidgin to crash or potentially execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running Pidgin.
  (CVE-2013-6487, CVE-2013-6489, CVE-2013-6490)

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in several protocol plug-ins in
  Pidgin (Yahoo!, XMPP, MSN, stun, IRC). A remote attacker could use these
  flaws to crash Pidgin by sending a specially crafted message.
  (CVE-2012-6152, CVE-2013-6477, CVE-2013-6481, CVE-2013-6482, CVE-2013-6484,
  CVE-2014-0020)

  It was found that the Pidgin XMPP protocol plug-in did not verify the
  origin of "iq" replies. A remote attacker could use this flaw to spoof an
  "iq" reply, which could lead to injection of fake data or cause Pidgin to
  crash via a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2013-6483)

  A flaw was found in the way Pidgin parsed certain HTTP response headers.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin via a specially
  crafted HTTP response header. (CVE-2013-6479)

  It was found that Pidgin crashed when a mouse pointer was hovered over a
  long URL. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin by sending
  a message containing a long URL string. (CVE-2013-6478)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Thijs Alkemade, Robert Vehse, Jaime Breva Ribes,
  Jacob Appelbaum of the Tor Project, Daniel Atallah, Fabian Yamaguchi and
  Christian Wressnegger of the University of Goettingen, Matt Jones of
  Volvent, and Yves Younan, Ryan Pentney, and Pawel Janic of Sourcefire VRT
  as the original reporters of these issues.

  All pidgin users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. Pidgin must be
  restarted for this update to take effect.
