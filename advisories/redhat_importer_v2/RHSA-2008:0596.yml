summary: "An updated redhat-ds package that fixes various security issues is now\navailable\
  \ as Red Hat Directory Server 7.1, Service Pack 7.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nRed Hat Directory Server\
  \ is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server.\n\nMultiple CGI applications distributed with Red\
  \ Hat Directory Server were\naffected by a buffer overflow flaw in the routine used to parse\n\
  Accept-Language HTTP headers. A remote attacker with access to the\nAdministration Server\
  \ web interface could use this flaw to crash these CGI\napplications or, potentially, execute\
  \ arbitrary code with the privileges of\nthe Administration Server. Note: Red Hat Directory\
  \ Server 7.1 runs the\nAdministration Server as the root user. (CVE-2008-2928)\n\nMultiple\
  \ cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in the Directory Server\nAdministration Express\
  \ and Directory Server Gateway (DSGW) web interface,\ncaused by an incorrect parsing of \"\
  %\" character-escaped user-provided\nvalues. A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct\
  \ cross-site\nscripting attacks against Directory Server users or administrators using\nthese\
  \ web services. (CVE-2008-2929)\n\nMultiple memory leaks were identified in the Directory\
  \ Server. An\nunauthenticated remote attacker could use these flaws to trigger high\nmemory\
  \ consumption in the Directory Server, possibly causing it to crash or\nterminate unexpectedly\
  \ when running out of available memory. (CVE-2008-3283)\n\n[Updated 5th October 2008]\nUlf\
  \ Weltman of Hewlett Packard discovered a flaw in the way Directory\nServer handled LDAP search\
  \ requests with patterns. A remote attacker with\naccess to the LDAP service could create\
  \ a search request that, when the\nsearch pattern was matched against specially crafted data\
  \ records, caused\nDirectory Server to use a large amount of CPU time because the Directory\n\
  Server did not impose time limits on such search requests. In this updated\npackage, Directory\
  \ Server imposes the nsslapd-timelimit attribute on the\npattern-search query run times. This\
  \ attribute has the default limit of\n3600 seconds; to shorten this limit, use ldapmodify\
  \ to change the\nnsslapd-timelimit value in the cn=config entry. (CVE-2008-2930)\n\n\nIn addition\
  \ to these security fixes, the following bugs have been fixed in\nRed Hat Directory Server\
  \ 7.1, Service Pack 7:\n\n* A modified accountUnlockTime attribute caused by multiple single-user\n\
  login failures caused replication to fail, requiring administrator\nintervention. Red Hat\
  \ Directory Server 7.1 Service Pack 7 solves the\nreplication failure issue in these situations.\n\
  \n* The change sequence numbers in multi-master replication had a built-in\ntime skew to accommodate\
  \ differences in the clocks on master servers. Under\ncertain circumstances, this skew exceeded\
  \ the maximum allowable skew,\ncausing replication to stop entirely. In Service Pack 7, this\
  \ has been fixed.\n\n* In replication scenarios, if an attribute value was scheduled to be\n\
  deleted and also was indexed or had an attribute subtype which was indexed,\nthe Directory\
  \ Server would crash during the index operation.\n\n* The stack memory size limit used on\
  \ 64-bit systems was limited to 256KB.\nDirectory Server could use all the stack memory while\
  \ performing regular\noperations, resulting in slapd daemon crash. \n\nFor more information\
  \ about Service Pack 7, including upgrade and\ninstallation instructions for users running\
  \ Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 on\nSolaris, refer to the Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 SP7\
  \ release notes, which\nare linked to in the \"References\" section of this erratum.\n\nAll\
  \ users of Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 should upgrade to Service Pack 7,\nwhich resolves\
  \ these issues."
