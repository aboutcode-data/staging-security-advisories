  - CVE-2003-0855
summary: |
  Updated Pan packages that close a denial of service vulnerability are now
  available.

  Pan is a Gnome/GTK+ newsreader.

  A bug in Pan versions prior to 0.13.4 can cause Pan to crash when parsing
  an article header containing a very long author email address.  This bug
  causes a denial of service (crash), but cannot be exploited further.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2003-0855 to this issue.

  Users of Pan are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
  contain a backported patch correcting this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank Kasper Dupont for alerting us to this issue and
  to Charles Kerr for providing the patch.
