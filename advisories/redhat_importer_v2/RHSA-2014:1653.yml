summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that contain a backported patch to mitigate the
  CVE-2014-3566 issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
  Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security
  (DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography
  library.

  This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
  (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
  attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
  protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
  supported protocol version fails.

  This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
  The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
  attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
  This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
  POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
  update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
  require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

  For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
  at https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to mitigate the CVE-2014-3566 issue. For the
  update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as
  httpd and other SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system
  rebooted.
