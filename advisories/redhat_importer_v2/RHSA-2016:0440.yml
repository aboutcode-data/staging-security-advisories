  - CVE-2015-5295
summary: "Updated OpenStack Orchestration packages that fix one security issue and\ntwo bugs\
  \ are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack\nPlatform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL\
  \ 6.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security\nimpact.\
  \ Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings,\
  \ are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\n\
  OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify\nand deploy configurations\
  \ for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking.\nIt can also be used to automate post-deployment\
  \ actions, which in turn\nallows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and\n\
  applications. Orchestration can also be integrated with Telemetry alarms to\nimplement auto-scaling\
  \ for certain infrastructure resources.\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the OpenStack\
  \ Orchestration \nservice (heat), where a specially formatted template could be used to\n\
  trick the heat-engine service into opening a local file. Although the\nfile contents are never\
  \ disclosed to the end user, an OpenStack-\nauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to\
  \ cause a denial of service\nor determine whether a given file name is present on the server.\n\
  (CVE-2015-5295)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Steven Hardy of Red Hat."
