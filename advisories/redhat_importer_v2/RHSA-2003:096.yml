summary: "Updated Samba packages are now available to fix security vulnerabilities\nfound during\
  \ a code audit.\n\nSamba is a suite of utilities which provides file and printer sharing\n\
  services to SMB/CIFS clients.\n\nSebastian Krahmer discovered a security vulnerability present\n\
  in unpatched versions of Samba prior to 2.2.8. An anonymous user could use\nthe vulnerability\
  \ to gain root access on the target machine. \n\nAdditionally, a race condition could allow\
  \ an attacker to overwrite\ncritical system files.\n\nAll users of Samba are advised to update\
  \ to the erratum packages which\ncontain patches to correct these vulnerabilities.\n\nThese\
  \ packages contain the security fixes backported to the Samba 2.2.7\ncodebase."
