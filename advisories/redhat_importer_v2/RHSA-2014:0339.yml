summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues is
  now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that
  could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to
  incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this
  flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by
  GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker. (CVE-2014-0092)

  A flaw was found in the way the get_rx_bufs() function in the vhost_net
  implementation in the Linux kernel handled error conditions reported by the
  vhost_get_vq_desc() function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
  to crash the host. (CVE-2014-0055)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's cdc-wdm
  driver, used for USB CDC WCM device management. An attacker with physical
  access to a system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1860)

  The CVE-2014-0092 issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the
  Red Hat Security Technologies Team.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2014-0101, and CVE-2014-0069 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2010-2596, CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-1961, CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4232,
  CVE-2013-4243, and CVE-2013-4244 (libtiff issues)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
