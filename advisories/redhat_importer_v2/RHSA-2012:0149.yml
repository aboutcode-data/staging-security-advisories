  - CVE-2011-4347
summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  It was found that the kvm_vm_ioctl_assign_device() function in the KVM
  subsystem of a Linux kernel did not check if the user requesting device
  assignment was privileged or not. A member of the kvm group on the host
  could assign unused PCI devices, or even devices that were in use and
  whose resources were not properly claimed by the respective drivers, which
  could result in the host crashing. (CVE-2011-4347)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sasha Levin for reporting this issue.

  These updated kvm packages include several bug fixes. Space precludes
  documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to
  the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.8 Technical Notes, linked to in the
  References, for information on the most significant of these changes.

  All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in the
  Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.
