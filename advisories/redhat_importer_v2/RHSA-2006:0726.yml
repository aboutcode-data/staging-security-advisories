summary: |
  New Wireshark packages that fix various security vulnerabilities are now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic.

  Several flaws were found in Wireshark's HTTP, WBXML, LDAP, and XOT protocol
  dissectors. Wireshark could crash or stop responding if it read a malformed
  packet off the network. (CVE-2006-4805, CVE-2006-5468, CVE-2006-5469,
  CVE-2006-5740)

  A single NULL byte heap based buffer overflow was found in Wireshark's MIME
  Multipart dissector. Wireshark could crash or possibly execute arbitrary
  arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2006-4574)

  Users of Wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages containing
  Wireshark version 0.99.4, which is not vulnerable to these issues.
