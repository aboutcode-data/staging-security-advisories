summary: |
  Updated fuse packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) can implement a fully functional file system
  in a user-space program. These packages provide the mount utility,
  fusermount, the tool used to mount FUSE file systems.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way fusermount handled the mounting and
  unmounting of directories when symbolic links were present. A local user in
  the fuse group could use these flaws to unmount file systems, which they
  would otherwise not be able to unmount and that were not mounted using
  FUSE, via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2010-3879, CVE-2011-0541,
  CVE-2011-0542, CVE-2011-0543)

  Note: The util-linux-ng RHBA-2011:0699 update must also be installed to
  fully correct the above flaws.

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
