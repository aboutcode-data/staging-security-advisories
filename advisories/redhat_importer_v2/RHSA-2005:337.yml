aliases:
  - CVE-2005-0255
  - CVE-2005-0399
summary: |
  Updated thunderbird packages that fix various bugs are now available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A buffer overflow bug was found in the way Thunderbird processes GIF
  images. It is possible for an attacker to create a specially crafted GIF
  image, which when viewed by a victim will execute arbitrary code as the
  victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2005-0399 to this issue.

  A bug was found in the Thunderbird string handling functions. If a
  malicious website is able to exhaust a system's memory, it becomes possible
  to execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0255 to this issue.

  Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this updated package which
  contains Thunderbird version 1.0.2 and is not vulnerable to these issues.
