summary: "An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each\
  \ vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nRed Hat JBoss Core Services\
  \ is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software,\
  \ such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged\
  \ under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a\
  \ more consistent update experience.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache\
  \ HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 3 serves as a replacement of Red Hat JBoss Core Services\
  \ Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes (including fixes from previous Service\
  \ Pack 1 and 2), which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\
  \ \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An out-of-bounds array dereference was found in apr_time_exp_get().\
  \ An attacker could abuse an unvalidated usage of this function to cause a denial of service\
  \ or potentially lead to data leak. (CVE-2017-12613)\n\n* It was discovered that the use of\
  \ httpd's ap_get_basic_auth_pw() API function outside of the authentication phase could lead\
  \ to authentication bypass. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass required\
  \ authentication if the API was used incorrectly by one of the modules used by httpd. (CVE-2017-3167)\n\
  \n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd's mod_ssl module. A remote attacker\
  \ could use this flaw to cause an httpd child process to crash if another module used by httpd\
  \ called a certain API function during the processing of an HTTPS request. (CVE-2017-3169)\n\
  \n* A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd's mod_mime module. A user permitted to\
  \ modify httpd's MIME configuration could use this flaw to cause httpd child process to crash.\
  \ (CVE-2017-7679)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way httpd handled invalid and\
  \ previously unregistered HTTP methods specified in the Limit directive used in an .htaccess\
  \ file. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the server\
  \ memory, or cause httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2017-9798)\n\nRed Hat would like to\
  \ thank Hanno Böck for reporting CVE-2017-9798."
