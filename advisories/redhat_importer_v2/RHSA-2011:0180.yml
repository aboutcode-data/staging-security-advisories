  - CVE-2011-0020
summary: |
  Updated pango and evolution28-pango packages that fix one security issue
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Pango is a library used for the layout and rendering of internationalized
  text.

  An input sanitization flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way Pango displayed font files when using the FreeType font
  engine back end. If a user loaded a malformed font file with an application
  that uses Pango, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2011-0020)

  Users of pango and evolution28-pango are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
  After installing the updated packages, you must restart your system or
  restart your X session for the update to take effect.
