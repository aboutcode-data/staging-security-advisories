summary: |
  Updated gnutls packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). GnuTLS includes libtasn1,
  a library developed for ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures
  management that includes DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding and
  decoding.

  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS decrypted malformed TLS records. This
  could cause a TLS/SSL client or server to crash when processing a
  specially-crafted TLS record from a remote TLS/SSL connection peer.
  (CVE-2012-1573)

  A flaw was found in the way libtasn1 decoded DER data. An attacker could
  create a carefully-crafted X.509 certificate that, when parsed by an
  application that uses GnuTLS, could cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2012-1569)

  A boundary error was found in the gnutls_session_get_data() function. A
  malicious TLS/SSL server could use this flaw to crash a TLS/SSL client or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code as the client, if the client passed a
  fixed-sized buffer to gnutls_session_get_data() before checking the real
  size of the session data provided by the server. (CVE-2011-4128)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Hall of Mu Dynamics for reporting
  CVE-2012-1573 and CVE-2012-1569.

  Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all applications linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted, or
  the system rebooted.
