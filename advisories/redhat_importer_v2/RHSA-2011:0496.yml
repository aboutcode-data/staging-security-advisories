aliases:
  - CVE-2011-1583
  - CVE-2011-3262
summary: |
  Updated xen packages that fix several security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
  managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  It was found that the xc_try_bzip2_decode() and xc_try_lzma_decode() decode
  routines did not correctly check for a possible buffer size overflow in the
  decoding loop. As well, several integer overflow flaws and missing
  error/range checking were found that could lead to an infinite loop. A
  privileged guest user could use these flaws to crash the guest or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code in the privileged management domain
  (Dom0). (CVE-2011-1583)

  All xen users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
