summary: "Updated kernel packages are now available fixing several security\nvulnerabilities.\n\
  \n[Updated 28 August 2003]\nAdded CAN-2003-0699 and CAN-2003-0700 to the list of security\
  \ issues that\nare fixed by this advisory (there are no changes to the packages themselves).\n\
  \nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nSeveral security\
  \ issues have been discovered affecting the Linux kernel:\n\nCAN-2003-0461: /proc/tty/driver/serial\
  \ reveals the exact character counts\nfor serial links.  This could be used by a local attacker\
  \ to infer password\nlengths and inter-keystroke timings during password entry.\n\nCAN-2003-0462:\
  \ Paul Starzetz discovered a file read race condition existing\nin the execve() system call,\
  \ which could cause a local crash.\n\nCAN-2003-0464: A recent change in the RPC code set the\
  \ reuse flag on\nnewly-created sockets.  Olaf Kirch noticed that his could allow normal\n\
  users to bind to UDP ports used for services such as nfsd.\n\nCAN-2003-0476: The execve system\
  \ call in Linux 2.4.x records the file\ndescriptor of the executable process in the file table\
  \ of the calling\nprocess, allowing local users to gain read access to restricted file\ndescriptors.\
  \  \n\nCAN-2003-0501: The /proc filesystem in Linux allows local users to obtain\nsensitive\
  \ information by opening various entries in /proc/self before\nexecuting a setuid program.\
  \  This causes the program to fail to change the\nownership and permissions of already opened\
  \ entries.\n \nCAN-2003-0550: The STP protocol is known to have no security, which could\n\
  allow attackers to alter the bridge topology.  STP is now turned off by\ndefault.\n\nCAN-2003-0551:\
  \ STP input processing was lax in its length checking, which\ncould lead to a denial of service.\n\
  \nCAN-2003-0552: Jerry Kreuscher discovered that the Forwarding table could\nbe spoofed by\
  \ sending forged packets with bogus source addresses the same\nas the local host.  \n\nCAN-2003-0699:\
  \ The C-Media PCI sound driver in kernel versions prior to\n2.4.21 does not use the get_user\
  \ function to access userspace, which\ncrosses security boundaries and may facilitate the\
  \ exploitation of\nvulnerabilities.\n\nCAN-2003-0700: The C-Media PCI sound driver in kernel\
  \ versions prior to\n2.4.22 accesses userspace without using the get_user function, which\
  \ is a\npotential security hole (NOTE: this issue is distinct from that described\nin CAN-2003-0699).\n\
  \nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain\nbackported security\
  \ patches correcting these vulnerabilities.\n \n\nImportant:\n\nIf you use Red Hat Linux 7.1,\
  \ you must have installed quota-3.06-9.71 from\nRHSA-2003-187, and if you use Red Hat Linux\
  \ 7.2 or 7.3, you must have\ninstalled quota-3.06-9.7 from RHSA-2003-187."
