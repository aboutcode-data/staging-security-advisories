summary: |
  Updated gimp packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
  editing program.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in the GIMP's Adobe Photoshop (PSD) image file plug-in. An
  attacker could create a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened,
  could cause the PSD plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-3909,
  CVE-2012-3402)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF
  plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
  decompression algorithm implementation used by the GIMP's GIF image format
  plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted GIF image file that,
  when opened, could cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP.
  (CVE-2011-2896)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file
  format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette
  file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)

  Red Hat would like to thank Secunia Research for reporting CVE-2009-3909,
  and Matthias Weckbecker of the SUSE Security Team for reporting
  CVE-2012-3481.

  Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
