  - CVE-2002-0659
summary: "Updated OpenSSL packages are available for Red Hat Linux Advanced Server.\nThese updates\
  \ fix multiple protocol parsing bugs, which may cause a denial\nof service (DoS) attack or\
  \ cause SSL-enabled applications to crash.\n\n[Updated 06 Jan 2003]\nAdded fixed packages\
  \ for the ia64 architecture.\n\n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for Advanced Workstation\
  \ 2.1\n\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and open source toolkit\nwhich implements\
  \ the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols as\
  \ well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library.\n\nPortions of the SSL protocol\
  \ data stream, which include the lengths of\nstructures which are being transferred, may not\
  \ be properly validated.\nThis may allow a malicious server or client to cause an affected\
  \ \napplication to crash or enter an infinite loop, which can be used as a\ndenial of service\
  \ (DoS) attack if the application is a server.  It has not \nbeen verified if this issue could\
  \ lead to further consequences such as \nremote code execution.\n\nThese errata packages contain\
  \ a patch to correct this vulnerability. \nPlease note that the original patch from the OpenSSL\
  \ team had a mistake in\nit which could possibly still allow buffer overflows to occur.  This\
  \ bug \nis also fixed in these errata packages.\n\nNOTE:\n\nPlease read the Solution section\
  \ below as it contains instructions for\nmaking sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted\
  \ after the update\nis applied.\n\nThanks go to the OpenSSL team for providing patches for\
  \ these issues."
