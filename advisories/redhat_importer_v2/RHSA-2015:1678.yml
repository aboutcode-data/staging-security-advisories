summary: "Updated python-django packages that fix a security issue are now\navailable for Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update\
  \ as having Moderate \nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\
  \ \nscore, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the \nCVE link in the\
  \ References section.\n\nDjango is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid\n\
  development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as \nmuch as possible\
  \ and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) \nprinciple.\n\nA flaw was found in the\
  \ Django session backends whereby an \nunauthenticated attacker could cause session records\
  \ to be created in \nthe configured session store, leading to a Denial of Service. \n(CVE-2015-5143)\n\
  \nRed Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this issue.\n\nAll\
  \ python-django users are advised to upgrade to these updated \npackages, which contain a\
  \ backported patch to correct these issues."
