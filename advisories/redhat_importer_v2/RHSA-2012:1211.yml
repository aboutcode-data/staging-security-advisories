summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1970,
  CVE-2012-1972, CVE-2012-1973, CVE-2012-1974, CVE-2012-1975, CVE-2012-1976,
  CVE-2012-3956, CVE-2012-3957, CVE-2012-3958, CVE-2012-3959, CVE-2012-3960,
  CVE-2012-3961, CVE-2012-3962, CVE-2012-3963, CVE-2012-3964)

  Content containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file
  could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3969,
  CVE-2012-3970)

  Two flaws were found in the way Thunderbird rendered certain images using
  WebGL. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain
  conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3967, CVE-2012-3968)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded embedded bitmap images in
  Icon Format (ICO) files. Content containing a malicious ICO file could
  cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2012-3966)

  A flaw was found in the way the "eval" command was handled by the
  Thunderbird Error Console. Running "eval" in the Error Console while
  viewing malicious content could possibly cause Thunderbird to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2012-3980)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way Thunderbird used the
  format-number feature of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations). Malicious content could possibly cause an information
  leak, or cause Thunderbird to crash. (CVE-2012-3972)

  A flaw was found in the location object implementation in Thunderbird.
  Malicious content could use this flaw to possibly allow restricted content
  to be loaded. (CVE-2012-3978)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, John
  Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic, Daniel Holbert, Abhishek Arya, Frédéric
  Hoguin, miaubiz, Arthur Gerkis, Nicolas Grégoire, moz_bug_r_a4, and Colby
  Russell as the original reporters of these issues.

  Note: All issues except CVE-2012-3969 and CVE-2012-3970 cannot be exploited
  by a specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by
  default for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in
  Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS
  feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 10.0.7 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
  installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
  take effect.
