  - CVE-2010-3614
summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  It was discovered that named did not invalidate previously cached RRSIG
  records when adding an NCACHE record for the same entry to the cache. A
  remote attacker allowed to send recursive DNS queries to named could use
  this flaw to crash named. (CVE-2010-3613)

  It was discovered that, in certain cases, named did not properly perform
  DNSSEC validation of an NS RRset for zones in the middle of a DNSKEY
  algorithm rollover. This flaw could cause the validator to incorrectly
  determine that the zone is insecure and not protected by DNSSEC.
  (CVE-2010-3614)

  All BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve these issues. After installing the
  update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.
