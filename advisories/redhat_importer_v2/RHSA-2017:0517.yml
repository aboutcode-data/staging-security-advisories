  [Updated May 2, 2017]
  CVE-2016-8657 was originally listed as resolved with this erratum. However, this was incorrect, as that issue only affected RPM installations and not zip files as provided by this erratum.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that a programming error in the processing of HTTPS requests in the Apache Tomcat servlet and JSP engine may result in denial of service via an infinite loop. (CVE-2017-6056)

  * It was found that GZIPInterceptor is enabled when not necessarily required in RESTEasy. An attacker could use this flaw to launch a Denial of Service attack. (CVE-2016-6346)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mikhail Egorov (Odin) for reporting the CVE-2016-6346 issue.
