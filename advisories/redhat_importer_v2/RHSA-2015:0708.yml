summary: |
  Updated qpid packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG is a next-generation IT infrastructure incorporating
  Messaging, Real Time, and Grid functionality. It offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
  based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
  standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
  messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
  messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
  vendors.

  MRG Messaging includes AMQP messaging broker; AMQP client libraries for
  C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence libraries and
  management tools.

  It was discovered that the Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not restrict access to
  anonymous users when the ANONYMOUS mechanism was disallowed.
  (CVE-2015-0223)

  A flaw was found in the way the Qpid daemon (qpidd) processed certain
  protocol sequences. An unauthenticated attacker able to send a specially
  crafted protocol sequence set that could use this flaw to crash qpidd.
  (CVE-2015-0203, CVE-2015-0224)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for reporting
  the CVE-2015-0203 issue. Upstream acknowledges G. Geshev from MWR Labs as
  the original reporter.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the neutron messaging client rewrote (by method of
  "monkey-patching") the python selector module to support eventlet
  threading. The rewritten client did not update select.poll() during this
  process, which is used by qpid-python to manage I/O. This resulted in
  poll() deadlocks and neutron server hangs. The fix introduces updates to
  the python-qpid library that avoid calling poll() if eventlet threading is
  detected. Instead, the eventlet-aware select() is called, which prevents
  deadlocks from occurring and corrects the originally reported issue.
  (BZ#1175872)

  * It was discovered that the QPID Broker aborted with an uncaught
  UnknownExchangeTypeException when the client attempted to request an
  unsupported exchange type. The code for the Exchange Registry and Node
  Policy has been improved to prevent this issue from happening again.
  (BZ#1186694)

  Users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 3, which is
  layered on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct these issues.
