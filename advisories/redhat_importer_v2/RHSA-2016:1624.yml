summary: |
  Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.3 Service Pack 1 and fixes two security issues and a bug with ajp processors are now available for Solaris, and Microsoft Windows from the Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.3 Service Pack 1 serves as a update for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0.3 httpd and tomcat.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5387)

  * It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388)

  Note: After this update, httpd will no longer pass the value of the Proxy request header to scripts via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

  Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.
