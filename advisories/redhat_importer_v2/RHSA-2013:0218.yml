  - CVE-2013-0241
summary: |
  An updated xorg-x11-drv-qxl package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The xorg-x11-drv-qxl package provides an X11 video driver for the QEMU QXL
  video accelerator. This driver makes it possible to use Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 as a guest operating system under the KVM kernel module and the
  QEMU multi-platform emulator, using the SPICE protocol.

  A flaw was found in the way the host's qemu-kvm qxl driver and the guest's
  X.Org qxl driver interacted when a SPICE connection terminated. A user able
  to initiate a SPICE connection to a guest could use this flaw to make the
  guest temporarily unavailable or, potentially (if the sysctl
  kernel.softlockup_panic variable was set to "1" in the guest), crash the
  guest. (CVE-2013-0241)

  All users of xorg-x11-drv-qxl are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue. All
  running X.Org server instances using the qxl driver must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
