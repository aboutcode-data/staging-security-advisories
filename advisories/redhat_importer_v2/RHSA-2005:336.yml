summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix various bugs are now available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

  A buffer overflow bug was found in the way Firefox processes GIF images. It
  is possible for an attacker to create a specially crafted GIF image, which
  when viewed by a victim will execute arbitrary code as the victim. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2005-0399 to this issue.

  A bug was found in the way Firefox processes XUL content. If a malicious
  web page can trick a user into dragging an object, it is possible to load
  malicious XUL content. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0401 to this issue.

  A bug was found in the way Firefox bookmarks content to the sidebar. If a
  user can be tricked into bookmarking a malicious web page into the sidebar
  panel, that page could execute arbitrary programs. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2005-0402 to this issue.

  Users of Firefox are advised to upgrade to this updated package which
  contains Firefox version 1.0.2 and is not vulnerable to these issues.
