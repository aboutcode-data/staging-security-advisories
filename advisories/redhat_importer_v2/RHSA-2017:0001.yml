aliases:
  - CVE-2016-7030
  - CVE-2016-9575
summary: |
  An update for ipa is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat Identity Management (IdM) is a centralized authentication, identity management, and authorization solution for both traditional and cloud-based enterprise environments.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the default IdM password policies that lock out accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts were also applied to host and service accounts. A remote unauthenticated user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service attack against kerberized services. (CVE-2016-7030)

  * It was found that IdM's certprofile-mod command did not properly check the user's permissions while modifying certificate profiles. An authenticated, unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to modify profiles to issue certificates with arbitrary naming or key usage information and subsequently use such certificates for other attacks. (CVE-2016-9575)

  The CVE-2016-7030 issue was discovered by Petr Spacek (Red Hat) and the CVE-2016-9575 issue was discovered by Liam Campbell (Red Hat).
