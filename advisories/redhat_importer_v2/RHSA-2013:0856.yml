summary: |
  An updated pki-tps package that fixes two security issues is now available
  for Red Hat Certificate System 8.1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) is an enterprise software system designed
  to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments. The Token
  Processing System (TPS) is a PKI subsystem that acts as a Registration
  Authority (RA) for authenticating and processing enrollment requests, PIN
  reset requests, and formatting requests from the Enterprise Security
  Client.

  A format string flaw was found in the TPS subsystem. An authenticated
  Certificate System user could use this flaw to crash the Apache HTTP Server
  child process, possibly interrupting the processing of other users'
  requests, or possibly execute arbitrary code with pkiuser privileges.
  (CVE-2013-1886)

  A cross-site scripting flaw was discovered in the TPS subsystem. An
  attacker could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against victims using Certificate System's web interface. (CVE-2013-1885)

  All users of Red Hat Certificate System are advised to upgrade to this
  updated package, which corrects these issues. After installing this update,
  all Red Hat Certificate System subsystems must be restarted ("/etc/init.d
  /[instance-name] restart") for the update to take effect.
