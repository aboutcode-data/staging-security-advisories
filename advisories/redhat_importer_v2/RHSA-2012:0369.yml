aliases:
  - CVE-2012-0805
summary: |
  An updated python-sqlalchemy package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides a flexible,
  high-level interface to SQL databases.

  It was discovered that SQLAlchemy did not sanitize values for the limit and
  offset keywords for SQL select statements. If an application using
  SQLAlchemy accepted values for these keywords, and did not filter or
  sanitize them before passing them to SQLAlchemy, it could allow an attacker
  to perform an SQL injection attack against the application. (CVE-2012-0805)

  All users of python-sqlalchemy are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which contains a patch to correct this issue. All running
  applications using SQLAlchemy must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
