summary: |
  Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes multiple security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Fuse ESB Enterprise, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides an integration
  platform.

  This release of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1 is an update to
  Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 and includes bug fixes. Refer to the readme file
  included with the patch files for information about the bug fixes.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
  frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
  insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
  on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
  CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
  recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)

  Note: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when
  WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements. It is best
  practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce security requirements.

  A flaw in JRuby's JSON gem allowed remote attacks by creating different
  types of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of
  service attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
  create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It could
  also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
  injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

  It was discovered that JRuby's REXML library did not properly restrict XML
  entity expansion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service by tricking a Ruby application using REXML to read text nodes from
  specially-crafted XML content, which will result in REXML consuming large
  amounts of system memory. (CVE-2013-1821)

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the Apache CXF
  StAX parser implementation processed certain XML files. If a web service
  utilized the StAX parser, a remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to excessive
  CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2013-2160)

  Note: Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 ships JRuby as part of the camel-ruby
  component, which allows users to define Camel routes in Ruby. The default
  use of JRuby in Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 does not appear to expose either
  CVE-2013-0269 or CVE-2013-1821. If the version of JRuby shipped with Fuse
  ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 was used to build a custom application, then these
  flaws could be exposed.

  Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
  Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575; Ruby
  on Rails upstream for reporting CVE-2013-0269; and Andreas Falkenberg of
  SEC Consult Deutschland GmbH, and Christian Mainka, Juraj Somorovsky and
  Joerg Schwenk of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2013-2160.
  Upstream acknowledges Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag and Ben Murphy as the
  original reporters of CVE-2013-0269.

  All users of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up
  patch 1.
