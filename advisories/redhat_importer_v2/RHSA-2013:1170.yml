summary: |
  Updated mongodb and pymongo packages that fix two security issues and add
  one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  MongoDB is a NoSQL database. PyMongo provides tools for working with
  MongoDB.

  A flaw was found in the run() function implementation in MongoDB. A
  database user permitted to send database queries to a MongoDB server could
  use this flaw to crash the server or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the mongodb user. (CVE-2013-1892)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in PyMongo. An invalid DBRef
  record received from a MongoDB server could cause an application using
  PyMongo to crash. (CVE-2013-2132)

  Note: In Red Hat Enterprise MRG Grid, MongoDB is not accessed by users
  directly and is only accessed by other Grid services, such as Condor and
  Cumin.

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * Previously, MongoDB was configured to listen for connections on all
  network interfaces. This could allow remote users to access the database if
  the firewall was configured to allow access to the MongoDB port (access is
  blocked by the default firewall configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
  This update changes the configuration to only listen on the loopback
  interface by default. (BZ#892767)

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to resolve these issues and add this enhancement. After installing
  this update, MongoDB will be restarted automatically.
