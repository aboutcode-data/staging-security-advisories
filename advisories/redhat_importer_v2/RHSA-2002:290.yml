summary: |
  Updated Ethereal packages are available which fix various security issues.

  Ethereal is a package designed for monitoring network traffic on your
  system.  Several security issues have been found in the Ethereal packages
  distributed with Red Hat Linux versions 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0

  Multiple integer signedness errors in the BGP dissector in Ethereal
  0.9.7 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (infinite loop) via malformed messages.  This problem was discovered by
  Silvio Cesare.  CAN-2002-1355

  Ethereal 0.9.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed
  packets to the LMP, PPP, or TDS dissectors.  CAN-2002-1356

  Users of Ethereal should update to the erratum packages containing Ethereal
  version 0.9.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.
