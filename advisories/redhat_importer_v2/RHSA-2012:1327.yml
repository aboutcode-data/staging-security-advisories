  - CVE-2012-3547
summary: |
  Updated freeradius2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free Remote
  Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server, designed to allow
  centralized authentication and authorization for a network.

  A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the way radiusd handled the
  expiration date field in X.509 client certificates. A remote attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to crash radiusd if it were configured to use the
  certificate or TLS tunnelled authentication methods (such as EAP-TLS,
  EAP-TTLS, and PEAP). (CVE-2012-3547)

  Red Hat would like to thank Timo Warns of PRESENSE Technologies GmbH for
  reporting this issue.

  Users of FreeRADIUS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  update, radiusd will be restarted automatically.
