summary: |
  Red Hat Application Stack v2.4 is now available. This update fixes several
  security issues and adds various enhancements.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Application Stack v2.4 is an integrated open source application
  stack, that includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform (EAP). JBoss EAP is provided through the JBoss EAP
  channels on the Red Hat Network.

  PostgreSQL was updated to version 8.2.14, fixing the following security
  issues:

  A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handles LDAP-based authentication.
  If PostgreSQL was configured to use LDAP authentication and the LDAP server
  was configured to allow anonymous binds, anyone able to connect to a given
  database could use this flaw to log in as any database user, including a
  PostgreSQL superuser, without supplying a password. (CVE-2009-3231)

  It was discovered that the upstream patch for CVE-2007-6600 included in the
  Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2008:0040 did not include protection against
  misuse of the RESET ROLE and RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION commands. An
  authenticated user could use this flaw to install malicious code that would
  later execute with superuser privileges. (CVE-2009-3230)

  A flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handles external plug-ins. This flaw
  could allow remote, authenticated users without superuser privileges to
  crash the back-end server by using the LOAD command on libraries in
  "/var/lib/pgsql/plugins/" that have already been loaded, causing a
  temporary denial of service during crash recovery. (CVE-2009-3229)

  MySQL was updated to version 5.0.84, fixing the following security issues:

  An insufficient HTML entities quoting flaw was found in the mysql command
  line client's HTML output mode. If an attacker was able to inject arbitrary
  HTML tags into data stored in a MySQL database, which was later retrieved
  using the mysql command line client and its HTML output mode, they could
  perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing the
  HTML output in a web browser. (CVE-2008-4456)

  Multiple format string flaws were found in the way the MySQL server logs
  user commands when creating and deleting databases. A remote, authenticated
  attacker with permissions to CREATE and DROP databases could use these
  flaws to formulate a specifically-crafted SQL command that would cause a
  temporary denial of service (open connections to mysqld are terminated).
  (CVE-2009-2446)

  Note: To exploit the CVE-2009-2446 flaws, the general query log (the mysqld
  "--log" command line option or the "log" option in "/etc/my.cnf") must be
  enabled. This logging is not enabled by default.

  PHP was updated to version 5.2.10, fixing the following security issue:

  An insufficient input validation flaw was discovered in the PHP
  exif_read_data() function, used to read Exchangeable image file format
  (Exif) metadata from images. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
  image that could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or disclose portions of
  its memory while reading the Exif metadata from the image. (CVE-2009-2687)

  Apache httpd has been updated with backported patches to correct the
  following security issues:

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp
  module. A malicious FTP server to which requests are being proxied could
  use this flaw to crash an httpd child process via a malformed reply to the
  EPSV or PASV commands, resulting in a limited denial of service.
  (CVE-2009-3094)

  A second flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy_ftp module. In a reverse
  proxy configuration, a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass
  intended access restrictions by creating a carefully-crafted HTTP
  Authorization header, allowing the attacker to send arbitrary commands to
  the FTP server. (CVE-2009-3095)

  Also, the following packages have been updated:

  * postgresql-jdbc to 8.2.510
  * php-pear to 1.8.1
  * perl-DBI to 1.609
  * perl-DBD-MySQL to 4.012

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these
  issues. Users must restart the individual services, including postgresql,
  mysqld, and httpd, for this update to take effect.
