  - CVE-2017-15134
summary: |
  An update for 389-ds-base is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  389 Directory Server is an LDAP version 3 (LDAPv3) compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server administration.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the way 389-ds-base handled certain LDAP search filters. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to make ns-slapd crash via a specially crafted LDAP request, thus resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-15134)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, when a connection received a high operation rate, Directory Server stopped to poll the connection in certain situations. As a consequence, new requests on the connection were not detected and processed. With this update, Directory Server correctly decides whether a connection has to be polled. As a result, connections with a high request rate no longer remain unprocessed. (BZ#1523505)

  * Previously, if Directory Server was stopped during an operation which created additional changes in the memory changelog, the Replication Update Vector (RUV) in the changelog was higher than the RUV in the database. As a consequence, Directory Server recreated the changelog when the server started. With this update, the server now writes the highest RUV to the changelog only if there is the highest Change Sequence Number (CSN) present in it. As a result, the database and the changelog RUV are consistent and the server does not need recreating the changelog at start up. (BZ#1523507)

  * Due to a bug, using a large number of Class of Service (CoS) templates in Directory Server increased the virtual attribute processing time. This update improves the structure of the CoS storage. As a result, using a large number of CoS templates no longer increases the virtual attribute processing time. (BZ#1526928)
