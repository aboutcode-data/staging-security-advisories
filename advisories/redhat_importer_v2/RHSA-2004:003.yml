summary: "Updated cvs packages closing a vulnerability that could allow cvs to\nattempt to create\
  \ files and directories in the root file system are now\navailable.\n\nCVS is a version control\
  \ system frequently used to manage source code\nrepositories.  \n\nA flaw was found in versions\
  \ of CVS prior to 1.11.10 where a malformed\nmodule request could cause the CVS server to\
  \ attempt to create files or\ndirectories at the root level of the file system.  However,\
  \ normal file\nsystem permissions would prevent the creation of these misplaced\ndirectories.\
  \  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2003-0977 to this issue.\n\nUsers of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages,\
  \ which\ncontain a patch correcting this issue."
