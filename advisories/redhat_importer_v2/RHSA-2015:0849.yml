summary: |
  Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.4.0, and fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and add various
  enhancements, are now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for
  Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an
  exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the
  attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack.
  The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain
  text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

  A flaw was found in the way PicketLink's Service Provider and Identity
  Provider handled certain requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  log to a victim's account via PicketLink. (CVE-2015-0277)

  It was discovered that a JkUnmount rule for a subtree of a previous JkMount
  rule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker to potentially
  access a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be accessible
  to them. (CVE-2014-8111)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys when using
  non-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL
  client using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method. (CVE-2015-0204)

  It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the
  requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature
  wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the
  contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

  It was found that OpenSSL's BigNumber Squaring implementation could produce
  incorrect results under certain special conditions. This flaw could
  possibly affect certain OpenSSL library functionality, such as RSA
  blinding. Note that this issue occurred rarely and with a low probability,
  and there is currently no known way of exploiting it. (CVE-2014-3570)

  It was found that the Command Line Interface, as provided by Red Hat
  Enterprise Application Platform, created a history file named
  .jboss-cli-history in the user's home directory with insecure default file
  permissions. This could allow a malicious local user to gain information
  otherwise not accessible to them. (CVE-2014-3586)

  The CVE-2015-0277 issue was discovered by Ondrej Kotek of Red Hat.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform also includes bug
  fixes and enhancements. Documentation for these changes will be available
  shortly from the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.0 Release Notes,
  linked to in the References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
