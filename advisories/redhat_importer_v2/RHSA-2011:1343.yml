  - CVE-2011-2999
summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes two security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled frame objects with certain
  names. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a plug-in to grant its
  content access to another site or the local file system, violating the
  same-origin policy. (CVE-2011-2999)

  An integer underflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled large
  JavaScript regular expressions. An HTML mail message containing malicious
  JavaScript could cause Thunderbird to access already freed memory, causing
  Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-2998)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
