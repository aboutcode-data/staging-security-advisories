summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * Information leak flaws were found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control
  Unit implementation. A local attacker could use these flaws to cause the
  kernel to leak kernel memory to user-space, possibly leading to the
  disclosure of sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2942, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the tcf_act_police_dump() function in the Linux
  kernel network traffic policing implementation. A data structure in
  tcf_act_police_dump() was not initialized properly before being copied to
  user-space. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause an
  information leak. (CVE-2010-3477, Moderate)

  * A missing upper bound integer check was found in the sys_io_submit()
  function in the Linux kernel asynchronous I/O implementation. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause an information leak.
  (CVE-2010-3067, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting CVE-2010-3067.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When two systems using bonding devices in the adaptive load balancing
  (ALB) mode communicated with each other, an endless loop of ARP replies
  started between these two systems due to a faulty MAC address update. With
  this update, the MAC address update no longer creates unneeded ARP replies.
  (BZ#629239)

  * When running the Connectathon NFS Testsuite with certain clients and Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 as the server, nfsvers4, lock, and test2 failed
  the Connectathon test. (BZ#625535)

  * For UDP/UNIX domain sockets, due to insufficient memory barriers in the
  network code, a process sleeping in select() may have missed notifications
  about new data. In rare cases, this bug may have caused a process to sleep
  forever. (BZ#640117)

  * In certain situations, a bug found in either the HTB or TBF network
  packet schedulers in the Linux kernel could have caused a kernel panic when
  using Broadcom network cards with the bnx2 driver. (BZ#624363)

  * Previously, allocating fallback cqr for DASD reserve/release IOCTLs
  failed because it used the memory pool of the respective device. This
  update preallocates sufficient memory for a single reserve/release request.
  (BZ#626828)

  * In some situations a bug prevented "force online" succeeding for a DASD
  device. (BZ#626827)

  * Using the "fsstress" utility may have caused a kernel panic. (BZ#633968)

  * This update introduces additional stack guard patches. (BZ#632515)

  * A bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver handled physical disks
  and management IOCTLs. All physical disks were exported to the disk layer,
  allowing an oops in megasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when completing the IOCTL
  command if a timeout occurred. (BZ#631903)

  * Previously, a warning message was returned when a large amount of
  messages was passed through netconsole and a considerable amount of network
  load was added. With this update, the warning message is no longer
  displayed. (BZ#637729)

  * Executing a large "dd" command (1 to 5GB) on an iSCSI device with the
  qla3xxx driver caused a system crash due to the incorrect storing of a
  private data structure. With this update, the size of the stored data
  structure is checked and the system crashes no longer occur. (BZ#624364)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
