  - CVE-2010-1172
summary: |
  Updated dbus-glib packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  dbus-glib is an add-on library to integrate the standard D-Bus library with
  the GLib main loop and threading model. NetworkManager is a network link
  manager that attempts to keep a wired or wireless network connection active
  at all times.

  It was discovered that dbus-glib did not enforce the "access" flag on
  exported GObject properties. If such a property were read/write internally
  but specified as read-only externally, a malicious, local user could use
  this flaw to modify that property of an application. Such a change could
  impact the application's behavior (for example, if an IP address were
  changed the network may not come up properly after reboot) and possibly
  lead to a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1172)

  Due to the way dbus-glib translates an application's XML definitions of
  service interfaces and properties into C code at application build time,
  applications built against dbus-glib that use read-only properties needed
  to be rebuilt to fully fix the flaw. As such, this update provides
  NetworkManager packages that have been rebuilt against the updated
  dbus-glib packages. No other applications shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5 were affected.

  All dbus-glib and NetworkManager users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  Running instances of NetworkManager must be restarted (service
  NetworkManager restart) for this update to take effect.
