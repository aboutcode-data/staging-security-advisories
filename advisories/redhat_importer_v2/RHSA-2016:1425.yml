summary: |
  An update for rh-nginx18-nginx is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Nginx is a web and proxy server with a focus on high concurrency, performance, and low memory usage.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-nginx18-nginx (1.8.1).

  Security Fix(es):

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the nginx code responsible for saving client request body to a temporary file. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request that would cause nginx worker process to crash. (CVE-2016-4450)

  * It was discovered that nginx could perform an out of bound read and dereference an invalid pointer when resolving CNAME DNS records. An attacker able to manipulate DNS responses received by nginx could use this flaw to cause a worker process to crash if nginx enabled the resolver in its configuration. (CVE-2016-0742)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way nginx resolved certain CNAME DNS records. An attacker able to manipulate DNS responses received by nginx could use this flaw to cause a worker process to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code if nginx enabled the resolver in its configuration. (CVE-2016-0746)

  * It was discovered that nginx did not limit recursion when resolving CNAME DNS records. An attacker able to manipulate DNS responses received by nginx could use this flaw to cause a worker process to use an excessive amount of resources if nginx enabled the resolver in its configuration. (CVE-2016-0747)
