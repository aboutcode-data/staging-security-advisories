  - CVE-2011-1425
summary: |
  Updated xmlsec1 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The XML Security Library is a C library based on libxml2 and OpenSSL that
  implements the XML Digital Signature and XML Encryption standards.

  A flaw was found in the way xmlsec1 handled XML files that contain an XSLT
  transformation specification. A specially-crafted XML file could cause
  xmlsec1 to create or overwrite an arbitrary file while performing the
  verification of a file's digital signature. (CVE-2011-1425)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nicolas Grégoire and Aleksey Sanin for
  reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * xmlsec1 previously used an incorrect search path when searching for
  crypto plug-in libraries, possibly trying to access such libraries using a
  relative path. (BZ#558480, BZ#700467)

  Users of xmlsec1 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,
  all running applications that use the xmlsec1 library must be restarted for
  the update to take effect.
