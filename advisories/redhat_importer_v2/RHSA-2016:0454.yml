summary: |
  Updated ror40-rubygem-actionpack and ror40-rubygem-activerecord packages
  that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat Software
  Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The ror40 collection provides Ruby on Rails version 4.0. Ruby on Rails is
  a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.

  The following issues were corrected in rubygem-actionpack:

  Multiple directory traversal flaws were found in the way the Action View
  component searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed
  untrusted input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker
  could use these flaws to render unexpected files and, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0752, CVE-2016-2097)

  A code injection flaw was found in the way the Action View component
  searched for templates for rendering. If an application passed untrusted
  input to the 'render' method, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could use
  this flaw to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2098)

  A flaw was found in the way the Action Pack component performed MIME type
  lookups. Since queries were cached in a global cache of MIME types, an
  attacker could use this flaw to grow the cache indefinitely, potentially
  resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2016-0751)

  A flaw was found in the Action Pack component's caching of controller
  references. An attacker could use this flaw to cause unbounded memory
  growth, potentially resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-7581)

  A flaw was found in the way the Action Controller component compared user
  names and passwords when performing HTTP basic authentication. Time taken
  to compare strings could differ depending on input, possibly allowing a
  remote attacker to determine valid user names and passwords using a timing
  attack. (CVE-2015-7576)

  The following issue was corrected in rubygem-activerecord:

  A flaw was found in the Active Record component's handling of nested
  attributes in combination with the destroy flag. An attacker could possibly
  use this flaw to set attributes to invalid values or clear all attributes.
  (CVE-2015-7577)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges John Poulin as the original reporter of
  CVE-2016-0752, Jyoti Singh and Tobias Kraze (makandra) as original
  reporters of CVE-2016-2097, Tobias Kraze (makandra) and joernchen
  (Phenoelit) as original reporters of CVE-2016-2098, Aaron Patterson (Red
  Hat) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-0751, Daniel Waterworth as the
  original reporter of CVE-2015-7576, and Justin Coyne as the original
  reporter of CVE-2015-7577.

  All ror40 collection rubygem-actionpack and rubygem-activerecord packages
  users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. All running applications using
  the ror40 collection must be restarted for this update to take effect.
