summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix several security issues are now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way\
  \ PHP processed a deeply nested\narray. A remote attacker could cause the PHP interpreter\
  \ to crash by\nsubmitting an input variable with a deeply nested array. (CVE-2007-1285) \n\
  \nA flaw was found in the way PHP's unserialize() function processed data. If\na remote attacker\
  \ was able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's unserialize()\nfunction, they could possibly execute\
  \ arbitrary code as the apache user.\n(CVE-2007-1286)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the mbstring\
  \ extension set global variables. A\nscript which used the mb_parse_str() function to set\
  \ global variables could\nbe forced to enable the register_globals configuration option, possibly\n\
  resulting in global variable injection. (CVE-2007-1583)\n\nA double free flaw was found in\
  \ PHP's session_decode() function. If a\nremote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to\
  \ PHP's session_decode()\nfunction, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache\
  \ user.\n(CVE-2007-1711)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way PHP's mail() function processed\
  \ header\ndata. If a script sent mail using a Subject header containing a string from\nan\
  \ untrusted source, a remote attacker could send bulk e-mail to unintended\nrecipients. (CVE-2007-1718)\n\
  \nA heap based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A\nscript that could\
  \ be forced to process WBMP images from an untrusted source\ncould result in arbitrary code\
  \ execution. (CVE-2007-1001)\n\nA buffer over-read flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension.\
  \ A script that\ncould be forced to write arbitrary string using a JIS font from an\nuntrusted\
  \ source could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2007-0455)\n\nUsers of PHP should\
  \ upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues."
