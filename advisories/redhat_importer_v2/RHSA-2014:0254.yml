summary: |
  An updated activemq package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache ActiveMQ provides a SOA infrastructure to connect processes across
  heterogeneous systems.

  A flaw was found in Apache Camel's parsing of the FILE_NAME header.
  A remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would
  write the provided message to a file, could provide expression language
  (EL) expressions in the FILE_NAME header, which would be evaluated on the
  server. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context
  of the Camel server process. (CVE-2013-4330)

  It was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets
  to call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to
  a Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code
  execution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)

  It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
  for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
  on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
  application server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity
  processing by default, and provides a configuration directive to re-enable
  it. (CVE-2013-4152)

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
  custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
  native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
  HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  The CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team, and the CVE-2014-0003 issue was discovered by David
  Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.7 are advised to upgrade to
  this updated package, which corrects these issues.
