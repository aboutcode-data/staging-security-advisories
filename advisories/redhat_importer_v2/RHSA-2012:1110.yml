  - CVE-2012-1667
summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  A flaw was found in the way BIND handled zero length resource data records.
  A malicious owner of a DNS domain could use this flaw to create
  specially-crafted DNS resource records that would cause a recursive
  resolver or secondary server to crash or, possibly, disclose portions of
  its memory. (CVE-2012-1667)

  Users of bind are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named)
  will be restarted automatically.
