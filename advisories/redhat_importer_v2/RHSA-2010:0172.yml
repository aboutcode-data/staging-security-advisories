summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes multiple security issues and
  several bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  (RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
  Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
  necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
  architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel Stream
  Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker
  could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in
  a denial of service. (CVE-2010-0008)

  A flaw was found in the way the x86 emulator in KVM loaded segment
  selectors (used for memory segmentation and protection) into segment
  registers. In some guest system configurations, an unprivileged guest user
  could leverage this flaw to crash the guest or possibly escalate their
  privileges within the guest. (CVE-2010-0419)

  The KVM x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
  Privilege Level (CPL) while accessing debug registers. An unprivileged user
  in a guest could leverage this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2009-3722)

  A flaw was found in the USB passthrough handling code in KVM. A
  specially-crafted USB packet sent from inside a guest could be used to
  trigger a buffer overflow in the usb_host_handle_control() function, which
  runs under the QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could
  leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest hang or crash) or
  possibly escalate their privileges within the host. (CVE-2010-0297)

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
  Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2009-4308, CVE-2010-0003,
  CVE-2010-0007, CVE-2010-0415, and CVE-2010-0437; and sudo issues
  CVE-2010-0426 and CVE-2010-0427.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * the required storage device driver was not detected correctly by mkdumprd
  when using multipath devices. When RHEV Hypervisor was installed on a
  multipath device, kdump was unable to mount the logical volume to store the
  kernel core dump; therefore, the core dump would not be recorded. With this
  update, multipath support has been added to the mkdumprd tool, which
  resolves this issue. (BZ#569459)

  As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from KVM updates
  RHSA-2010:0126 and RHBA-2010:0158 have been included in this update:

  https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0126.html
  https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0158.html

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
