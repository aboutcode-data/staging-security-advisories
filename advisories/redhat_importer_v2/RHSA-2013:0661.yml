  - CVE-2013-0871
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's ptrace
  implementation handled PTRACE_SETREGS requests when the debuggee was woken
  due to a SIGKILL signal instead of being stopped. A local, unprivileged
  user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-0871,
  Important)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Due to the incorrect validation of a pointer dereference in the
  d_validate() function, running a command such as ls or find on the
  MultiVersion File System (MVFS), used by IBM Rational ClearCase, for
  example, could trigger a kernel panic. This update modifies d_validate() to
  verify the parent-child dentry relationship by searching through the
  parent's d_child list. The kernel no longer panics in this situation.
  (BZ#915580)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to resolve these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
