summary: |
  Updated Apache httpd packages that correct two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Application Stack.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

  A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_status module. On sites
  where the server-status page is publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus is
  enabled, this flaw could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. On Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux, the server-status page is not enabled by default and it
  is best practice to not make this publicly available. (CVE-2006-5752)

  A bug was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_cache module. On sites where
  caching is enabled, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted
  request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to
  crash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded
  Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-1863)

  The Apache HTTP Server did not verify that a process was an Apache child
  process before sending it signals. A local attacker with the ability to run
  scripts on the Apache HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and cause
  arbitrary processes to be terminated which could lead to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2007-3304).

  Users of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. Users should restart Apache
  after installing this update.
