summary: |
  Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The java-1.7.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime
  Environment and the OpenJDK 7 Java Software Development Kit.

  A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK verified
  bytecode from the class files. An untrusted Java application or applet
  could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
  (CVE-2014-6601)

  Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JAX-WS,
  and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet
  could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0412,
  CVE-2015-0408)

  A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot garbage collector handled phantom
  references. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to
  corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0395)

  A flaw was found in the way the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) decoder
  in the Security component in OpenJDK handled negative length values. A
  specially crafted, DER-encoded input could cause a Java application to
  enter an infinite loop when decoded. (CVE-2015-0410)

  A flaw was found in the way the SSL 3.0 protocol handled padding bytes when
  decrypting messages that were encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block
  chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw could possibly allow a man-in-the-middle
  (MITM) attacker to decrypt portions of the cipher text using a padding
  oracle attack. (CVE-2014-3566)

  Note: This update disables SSL 3.0 by default to address this issue.
  The jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property can be used to re-enable
  SSL 3.0 support if needed. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat
  Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section.

  It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component in
  OpenJDK failed to properly check whether the ChangeCipherSpec was received
  during the SSL/TLS connection handshake. An MITM attacker could possibly
  use this flaw to force a connection to be established without encryption
  being enabled. (CVE-2014-6593)

  An information leak flaw was found in the Swing component in OpenJDK. An
  untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain
  Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0407)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MulticastSocket
  implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java
  application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass certain Java
  sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2014-6587)

  Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code in the 2D
  component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could allow an
  untrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions of the Java
  Virtual Machine memory. (CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6591)

  Multiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the
  Hotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error log
  files. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK
  overwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack. (CVE-2015-0383)

  The CVE-2015-0383 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

  All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
  must be restarted for the update to take effect.
