  - CVE-2010-0013
summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  A directory traversal flaw was discovered in Pidgin's MSN protocol
  implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted emoticon
  image download request that would cause Pidgin to disclose an arbitrary
  file readable to the user running Pidgin. (CVE-2010-0013)

  These packages upgrade Pidgin to version 2.6.5. Refer to the Pidgin release
  notes for a full list of changes: http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  this issue. Pidgin must be restarted for this update to take effect.
