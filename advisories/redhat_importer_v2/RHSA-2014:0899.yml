  - CVE-2014-0187
  - CVE-2014-4167
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-neutron packages provide Openstack Networking (neutron), the virtual network service.

  OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines.

  It was discovered that an authenticated user could add a security group rule with an invalid CIDR causing the openvswitch-agent process to fail and prevent further rules from being applied. (CVE-2014-0187)

  It was discovered that an authenticated user could add an IPv6 private subnet to an L3 router causing L3-agent to break in a way that prevents further IPv4 addresses from being attached. Removal of the faulty network can only be done directly at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are affected by this issue. (CVE-2014-4167)

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds enhancements:

  * Previously, running 'cloud-init' resulted in each instance sending requests to the metadata agent, which in turn queried Networking server.
  Consequently, booting multiple concurrent instances resulted in metadata agent queries producing heavy load for 'neutron-server'.
  This update addresses this issue by implementing a short lifetime cache for the metadata agent. Metadata agent now only queries Networking when data is not present in its cache, with the result of decreased load on Networking server during 'cloud-init' within instances. (BZ#1101494).

  * With this update, Networking (neutron) packages now update the '/etc/sudoers.d/neutron' file. Consequently, any local changes have been relocated to the '/etc/sudoers.d/neutron.rpmsave' file, and will need to be merged back manually.
  To avoid the need for manual updates in future, please apply local changes in a separate 'sudoers.d' file. (BZ#1115406)

  * Previously, Networking would fail to reliably communicate with Qpid. This behavior was due to an incorrect message subject set in the Qpid layer used by Networking.
  This update addresses this issue by setting a correct subject when sending a Qpid message. As a result, Networking now works reliably with the new Qpid server. (BZ#1108549)

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
