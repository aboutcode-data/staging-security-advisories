  An update for python-werkzeug is now available for Red Hat OpenStack
  Platform 17.0 (Wallaby).

  Werkzeug ======== Werkzeug started as simple collection of various
  utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced
  WSGI utility modules. It includes a powerful debugger, full featured
  request and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache
  control headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL
  routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules. Werkzeug
  is unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template engine, database
  adapter or anything else. It doesn't even enforce a specific way of
  handling requests and leaves all that up to the developer. It's most useful
  for end user applications which should work on as many server environments
  as possible (such as blogs, wikis, bulletin boards, etc.).

  Security Fix(es):

  * high resource usage when parsing multipart form data with many fields
  (CVE-2023-25577)
