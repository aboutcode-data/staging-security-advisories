  - CVE-2004-0078
summary: |
  New mutt packages that fix a remotely-triggerable crash in the menu drawing
  code are now available.

  Mutt is a text-mode mail user agent.

  A bug was found in the index menu code in versions of mutt.  A remote
  attacker could send a carefully crafted mail message that can cause mutt
  to segfault and possibly execute arbitrary code as the victim.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-0078 to this issue.

  It is recommended that all mutt users upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank Niels Heinen for reporting this issue.
