  - CVE-2015-1867
summary: "Updated pacemaker packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are \nnow\
  \ available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update\
  \ as having Moderate security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\
  \ which\ngives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences\
  \ section.\n\nThe Pacemaker Resource Manager is a collection of technologies working\ntogether\
  \ to provide data integrity and the ability to maintain application\navailability in the event\
  \ of a failure.\n\nA flaw was found in the way pacemaker, a cluster resource manager,\nevaluated\
  \ added nodes in certain situations. A user with read-only access\ncould potentially assign\
  \ any other existing roles to themselves and then\nadd privileges to other users as well.\
  \ (CVE-2015-1867)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Due to a race condition,\
  \ nodes that gracefully shut down occasionally had\ndifficulty rejoining the cluster. As a\
  \ consequence, nodes could come online\nand be shut down again immediately by the cluster.\
  \ This bug has been fixed,\nand the \"shutdown\" attribute is now cleared properly. (BZ#1198638)\n\
  \n* Prior to this update, the pacemaker utility caused an unexpected\ntermination of the attrd\
  \ daemon after a system update to Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 6.6. The bug has been fixed so\
  \ that attrd no longer crashes when\npacemaker starts. (BZ#1205292)\n\n* Previously, the access\
  \ control list (ACL) of the pacemaker utility\nallowed a role assignment to the Cluster Information\
  \ Base (CIB) with a\nread-only permission. With this update, ACL is enforced and can no longer\n\
  be bypassed by the user without the write permission, thus fixing this bug.\n(BZ#1207621)\n\
  \n* Prior to this update, the ClusterMon (crm_mon) utility did not trigger an\nexternal agent\
  \ script with the \"-E\" parameter to monitor the Cluster\nInformation Base (CIB) when the\
  \ pacemaker utility was used. A patch has\nbeen provided to fix this bug, and crm_mon now\
  \ calls the agent script when\nthe \"-E\" parameter is used. (BZ#1208896)\n\nUsers of pacemaker\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct\
  \ these issues."
