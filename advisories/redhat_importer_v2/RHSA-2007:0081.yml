summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix several security issues are now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nA number of buffer overflow flaws were found\
  \ in the PHP session extension;\nthe str_replace() function; and the imap_mail_compose() function.\
  \ If very\nlong strings were passed to the str_replace() function, an integer\noverflow could\
  \ occur in memory allocation. If a script used the\nimap_mail_compose() function to create\
  \ a new MIME message based on an\ninput body from an untrusted source, it could result in\
  \ a heap overflow.\nAn attacker with access to a PHP application affected by any these issues\n\
  could trigger the flaws and possibly execute arbitrary code as the\n'apache' user. (CVE-2007-0906)\n\
  \nWhen unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms, the\nzend_hash_init() function could\
  \ be forced into an infinite loop, consuming\nCPU resources for a limited time, until the\
  \ script timeout alarm aborted\nexecution of the script. (CVE-2007-0988)\n\nIf the wddx extension\
  \ was used to import WDDX data from an untrusted\nsource, certain WDDX input packets could\
  \ expose a random portion of heap\nmemory. (CVE-2007-0908)\n\nIf the odbc_result_all() function\
  \ was used to display data from a database,\nand the database table contents were under an\
  \ attacker's control, a format\nstring vulnerability was possible which could allow arbitrary\
  \ code\nexecution. (CVE-2007-0909)\n\nA one byte memory read always occurs before the beginning\
  \ of a buffer. This\ncould be triggered, for example, by any use of the header() function\
  \ in a\nscript. However it is unlikely that this would have any effect.\n(CVE-2007-0907)\n\
  \nSeveral flaws in PHP could allow attackers to \"clobber\" certain\nsuper-global variables\
  \ via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2007-0910)\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like\
  \ to thank Stefan Esser for his help diagnosing these issues."
