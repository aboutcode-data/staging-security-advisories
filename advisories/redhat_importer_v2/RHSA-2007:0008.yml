  - CVE-2006-6107
summary: |
  Updated dbus packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  D-BUS is a system for sending messages between applications. It is used
  both for the systemwide message bus service, and as a
  per-user-login-session messaging facility.

  Kimmo Hämäläinen discovered a flaw in the way D-BUS processes certain
  messages. It is possible for a local unprivileged D-BUS process to disrupt
  the ability of another D-BUS process to receive messages. (CVE-2006-6107)

  Users of dbus are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct this issue.
