  - CVE-2009-2416
summary: |
  Updated libxml and libxml2 packages that fix multiple security issues are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A Document Type
  Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also which elements can be
  used) for certain types of files, such as XML files.

  A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the root XML
  document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a local, unsuspecting
  user, would lead to denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2009-2414)

  Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses the
  Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker could provide
  a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a local, unsuspecting
  user, would lead to denial of service (application crash). (CVE-2009-2416)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to resolve these issues. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, they
  contain backported patches for the libxml and libxml2 packages. For Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, they contain backported patches for the libxml2
  packages. The desktop must be restarted (log out, then log back in) for
  this update to take effect.
