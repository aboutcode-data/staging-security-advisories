summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1, which fixes several security issues,
  multiple bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid is a distributed in-memory data grid, based on
  Infinispan.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1 serves as a replacement for
  Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.0. It includes various bug fixes and
  enhancements, which are detailed in the Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1
  Release Notes. The Release Notes are available at:
  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Data_Grid/

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for
  Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an
  exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the
  attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack.
  The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain
  text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

  A resource consumption issue was found in the way Xerces-J handled XML
  declarations. A remote attacker could use an XML document with a specially
  crafted declaration using a long pseudo-attribute name that, when parsed by
  an application using Xerces-J, would cause that application to use an
  excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2013-4002)

  It was found that the RESTEasy DocumentProvider did not set the
  external-parameter-entities and external-general-entities features
  appropriately, thus allowing external entity expansion. A remote attacker
  able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use this flaw to
  read files accessible to the user running the application server, and
  potentially perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.
  (CVE-2014-7839)

  It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the
  requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature
  wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the
  contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

  It was discovered that under specific conditions the conversation state
  information stored in a thread-local variable in JBoss Weld was not
  sanitized correctly when the conversation ended. This could lead to a race
  condition that could potentially expose sensitive information from a
  previous conversation to the current conversation. (CVE-2014-8122)

  Red Hat would like to thank Rune Steinseth of JProfessionals for reporting
  the CVE-2014-8122 issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1.
