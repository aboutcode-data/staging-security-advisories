summary: |
  An update for the Apache Tomcat 7 component for JBoss Enterprise Web Server
  2.0.0 that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container.

  It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
  protected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  prevention filter. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
  CSRF attacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter
  and do not contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).
