summary: |
  Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
  machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
  and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
  64-bit operating systems.

  The rhevm-spice-client package includes the mingw-virt-viewer Windows SPICE
  client. OpenSSL, a general purpose cryptography library with a TLS
  implementation, is bundled with mingw-virt-viewer. The mingw-virt-viewer
  package has been updated to correct the following issues:

  An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
  DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
  could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
  limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
  Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
  sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
  padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled
  TLS/SSL protocol handshake packets. A specially crafted handshake packet
  could cause a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2013-4353)

  It was discovered that the TLS/SSL protocol could leak information about
  plain text when optional compression was used. An attacker able to control
  part of the plain text sent over an encrypted TLS/SSL connection could
  possibly use this flaw to recover other portions of the plain text.
  (CVE-2012-4929)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting
  CVE-2014-0160. Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the
  original reporter.

  The updated mingw-virt-viewer Windows SPICE client further includes OpenSSL
  security fixes that have no security impact on mingw-virt-viewer itself.
  The security fixes included in this update address the following CVE
  numbers:

  CVE-2013-6449, CVE-2013-6450, CVE-2012-2686, and CVE-2013-0166

  All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
  to these updated packages, which address these issues.
