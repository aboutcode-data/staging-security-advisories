aliases:
  - CVE-2016-3068
  - CVE-2016-3069
summary: |
  An update for mercurial is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Mercurial is a fast, lightweight source control management system designed for efficient handling of very large distributed projects.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that Mercurial failed to properly check Git sub-repository URLs. A Mercurial repository that includes a Git sub-repository with a specially crafted URL could cause Mercurial to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-3068)

  * It was discovered that the Mercurial convert extension failed to sanitize special characters in Git repository names. A Git repository with a specially crafted name could cause Mercurial to execute arbitrary code when the Git repository was converted to a Mercurial repository. (CVE-2016-3069)

  Red Hat would like to thank Blake Burkhart for reporting these issues.
