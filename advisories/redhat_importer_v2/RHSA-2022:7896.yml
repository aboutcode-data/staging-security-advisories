  - CVE-2022-3171
summary: |
  A security update for Debezium is now available for Red Hat Integration.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Debezium is a distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond immediately to each row-level change in the databases.

  Debezium is built on top of Apache Kafka and provides Kafka Connect compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, from where your application consumes them. This makes it possible for your application to easily consume all of the events correctly and completely. Even if your application stops unexpectedly, it will not miss anything: when the application restarts, it will resume consuming the events where it left off.

  Security Fix(es):

  * protobuf-java: potential DoS in the parsing procedure for binary data (CVE-2021-22569)

  * protobuf-java: timeout in parser leads to DoS (CVE-2022-3171)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
