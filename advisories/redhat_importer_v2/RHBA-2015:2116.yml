  - CVE-2016-3190
summary: "Updated GTK+ packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements are now available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nThe GTK+ packages contain the GIMP ToolKit (GTK+), a\
  \ library for creating graphical user interfaces for the X Window System. \n\nThis update\
  \ contains a number of rebases to the latest upstream stable versions, which provides a number\
  \ of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous versions. For more information on the changes,\
  \ see the GNOME release notes and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Release Notes.\n\nThe orc packages\
  \ have been upgraded to version 0.4.22. (BZ#1174391)\nThe atk packages have been upgraded\
  \ to version 2.14.0. (BZ#1174433)\nThe cairo packages have been upgraded to version 1.14.2.\
  \ (BZ#1174435)\nThe pango packages have been upgraded to version 1.36.8. (BZ#1174436)\nThe\
  \ gdk-pixbuf2 packages have been upgraded to version 2.31.1. (BZ#1174438)\nThe gobject-introspection\
  \ packages have been upgraded to version 1.42.0. (BZ#1174439)\nThe glib-networking packages\
  \ have been upgraded to version 2.42.2. (BZ#1174447)\nThe dconf packages have been upgraded\
  \ to version 0.22.0. (BZ#1174448)\nThe gtksourceview3 packages have been upgraded to version\
  \ 3.14.2. (BZ#1174500)\nThe json-glib packages have been upgraded to version 1.0.2. (BZ#1174501)\n\
  The webkitgtk3 packages have been upgraded to version 2.4.9. (BZ#1174556)\nThe glibmm24 packages\
  \ have been upgraded to version 2.42.0. (BZ#1174565)\nThe harfbuzz packages have been upgraded\
  \ to version 0.9.36. (BZ#1201148)\nThe libxklavier packages have been upgraded to version\
  \ 5.4. (BZ#1202874)\nThe glib2 packages have been upgraded to version 2.42.2. (BZ#1203755)\n\
  The gtk2 packages have been upgraded to version 2.24.28. (BZ#1221171)\n\nThis update also\
  \ fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, GTK+ was treating frame times from _NET_WM_FRAME_DRAWN\
  \ and\n_NET_WM_FRAME_TIMINGS as local monotonic times, but they are actually\nextended-precision\
  \ versions of the server time. This was causing rendering stalls when using GTK+ applications\
  \ remotely. With this update, frame times are converted to monotonic times when the X server\
  \ and client are not running on the same system, and GTK+ applications can be used remotely\
  \ without rendering stalls. (BZ#1243646) \n\n* Previously, the glib2 packages were rebased\
  \ to a version that deprecated the g_memmove() function. As a consequence, libgsf failed to\
  \ build from source. This update replaces g_memmove() with memmove(), thus fixing this bug.\
  \ (BZ#1132679)\n\n* Prior to this update, the Python plug-in for GDB did not work with the\
  \ version of GDB in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1. As a consequence, GDB returned error messages\
  \ when debugging glib2 applications. This update applies an upstream fix to use newer GDB\
  \ APIs, and the Python GDB debugging aid for glib2 applications now works as expected. (BZ#1055733)\n\
  \n* The glib2 utility previously returned confusing warning messages when programs added GObject\
  \ properties after the class was initialized. The functionality of adding a property after\
  \ the class was initialized has been added back due to backward compatibility concerns, and\
  \ error messages on properties thus no longer appear. (BZ#1168600)\n\n* When selecting a file\
  \ in the \"Add attachment\" window, Evolution previously terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation\
  \ fault. This update fixes the gtk_tree_row_ref_deleted() function causing this bug, and attaching\
  \ a file no longer leads to a crash. (BZ#1175941)\n\n* Previously, the CUPS back end checked\
  \ an incorrect port to connect to remote printers. Consequently, fetching printer information\
  \ failed and the \"Print\" button became insensitive. This update makes sure CUPS checks the\
  \ correct port, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1221157, BZ#1154038)\n\nUsers of GTK+ are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs and add these enhancements."
