summary: "Updated VNC packages are available to fix a weak cookie vulnerability.\n\nVNC is a\
  \ tool for providing a remote graphical user interface.  \n\nThe VNC server acts as an X server,\
  \ but the script for starting it\ngenerates an MIT X cookie (which is used for X authentication)\
  \ without\nusing a strong enough random number generator.  This could allow an\nattacker to\
  \ be able to more easily guess the authentication cookie.\n\nAll users of VNC are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a patch to correct this issue."
