summary: "New XFree86 packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0 are now available which include\nseveral\
  \ security fixes, bug fixes, enhancements, and driver updates.\n\n[Updated: June 30, 2003]\n\
  The XFree86 4.2.1-20 packages which were originally released in this\nadvisory were accidentally\
  \ built with debugging info enabled due to a\ntemporary problem with our build system.  Unfortunately,\
  \ this problem was\nnot noticed during package testing, and caused the new XFree86 packages\
  \ to\ncontain full debug symbol data, resulting in extremely large packages.\n\nNote that\
  \ the previously released packages are functional and should not\ncause any problems on systems\
  \ with adequate disk space.  However we are\nreleasing new XFree86 4.2.1-21 packages to both\
  \ minimize the download time\nfor people that have not yet updated XFree86 on their systems,\
  \ and to\nminimize the disk space footprint caused by this issue.  Additionally, our\ntesting\
  \ procedures have also been updated to automatically catch similar\nissues in the future.\n\
  \nRed Hat apologizes for any inconvenience this may have caused you.\n\nXFree86 is an implementation\
  \ of the X Window System providing the core\ngraphical user interface and video drivers in\
  \ Red Hat Linux. \n\nA number of security vulnerabilities have been discovered in XFree86\
  \ 4.2.0:\n\n- Xterm, provided as part of the XFree86 packages, provides an escape\nsequence\
  \ for reporting the current window title. This escape sequence\nessentially takes the current\
  \ title and places it directly on the command\nline. An attacker can craft an escape sequence\
  \ that sets the victim's Xterm\nwindow title to an arbitrary command, and then reports it\
  \ to the command\nline. Since it is not possible to embed a carriage return into the window\n\
  title, the attacker would then have to convince the victim to press Enter\nfor the shell to\
  \ process the title as a command, although the attacker\ncould craft other escape sequences\
  \ that might convince the victim to do so.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0063 to this issue.\n\n- It is possible\
  \ to lock up versions of Xterm by sending an invalid DEC\nUDK escape sequence. (CAN-2003-0071)\n\
  \n- XFree86 4.2.1 also contains an updated fix for CAN-2002-0164, a\nvulnerability in the\
  \ MIT-SHM extension of the X server that allows local\nusers to read and write arbitrary shared\
  \ memory. The original fix did not\ncover the case where the X server is started from xdm.\n\
  \n- The X server was setting the /dev/dri directory permissions incorrectly,\nwhich resulted\
  \ in the directory being world writable. It now sets the\ndirectory permissions to a safe\
  \ value.  (CAN-2001-1409)\n\nDriver updates and additions:\n\n- Savage driver updated to Tim\
  \ Roberts' latest version 1.1.27t.\n\n- Added new \"cyrix\" driver from Alan Cox, which works\
  \ much better on\n  MediaGX hardware.\n\n- Added new input drivers from Alan Cox for Fujitsu\
  \ Stylistic (fpit),\n  Palmax PD1000/PD1100 Input driver (palmax), Union Reality UR-98\n \
  \ head tracker (ur98)\n\n- Backported apm driver from XFree86 CVS, DPMS support enhancements,\
  \ and a   \n  few accel fixes\n\n- Backported ark driver from XFree86 CVS\n\n- Backported\
  \ chips driver from XFree86 CVS, with hardware mouse\n  cursor and 2D accleration fixes.\n\
  \n- Backported cirrus i740, siliconmotion, and ark drivers from XFree86 CVS\n\nVarious bug\
  \ fixes and enhancements:\n\n- Bug fixes for the RENDER extension and libraries which improve\
  \ stability\n\n- Various fixes to the Xaw library\n\n- A long standing problem in the X server\
  \ has been fixed in which \n  the mouse, keyboard, or video would hang, or the server to go\
  \ into an \n  endless loop whenever the system time was changed backward while X was \n  running\n\
  \n- Fixed a bug in both the Radeon and Rage 128 drivers which caused\n  crashes while using\
  \ VMware with DGA when DRI is enabled\n\n- The Matrox \"mga\" driver had some problems with\
  \ multihead and the RENDER\n  extension which have been worked around.\n\n- fc-cache is now\
  \ run upon font package installation in all font\n  directories containing fonts managed by\
  \ fontconfig/Xft\n\n- mkfontdir has been modified to force the permissions of the files it\n\
  \  generates to be mode 0644 ensuring they are world readable independant of\n  umask.\n\n\
  - Added a new option \"ForceLegacyCRT\" to the radeon driver to allow use \n  of legacy VGA\
  \ monitors which can not be detected automatically. This \n  option is only safe to use in\
  \ single-head setups and may cause serious \n  problems if used with dual-head.\n\n- xterm\
  \ session management is now enabled by default, whereas the stock\n  XFree86 default in 4.2.0/4.2.1\
  \ was accidentally disabled upstream\n\n- Removed and obsoleted the XFree86-xtrap-clients\
  \ package, and merged it\n  into the main XFree86 package to simplify packaging\n\nThere are\
  \ various other fixes included which users can review by examining\nthe RPM package changelog\
  \ of any of the new XFree86 packages.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated XFree86\
  \ 4.2.1 packages, which\nare not vulnerable to the previously mentioned security issues."
