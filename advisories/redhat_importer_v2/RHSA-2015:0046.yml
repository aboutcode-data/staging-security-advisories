summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2014-8634, CVE-2014-8639, CVE-2014-8641)

  It was found that the Beacon interface implementation in Firefox did not
  follow the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) specification. A web page
  containing malicious content could allow a remote attacker to conduct a
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attack. (CVE-2014-8638)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Patrick McManus, Muneaki Nishimura,
  Xiaofeng Zheng, and Mitchell Harper as the original reporters of these
  issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 31.4.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The default dictionary for Firefox's spell checker is now correctly set
  to the system's locale language. (BZ#643954, BZ#1150572)

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 31.4.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
