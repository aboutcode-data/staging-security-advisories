summary: |
  Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix multiple security issues
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users with a
  graphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based
  resources.

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way orchestration
  templates were handled. An owner of such a template could use this flaw to
  perform XSS attacks against other Horizon users. (CVE-2014-3473)

  It was found that network names were not sanitized. A malicious user could
  use this flaw to perform XSS attacks against other Horizon users by
  creating a network with a specially crafted name. (CVE-2014-3474)

  It was found that certain email addresses were not sanitized. An
  administrator could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks against other
  Horizon users by storing an email address that has a specially crafted
  name. (CVE-2014-3475)

  A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the horizon host
  aggregate interface. A user with sufficient privileges to add a host
  aggregate could potentially use this flaw to capture the credentials of
  another user. (CVE-2014-3594)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Jason Hullinger from Hewlett Packard as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-3473, Craig Lorentzen from Cisco as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-3474, Michael Xin from Rackspace as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-3475, and Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich
  from the Horst Görtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum as
  the original reporter of CVE-2014-3594.

  All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
