summary: |
  Updated java-1.5.0-bea packages that correct several security issues are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extras and 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The BEA WebLogic JRockit 1.5.0_14 JRE and SDK contain BEA WebLogic JRockit
  Virtual Machine 1.5.0_14, and are certified for the Java 5 Platform,
  Standard Edition, v1.5.0.

  A flaw was found in the Java XSLT processing classes. An untrusted
  application or applet could cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary
  code with the permissions of the user running the JRE. (CVE-2008-1187)

  A flaw was found in the JRE image parsing libraries. An untrusted
  application or applet could cause a denial of service, or possibly execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the JRE.
  (CVE-2008-1193)

  A flaw was found in the JRE color management library. An untrusted
  application or applet could trigger a denial of service (JVM crash).
  (CVE-2008-1194)

  The vulnerabilities concerning applets listed above can only be triggered
  in java-1.5.0-bea, by calling the "appletviewer" application.

  Users of java-1.5.0-bea are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which resolve these issues.
