summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
  images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
  and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  A flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service where a
  tenant could manipulate the status of their images by submitting an
  HTTP PUT request together with an 'x-image-meta-status' header. A
  malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images,
  bypass storage quotas, and in some cases replace image contents (where
  they have owner access). Setups using the Image service's v1 API could
  allow the illegal modification of image status. Additionally, setups
  which also use the v2 API could allow a subsequent re-upload of image
  contents. (CVE-2015-5251)

  A race-condition flaw was discovered in the OpenStack Image service.
  When images in the upload state were deleted using a token close to
  expiration, untracked image data could accumulate in the back end.
  Because untracked data does not count towards the storage quota, an
  attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service through
  resource exhaustion. (CVE-2015-5286)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace as the
  original reporter of CVE-2015-5251, and Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin of
  Mirantis as the original reporters of CVE-2015-5286.

  All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, running Image service services will be restarted
  automatically.
