  - CVE-2005-2491
summary: "Updated exim packages that fix a security issue in PCRE and a free space\ncomputation\
  \ on large file system bug are now available for Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update\
  \ has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\
  \nExim is a mail transport agent (MTA) developed at the University of\nCambridge for use on\
  \ Unix systems connected to the Internet.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in PCRE, a\
  \ Perl-compatible regular\nexpression library included within Exim.  A local user could create\
  \ a\nmaliciously crafted regular expression in such as way that they could gain\nthe privileges\
  \ of the 'exim' user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2005-2491 to this issue.  These\nerratum packages change Exim to use the system PCRE\
  \ library instead of the\ninternal one.  \n\nThese packages also fix a minor flaw where the\
  \ Exim Monitor was incorrectly\ncomputing free space on very large file systems.\n\nUsers\
  \ should upgrade to these erratum packages and also ensure they have\nupdated the system PCRE\
  \ library, for which erratum packages are available\nseperately in RHSA-2005:761"
