summary: |
  An update for libtiff is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) files.

  Security Fix(es):

  * LibTiff: DoS from Divide By Zero Error (CVE-2022-2056, CVE-2022-2057, CVE-2022-2058)

  * libtiff: Double free or corruption in rotateImage() function at tiffcrop.c (CVE-2022-2519)

  * libtiff: uint32_t underflow leads to out of bounds read and write in tiffcrop.c (CVE-2022-2867)

  * libtiff: tiffcrop.c has uint32_t underflow which leads to out of bounds read and write in extractContigSamples8bits() (CVE-2022-2869)

  * libtiff: tiffcrop: heap-buffer-overflow in extractImageSection in tiffcrop.c (CVE-2022-2953)

  * libtiff: Assertion fail in rotateImage() function at tiffcrop.c (CVE-2022-2520)

  * libtiff: Invalid pointer free operation in TIFFClose() at tif_close.c (CVE-2022-2521)

  * libtiff: Invalid crop_width and/or crop_length could cause an out-of-bounds read in reverseSamples16bits() (CVE-2022-2868)
