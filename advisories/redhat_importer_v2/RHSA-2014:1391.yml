summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
  two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name
  Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
  Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way the glibc's readdir_r()
  function handled file system entries longer than the NAME_MAX character
  constant. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted NTFS or CIFS
  file system that, when processed by an application using readdir_r(), would
  cause that application to crash or, potentially, allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2013-4237)

  It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory
  used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application
  resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause
  the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-4458)

  These updated glibc packages also include several bug fixes and two
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the most
  significant of these changes.

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
