  - CVE-2014-8106
summary: |
  An updated qemu-kvm package that fixes one security issue and one bug is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  It was found that the Cirrus blit region checks were insufficient. A
  privileged guest user could use this flaw to write outside of VRAM-
  allocated buffer boundaries in the host's QEMU process address space with
  attacker-provided data. (CVE-2014-8106)

  This issue was found by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, the effective downtime during the last phase of a live
  migration would sometimes be much higher than the maximum downtime
  specified by 'migration_downtime' in vdsm.conf. This problem has been
  corrected. The value of 'migration_downtime' is now honored and the
  migration is aborted if the downtime cannot be achieved. (BZ#1142756)

  All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
