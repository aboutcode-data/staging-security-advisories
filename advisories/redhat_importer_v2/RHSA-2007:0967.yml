aliases:
  - CVE-2007-1659
  - CVE-2007-1660
summary: |
  Updated pcre packages that correct two security flaws are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  PCRE is a Perl-compatible regular expression library.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way pcre handles certain malformed regular
  expressions. If an application linked against pcre, such as Konqueror,
  parses a malicious regular expression, it may be possible to run arbitrary
  code as the user running the application. (CVE-2007-1659, CVE-2007-1660)

  Users of pcre are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry for properly
  disclosing these issues.
