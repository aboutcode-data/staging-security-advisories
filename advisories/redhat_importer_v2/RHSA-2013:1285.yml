  - CVE-2013-4294
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  It was found that Keystone did not correctly handle revoked PKI tokens,
  allowing users with revoked tokens to retain access to resources they
  should no longer be able to access. This issue only affected systems using
  PKI tokens with the memcache or KVS token back ends. (CVE-2013-4294)

  Red Hat would like to thank Thierry Carrez of OpenStack upstream for
  reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Kieran Spear of University of
  Melbourne as the original reporter.

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
  automatically.
