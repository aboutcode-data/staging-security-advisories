  - CVE-2017-7718
summary: |
  An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for RHEV 3.X Hypervisor and Agents for RHEL-7 and RHEV 4.X RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An out-of-bounds access issue was found in QEMU's Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support. The vulnerability could occur while copying VGA data using bitblt functions (for example, cirrus_bitblt_rop_fwd_transp_). A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-7718)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jiangxin (PSIRT Huawei Inc.) for reporting
  CVE-2017-7718.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * When using post-copy migration with the virtio Random Number Generator (RNG) device, virtio-rng continued generating data while the migration was already in post-copy mode. Consequently, the migration sometimes failed and the error message "Failed to load virtio-rng:virtio" was displayed. The source code has been improved and the problem no longer occurs in the scenario described. (BZ#1450375)
