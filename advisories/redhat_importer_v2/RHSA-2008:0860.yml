  - CVE-2008-3274
summary: |
  Updated ipa packages that fix a security flaw are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise IPA.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Enterprise IPA is an integrated solution to provide
  centrally-managed Identity (machines, users, virtual machines, groups,
  authentication credentials), Policy (configuration settings, access control
  information) and Audit (events, logs, analysis) services.

  A flaw was found in the Red Hat Enterprise IPA installation procedure. The
  master Kerberos password was set up in the LDAP server in such a way that
  it was possible to retrieve the password via an anonymous LDAP connection.
  (CVE-2008-3274)

  Note: the master Kerberos password is used to encrypt keys. This flaw does
  not lead to individual keys being exposed.

  Users of Red Hat IPA should upgrade to these updated packages and perform
  the operations explained in the solution to resolve this issue.
