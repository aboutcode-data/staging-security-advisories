summary: |
  Updated Ethereal packages that fix a number of exploitable security issues
  are now available.

  Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

  A number of security issues affect Ethereal.  By exploiting these issues,
  it may be possible to make Ethereal crash or run arbitrary code by
  injecting a purposefully-malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing
  someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

  A buffer overflow in Ethereal 0.9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
  malformed GTP MSISDN string.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0925 to
  this issue.

  Ethereal 0.9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (crash) via certain malformed ISAKMP or MEGACO packets.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0926 to this issue.

  A heap-based buffer overflow in Ethereal 0.9.15 and earlier allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
  execute arbitrary code via the SOCKS dissector.  The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0927
  to this issue.

  Users of Ethereal should update to these erratum packages containing
  Ethereal version 0.9.16, which is not vulnerable to these issues.
