summary: |
  Updated ImageMagick packages that fix three security issues and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
  System that can read and write multiple image formats.

  A flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images with malformed
  Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a victim, would cause
  ImageMagick to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2012-0247)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images
  with malformed Exif metadata. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
  image file that, when opened by a victim, could cause ImageMagick to enter
  an infinite loop. (CVE-2012-0248)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick decoded certain
  JPEG images. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image with
  specially-crafted sequences of RST0 up to RST7 restart markers (used to
  indicate the input stream to be corrupted), which once processed by
  ImageMagick, would cause it to consume excessive amounts of memory and CPU
  time. (CVE-2012-0260)

  Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2012-0260. CERT-FI
  acknowledges Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto, Tuomas Parttimaa and
  Lasse Ylivainio of Codenomicon's CROSS project as the original reporters.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The fix for Red Hat Bugzilla bug 694922, provided by the RHSA-2012:0301
  ImageMagick update, introduced a regression. Attempting to use the
  "convert" utility to convert a PostScript document could fail with a
  "/undefinedfilename" error. With this update, conversion works as expected.
  (BZ#804546)

  Users of ImageMagick are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  instances of ImageMagick must be restarted for this update to take effect.
