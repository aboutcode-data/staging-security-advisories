  - CVE-2015-2775
summary: |
  Updated mailman packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Mailman is a program used to help manage email discussion lists.

  It was found that mailman did not sanitize the list name before passing it
  to certain MTAs. A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code as the user running mailman. (CVE-2015-2775)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, it was impossible to configure Mailman in a way that
  Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) would
  recognize Sender alignment for Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM)
  signatures. Consequently, Mailman list subscribers that belonged to a mail
  server with a "reject" policy for DMARC, such as yahoo.com or AOL.com, were
  unable to receive Mailman forwarded messages from senders residing in any
  domain that provided DKIM signatures. With this update, domains with a
  "reject" DMARC policy are recognized correctly, and Mailman list
  administrators are able to configure the way these messages are handled. As
  a result, after a proper configuration, subscribers now correctly receive
  Mailman forwarded messages in this scenario. (BZ#1229288)

  * Previously, the /etc/mailman file had incorrectly set permissions, which
  in some cases caused removing Mailman lists to fail with a "'NoneType'
  object has no attribute 'close'" message. With this update, the permissions
  value for /etc/mailman is correctly set to 2775 instead of 0755, and
  removing Mailman lists now works as expected. (BZ#1229307)

  * Prior to this update, the mailman utility incorrectly installed the
  tmpfiles configuration in the /etc/tmpfiles.d/ directory. As a consequence,
  changes made to mailman tmpfiles configuration were overwritten if the
  mailman packages were reinstalled or updated. The mailman utility now
  installs the tmpfiles configuration in the /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ directory,
  and changes made to them by the user are preserved on reinstall or update.
  (BZ#1229306)

  All mailman users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
