  - CVE-2011-1018
summary: |
  An updated logwatch package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Logwatch is a customizable log analysis system. Logwatch parses through
  your system's logs for a given period of time and creates a report
  analyzing areas that you specify, in as much detail as you require.

  A flaw was found in the way Logwatch processed log files. If an attacker
  were able to create a log file with a malicious file name, it could result
  in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the root user when that
  log file is analyzed by Logwatch. (CVE-2011-1018)

  Users of logwatch should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
