  - CVE-2014-0136
summary: |
  Updated cfme packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
  available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
  automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual
  environments. CloudForms Management Engine is built on Ruby on Rails, a
  model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.
  Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.

  It was found that the get and log methods of the AgentController wrote log
  messages without sanitizing user input. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to insert arbitrary content into the log files written to by
  AgentController. (CVE-2014-0136)

  This issue was discovered by Jan Rusnacko of Red Hat Product Security.

  This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  All users of Red Hat CloudForms 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
