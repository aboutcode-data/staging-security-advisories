aliases:
  - CVE-2009-2855
  - CVE-2010-0308
summary: |
  An updated squid package that fixes two security issues and several bugs is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
  supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  A flaw was found in the way Squid processed certain external ACL helper
  HTTP header fields that contained a delimiter that was not a comma. A
  remote attacker could issue a crafted request to the Squid server, causing
  excessive CPU use (up to 100%). (CVE-2009-2855)

  Note: The CVE-2009-2855 issue only affected non-default configurations that
  use an external ACL helper script.

  A flaw was found in the way Squid handled truncated DNS replies. A remote
  attacker able to send specially-crafted UDP packets to Squid's DNS client
  port could trigger an assertion failure in Squid's child process, causing
  that child process to exit. (CVE-2010-0308)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Squid's init script returns a non-zero value when trying to stop a
  stopped service. This is not LSB compliant and can generate difficulties in
  cluster environments. This update makes stopping LSB compliant. (BZ#521926)

  * Squid is not currently built to support MAC address filtering in ACLs.
  This update includes support for MAC address filtering. (BZ#496170)

  * Squid is not currently built to support Kerberos negotiate
  authentication. This update enables Kerberos authentication. (BZ#516245)

  * Squid does not include the port number as part of URIs it constructs when
  configured as an accelerator. This results in a 403 error. This update
  corrects this behavior. (BZ#538738)

  * the error_map feature does not work if the same handling is set also on
  the HTTP server that operates in deflate mode. This update fixes this
  issue. (BZ#470843)

  All users of squid should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves
  these issues. After installing this update, the squid service will be
  restarted automatically.
