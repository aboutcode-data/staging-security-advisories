  - CVE-2014-7960
summary: |
  Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
  containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
  data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
  redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
  replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
  consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
  deployment.

  A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in OpenStack Object Storage
  (swift). By adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user
  could bypass the max_meta_count constraint, and store more metadata than
  allowed by the configuration. (CVE-2014-7960)

  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
  OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.
