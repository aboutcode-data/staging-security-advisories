  - CVE-2002-0651
summary: "Various versions of the ISC BIND resolver libraries are vulnerable to a\nbuffer overflow\
  \ attack.  Updated BIND packages are now available to fix\nthis issue.\n\nISC BIND (Berkeley\
  \ Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS\n(Domain Name System) protocols. BIND\
  \ includes a DNS server (named),\nwhich resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library\n\
  (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\nvarious tools.\n \nA buffer\
  \ overflow vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of DNS\nresolver libraries.  Applications\
  \ that utilize vulnerable DNS resolver\nlibraries may be affected.  A remote attacker who\
  \ is able to send malicious\nDNS responses could potentially exploit this vulnerability to\
  \ execute\narbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. \n\nRed Hat\
  \ Linux does not ship with any applications or libraries that link \nagainst the BIND resolver\
  \ libraries; however, third party code may be affected.\n\nThe updated bind packages included\
  \ in this errata contain the patches from\n8.3.3 which fix the buffer overflow applied (backported)\
  \ to the 9.2.1 sources."
