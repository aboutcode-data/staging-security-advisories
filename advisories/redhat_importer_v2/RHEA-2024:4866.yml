  - CVE-2024-34156
summary: |
  This is release 1.4 of the rpms for Red Hat Service Interconnect. Red Hat Service Interconnect 1.4 introduces a service network, linking TCP and HTTP services across the hybrid cloud.
  A service network enables communication between services running in different network locations or sites. It allows geographically distributed services to connect as if they were all running in the same site.

  As a Kubernetes user, I cannot connect easily connect services from one cluster with services on another cluster. Red Hat Application Interconnect enables me to create a service network and it allows geographically distributed services to connect as if they were all running in the same site.
