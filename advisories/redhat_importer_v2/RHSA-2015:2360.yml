  - CVE-2015-3258
  - CVE-2015-3279
summary: |
  Updated cups-filters packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
  and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The cups-filters packages contain back ends, filters, and other software
  that was once part of the core Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS)
  distribution but is now maintained independently.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw and an integer overflow flaw leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow were discovered in the way the texttopdf utility
  of cups-filter processed print jobs with a specially crafted line size.
  An attacker able to submit print jobs could use these flaws to crash
  texttopdf or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  "lp" user. (CVE-2015-3258, CVE-2015-3279)

  The CVE-2015-3258 issue was discovered by Petr Sklenar of Red Hat.

  Notably, this update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, when polling CUPS printers from a CUPS server, when a printer
  name contained an underscore (_), the client displayed the name containing
  a hyphen (-) instead. This made the print queue unavailable. With this
  update, CUPS allows the underscore character in printer names, and printers
  appear as shown on the CUPS server as expected. (BZ#1167408)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * Now, the information from local and remote CUPS servers is cached during
  each poll, and the CUPS server load is reduced. (BZ#1191691)

  All cups-filters users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement.
