  - CVE-2014-3497
summary: |
  Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse)
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) provides object storage in virtual
  containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
  data).

  It was found that Swift did not escape all HTTP header values, allowing
  data to be injected into the responses sent from the Swift server. This
  could lead to cross-site scripting attacks (and possibly other impacts) if
  a user were tricked into clicking on a malicious URL. (CVE-2014-3497)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges the Globo.com Security Team as the original reporter.

  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
  OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.
