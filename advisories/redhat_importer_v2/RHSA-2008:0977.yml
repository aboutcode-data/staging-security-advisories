summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2008-0017, CVE-2008-5013, CVE-2008-5014, CVE-2008-5016,
  CVE-2008-5017, CVE-2008-5018, CVE-2008-5019, CVE-2008-5021)

  Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. A web
  site containing specially-crafted content could potentially trick a
  SeaMonkey user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-5012,
  CVE-2008-5022, CVE-2008-5023, CVE-2008-5024)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
