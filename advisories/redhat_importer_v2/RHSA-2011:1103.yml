  - CVE-2011-2692
summary: |
  Updated libpng and libpng10 packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
  manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

  An uninitialized memory read issue was found in the way libpng processed
  certain PNG images that use the Physical Scale (sCAL) extension. An
  attacker could create a specially-crafted PNG image that, when opened,
  could cause an application using libpng to crash. (CVE-2011-2692)

  Users of libpng and libpng10 should upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running
  applications using libpng or libpng10 must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
