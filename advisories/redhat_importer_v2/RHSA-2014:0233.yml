  - CVE-2014-0071
summary: |
  Updated openstack-packstack packages that fix one security issue and
  multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
  Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  PackStack is a command-line utility that uses Puppet modules to support
  rapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection.
  PackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof-of-concept
  installations and more complex multi-node installations.

  It was found that PackStack did not correctly install the rules defined in
  the default security groups when deployed on OpenStack Networking
  (neutron), allowing network connections to be made to systems that should
  not have been accessible. (CVE-2014-0071)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, swift's object versioning was disabled by default. With this
  update, this feature is now enabled in the default configuration file
  ('allow_versions "true"' in /etc/swift/container-server.conf). (BZ#967308)

  * Previously, it was not possible to run neutron with Open vSwitch using
  Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN). This update adds support for VXLAN in
  neutron. (BZ#1021778)

  * PackStack failed to complete the deployment of OpenStack due to the
  MongoDB service (mongod) being terminated by systemd. This was because
  mongod, when first started, exceeded the timeout value set by systemd.
  With this update, mongod uses small files when it is initially started, and
  no longer exceeds systemd's timeout value. (BZ#1036207)

  * Previously, services for OpenStack Compute and other OpenStack components
  ran in debug mode by default. With this update, the CONFIG_DEBUG_MODE
  configuration parameter has been added. When this parameter is set to 'y',
  all OpenStack services will run in debug mode. By default, debug mode is
  disabled. (BZ#1048041)

  Note: Currently, PackStack does not support deployment of the ML2 Neutron
  plug-in. The ML2 plug-in can be used in manual configurations, or by
  deploying initially with the Open vSwitch plug-in using PackStack and
  converting the installation to use ML2. This method is described at
  http://openstack.redhat.com/Modular_Layer_2_%28ML2%29_Plugin. The progress
  on fixing this bug can be followed in Red Hat Bugzilla bug 1017144.

  All openstack-packstack users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
