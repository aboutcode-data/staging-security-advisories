  - CVE-2012-5629
summary: |
  Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 packages that fix
  one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
  which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam.

  When using LDAP authentication with the provided LDAP login modules
  (LdapLoginModule/LdapExtLoginModule), empty passwords were allowed by
  default. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended authentication
  by providing an empty password for a valid username, as the LDAP server may
  recognize this as an 'unauthenticated authentication' (RFC 4513). This
  update sets the allowEmptyPasswords option for the LDAP login modules to
  false if the option is not already configured. (CVE-2012-5629)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
  and configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
