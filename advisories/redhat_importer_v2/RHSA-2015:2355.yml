  - CVE-2015-5292
summary: |
  Updated sssd packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service provides a set of
  daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication
  mechanisms.

  It was found that SSSD's Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) responder
  plug-in would leak a small amount of memory on each authentication request.
  A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to exhaust all available
  memory on the system by making repeated requests to a Kerberized daemon
  application configured to authenticate using the PAC responder plug-in.
  (CVE-2015-5292)

  The sssd packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.13.0, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#1205554)

  Several enhancements are described in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2
  Release Notes, linked to in the References section:

  * SSSD smart card support (BZ#854396)
  * Cache authentication in SSSD (BZ#910187)
  * SSSD supports overriding automatically discovered AD site (BZ#1163806)
  * SSSD can now deny SSH access to locked accounts (BZ#1175760)
  * SSSD enables UID and GID mapping on individual clients (BZ#1183747)
  * Background refresh of cached entries (BZ#1199533)
  * Multi-step prompting for one-time and long-term passwords (BZ#1200873)
  * Caching for initgroups operations (BZ#1206575)

  Bugs fixed:

  * When the SELinux user content on an IdM server was set to an empty
  string, the SSSD SELinux evaluation utility returned an error. (BZ#1192314)

  * If the ldap_child process failed to initialize credentials and exited
  with an error multiple times, operations that create files in some cases
  started failing due to an insufficient amount of i-nodes. (BZ#1198477)

  * The SRV queries used a hard coded TTL timeout, and environments that
  wanted the SRV queries to be valid for a certain time only were blocked.
  Now, SSSD parses the TTL value out of the DNS packet. (BZ#1199541)

  * Previously, initgroups operation took an excessive amount of time. Now,
  logins and ID processing are faster for setups with AD back end and
  disabled ID mapping. (BZ#1201840)

  * When an IdM client with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 or later was
  connecting to a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 or earlier,
  authentication with an AD trusted domain caused the sssd_be process to
  terminate unexpectedly. (BZ#1202170)

  * If replication conflict entries appeared during HBAC processing, the user
  was denied access. Now, the replication conflict entries are skipped and
  users are permitted access. (BZ#1202245)

  * The array of SIDs no longer contains an uninitialized value and SSSD no
  longer crashes. (BZ#1204203)

  * SSSD supports GPOs from different domain controllers and no longer
  crashes when processing GPOs from different domain controllers.
  (BZ#1205852)

  * SSSD could not refresh sudo rules that contained groups with special
  characters, such as parentheses, in their name. (BZ#1208507)

  * The IPA names are not qualified on the client side if the server already
  qualified them, and IdM group members resolve even if default_domain_suffix
  is used on the server side. (BZ#1211830)

  * The internal cache cleanup task has been disabled by default to improve
  performance of the sssd_be process. (BZ#1212489)

  * Now, default_domain_suffix is not considered anymore for autofs maps.
  (BZ#1216285)

  * The user can set subdomain_inherit=ignore_group-members to disable
  fetching group members for trusted domains. (BZ#1217350)

  * The group resolution failed with an error message: "Error: 14 (Bad
  address)". The binary GUID handling has been fixed. (BZ#1226119)

  Enhancements added:

  * The description of default_domain_suffix has been improved in the manual
  pages. (BZ#1185536)

  * With the new "%0" template option, users on SSSD IdM clients can now use
  home directories set on AD. (BZ#1187103)

  All sssd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements.
