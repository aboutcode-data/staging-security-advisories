  - CVE-2016-8745
summary: "An update for tomcat is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for\
  \ each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nApache Tomcat is a\
  \ servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.\n\nSecurity\
  \ Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted\
  \ invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted\
  \ the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP\
  \ response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform\
  \ an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816)\n\
  \nNote: This fix causes Tomcat to respond with an HTTP 400 Bad Request error when request\
  \ contains characters that are not permitted by the HTTP specification to appear not encoded,\
  \ even though they were previously accepted. The newly introduced system property tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.requestTargetAllow\
  \ can be used to configure Tomcat to accept curly braces ({ and }) and the pipe symbol (|)\
  \ in not encoded form, as these are often used in URLs without being properly encoded. \n\n\
  * A bug was discovered in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector.\
  \ This led to the current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times\
  \ allowing information leakage between requests including, and not limited to, session ID\
  \ and the response body. (CVE-2016-8745)"
