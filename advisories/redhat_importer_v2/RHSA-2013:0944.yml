  - CVE-2013-2104
summary: |
  Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue and
  multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly)
  Preview.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Python-keystoneclient is the client library and command line utility for
  interacting with the OpenStack identity API.

  A flaw in Keystone allowed an attacker with access to the web and network
  interfaces of services utilizing python-keystoneclient (such as Nova,
  Cinder, Swift, Glance, and so on) to continue using PKI tokens that had
  expired. This would allow the attacker to continue using the PKI tokens
  despite the PKI tokens being expired, giving them continued access to
  OpenStack services. (CVE-2013-2104)

  This issue was discovered by Eoghan Glynn of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes a number of bugs in python-keystoneclient.

  All users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview are advised to install
  these updated packages.
