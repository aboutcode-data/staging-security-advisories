summary: |
  An updated openshift-origin-node-util package that fixes two security
  issues is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openshift-origin-node-util package provides a set of utility scripts
  for a node. Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing
  Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private
  cloud deployments.

  A flaw was found in the way the administrative web interface for restoring
  applications (restorer.php) processed options passed to it. A remote
  attacker could send a specially-crafted request to restorer.php that would
  result in the query string being parsed as command line options and
  arguments. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges
  of an arbitrary application. (CVE-2012-5646)

  An open redirect flaw was found in restorer.php. A remote attacker able to
  trick a victim into opening the restorer.php page using a specially-crafted
  link could redirect the victim to an arbitrary page. (CVE-2012-5647)

  These issues were discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat Regional IT
  team.

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise are advised to upgrade to this
  updated package, which corrects these issues.
