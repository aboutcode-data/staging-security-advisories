  - CVE-2009-0217
summary: |
  Updated xmlsec1 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The XML Security Library is a C library based on libxml2 and OpenSSL. It
  implements the XML Signature Syntax and Processing and XML Encryption
  Syntax and Processing standards. HMAC is used for message authentication
  using cryptographic hash functions. The HMAC algorithm allows the hash
  output to be truncated (as documented in RFC 2104).

  A missing check for the recommended minimum length of the truncated form of
  HMAC-based XML signatures was found in xmlsec1. An attacker could use this
  flaw to create a specially-crafted XML file that forges an XML signature,
  allowing the attacker to bypass authentication that is based on the XML
  Signature specification. (CVE-2009-0217)

  Users of xmlsec1 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
  packages, applications that use the XML Security Library must be restarted
  for the update to take effect.
