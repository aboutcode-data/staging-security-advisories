  - CVE-2006-0301
summary: |
  An updated xpdf package that fixes a buffer overflow security issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The xpdf package is an X Window System-based viewer for Portable Document
  Format (PDF) files.

  A heap based buffer overflow bug was discovered in Xpdf. An attacker could
  construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause Xpdf to crash or
  possibly execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0301 to this issue.

  Users of Xpdf should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve these issues.

  Red Hat would like to thank Dirk Mueller for reporting this issue and
  providing a patch.
