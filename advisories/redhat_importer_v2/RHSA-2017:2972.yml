aliases:
  - CVE-2017-12171
  - CVE-2017-9798
summary: |
  An update for httpd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way httpd handled invalid and previously unregistered HTTP methods specified in the Limit directive used in an .htaccess file. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the server memory, or cause httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2017-9798)

  * A regression was found in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 version of httpd, causing comments in the "Allow" and "Deny" configuration lines to be parsed incorrectly. A web administrator could unintentionally allow any client to access a restricted HTTP resource. (CVE-2017-12171)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hanno Böck for reporting CVE-2017-9798 and KAWAHARA Masashi for reporting CVE-2017-12171.
