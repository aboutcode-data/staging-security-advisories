  - CVE-2016-4470
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's keyring handling code, where in key_reject_and_link() an uninitialized variable would eventually lead to arbitrary free address which could allow attacker to use a use-after-free style attack. (CVE-2016-4470, Important)

  This issue was discovered by David Howells (Red Hat Inc.).

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, the BUG_ON() signal appeared in the fs_clear_inode() function where the nfs_have_writebacks() function reported a positive value for nfs_inode->npages. As a consequence, a kernel panic occurred. This update performs a serialization by holding the inode i_lock over the check of PagePrivate and locking the request, which fixes this bug. (BZ#1365161)
