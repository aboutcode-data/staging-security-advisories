  - CVE-2015-3246
summary: |
  Updated libuser packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The libuser library implements a standardized interface for manipulating
  and administering user and group accounts. Sample applications that are
  modeled after applications from the shadow password suite (shadow-utils)
  are included in these packages.

  Two flaws were found in the way the libuser library handled the /etc/passwd
  file. A local attacker could use an application compiled against libuser
  (for example, userhelper) to manipulate the /etc/passwd file, which could
  result in a denial of service or possibly allow the attacker to escalate
  their privileges to root. (CVE-2015-3245, CVE-2015-3246)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qualys for reporting these issues.

  All libuser users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
