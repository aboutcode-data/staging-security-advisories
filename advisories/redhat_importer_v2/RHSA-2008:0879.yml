summary: |
  An updated firefox package that fixes various security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2008-4058, CVE-2008-4060, CVE-2008-4061, CVE-2008-4062,
  CVE-2008-4063, CVE-2008-4064)

  Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was displayed. A
  web page containing specially crafted content could potentially trick a
  Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-4067,
  CVE-2008-4068)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handles mouse click events. A web page
  containing specially crafted JavaScript code could move the content window
  while a mouse-button was pressed, causing any item under the pointer to be
  dragged. This could, potentially, cause the user to perform an unsafe
  drag-and-drop action. (CVE-2008-3837)

  A flaw was found in Firefox that caused certain characters to be stripped
  from JavaScript code. This flaw could allow malicious JavaScript to bypass
  or evade script filters. (CVE-2008-4065)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
  security advisories for Firefox 3.0.2. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section.

  All firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches that correct these issues.
