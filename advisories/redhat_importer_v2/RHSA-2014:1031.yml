  - CVE-2014-3562
summary: |
  Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  It was found that when replication was enabled for each attribute in 389
  Directory Server, which is the default configuration, the server returned
  replicated metadata when the directory was searched while debugging was
  enabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to disclose potentially
  sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3562)

  This issue was discovered by Ludwig Krispenz of Red Hat.

  All 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically.
