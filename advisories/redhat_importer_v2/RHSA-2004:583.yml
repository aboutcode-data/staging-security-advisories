summary: |
  An updated nfs-utils package that fixes various security issues is now
  available.

  The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
  related tools, providing a much higher level of performance than the
  traditional Linux NFS server used by most users.

  This package also contains the showmount program. Showmount queries
  the mount daemon on a remote host for information about the NFS
  (Network File System) server on the remote host.

  SGI reported that the statd daemon did not properly handle the SIGPIPE
  signal.  A misconfigured or malicious peer could cause statd to crash,
  leading to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1014 to this issue.

  Arjan van de Ven discovered a buffer overflow in rquotad.  On 64-bit
  architectures, an improper integer conversion can lead to a buffer
  overflow.  An attacker with access to an NFS share could send a specially
  crafted request which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0946 to this issue.

  Additionally, this updated package addresses the following issues:

  - The UID of the nfsnobody account has been fixed for 32-bit and 64-bit
  machines. Because the st_uid field of the stat structure is an unsigned
  integer, an actual value of -2 cannot be used when creating the account, so
  the decimal value of -2 is used. On a 32-bit machine, the decimal value of
  -2 is 65534 but on a 64-bit machine it is 4294967294. This errata enables
  the nfs-utils post-install script to detect the target architecture, so an
  appropriate decimal value is used.

  All users of nfs-utils should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues.
