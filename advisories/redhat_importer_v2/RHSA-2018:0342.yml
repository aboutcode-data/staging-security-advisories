summary: |
  An update for rh-maven35-jackson-databind is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The jackson-databind package provides general data-binding functionality for Jackson, which works on top of Jackson core streaming API.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. (CVE-2017-7525)

  * Further classes that an attacker could use to achieve code execution through deserialisation were discovered, and added to the blacklist introduced by CVE-2017-7525. (CVE-2017-15095, CVE-2017-17485)

  Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-15095 and 0c0c0f from 360观星实验室 for reporting CVE-2017-17485.
