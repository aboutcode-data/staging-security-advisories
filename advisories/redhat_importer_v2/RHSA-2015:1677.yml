  - CVE-2015-1852
summary: |
  Updated python-keystoneclient and python-keystonemiddleware packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Python-keystonemiddleware (formely python-keystoneclient) is a client library and a command line utility for interacting with the OpenStack Identity API.

  Red Hat Enterprise OpenStack Platform 6.0 contains and uses both the
  python-keystonemiddleware and python-keystoneclient versions of this
  package.

  It was discovered that some items in the the S3Token configuration as used
  by python-keystonemiddleware and python-keystoneclient were incorrectly
  evaluated as strings, an issue similar to CVE-2014-7144.  This would result
  in a setting for 'insecure=false' to evaluate as true and leave TLS
  connections open to MITM. (CVE-2015-1852)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original reporter.

  Note: "insecure" defaults to false, so setups that do not specifically define "insecure=false" are unaffected.

  All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
