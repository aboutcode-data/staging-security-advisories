  - CVE-2013-1914
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
  Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without
  these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  It was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory
  used during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application
  resolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause
  the application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)

  A flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process
  multibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular
  expression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted
  input that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2013-0242)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The improvements RHSA-2012:1207 made to the accuracy of floating point
  functions in the math library caused performance regressions for those
  functions. The performance regressions were analyzed and a fix was applied
  that retains the current accuracy but reduces the performance penalty to
  acceptable levels. Refer to Red Hat Knowledge solution 229993, linked
  to in the References, for further information. (BZ#950535)

  * It was possible that a memory location freed by the localization code
  could be accessed immediately after, resulting in a crash. The fix ensures
  that the application does not crash by avoiding the invalid memory access.
  (BZ#951493)

  Users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
