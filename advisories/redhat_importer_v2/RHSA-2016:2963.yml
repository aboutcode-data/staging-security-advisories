  An update for xen is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Xen is a virtual machine monitor

  Security Fix(es):

  * An out of bounds array access issue was found in the Xen virtual machine monitor, built with the QEMU ioport support. It could occur while doing ioport read/write operations, if guest was to supply a 32bit address parameter. A privileged guest user/process could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges on a host. (CVE-2016-9637)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.
