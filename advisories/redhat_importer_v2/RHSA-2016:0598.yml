summary: |
  A jboss-ec2-eap update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.7 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  The jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). With this update, the packages have been updated to ensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.7.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A read-timeout flaw was found in the HTTPS NIO Connector handling of SSL handshakes. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could create a socket and cause a thread to remain occupied indefinitely so long as the socket remained open (denial of service). (CVE-2016-2094)

  * It was found that Tomcat would keep connections open after processing requests with a large enough request body. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to exhaust the pool of available connections and preventing further, legitimate connections to the Tomcat server to be made. (CVE-2014-0230)

  The CVE-2016-2094 issue was discovered by Aaron Ogburn of Red Hat.
