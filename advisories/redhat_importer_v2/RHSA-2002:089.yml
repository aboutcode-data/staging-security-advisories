  - CVE-2002-0378
summary: "The LPRng print spooler, as shipped in Red Hat Linux 7.x, accepts all\nremote print\
  \ jobs by default.\n\nWith its default configuration, LPRng will accept job submissions from\n\
  any host, which is not appropriate in a workstation environment.  We\nare grateful to Matthew\
  \ Caron for pointing out this configuration\nproblem.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0378 to this issue.\n\nThe updated\
  \ packages from this advisory change the job submission\npolicy (in /etc/lpd.perms) so that\
  \ jobs from remote hosts are refused\nby default.\n\nThose running print servers may want\
  \ to adjust this policy as\nappropriate, for example to give access to certain hosts or subnets.\n\
  For details on how to do this see the lpd.perms(5) man page.\n\nSince Red Hat Linux 7.1, default\
  \ installations include ipchains rules\nblocking remote access to the print spooler IP port;\
  \ as a result those\ninstallations already reject remote job submissions.  However, Red Hat\n\
  Linux 7 machines and any machine upgraded to a later release (as \nopposed to\nhaving been\
  \ freshly installed) will not have ipchains rules in place\nby default.\n\nIMPORTANT: There\
  \ are special instructions for installing this update at\nthe end of the \"Solution\" section\
  \ below."
