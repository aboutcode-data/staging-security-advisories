summary: "An updated gzip package is now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nThe gzip package contains\
  \ the GNU gzip data compression program.\n\nA bug was found in the way zgrep processes file\
  \ names. If a user can be\ntricked into running zgrep on a file with a carefully crafted file\
  \ name,\narbitrary commands could be executed as the user running zgrep. The Common\nVulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0758 to this issue.\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way gunzip modifies permissions of files being\ndecompressed. A local\
  \ attacker with write permissions in the directory in\nwhich a victim is decompressing a file\
  \ could remove the file being written\nand replace it with a hard link to a different file\
  \ owned by the victim. \ngunzip then gives the linked file the permissions of the uncompressed\
  \ file.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the\
  \ name CAN-2005-0988 to this issue.\n\nA directory traversal bug was found in the way gunzip\
  \ processes the -N\nflag. If a victim decompresses a file with the -N flag, gunzip fails to\n\
  sanitize the path which could result in a file owned by the victim being\noverwritten. The\
  \ Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1228\
  \ to this issue.\n\nUsers of gzip should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\n\
  backported patches to correct these issues."
