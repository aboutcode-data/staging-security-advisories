summary: |
  JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.3, which fixes multiple security issues
  and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The JBoss Communications Platform (JBCP) is an open source VoIP platform
  certified for JAIN SLEE 1.1 and SIP Servlets 1.1 compliance. JBCP serves as
  a high performance core for Service Delivery Platforms (SDPs) and IP
  Multimedia Subsystems (IMSs) by leveraging J2EE to enable the convergence
  of data and video in Next-Generation Intelligent Network (NGIN)
  applications.

  This JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.3 release serves as a replacement
  for JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.2, and includes various bug fixes.
  Refer to the JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.3 Release Notes for
  information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes
  will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  A flaw was found in the way JBoss Web handled UTF-8 surrogate pair
  characters. If JBoss Web was hosting an application with UTF-8 character
  encoding enabled, or that included user-supplied UTF-8 strings in a
  response, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service (infinite loop) on the JBoss Web server. (CVE-2011-4610)

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was
  susceptible to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to cause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by
  sending an HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map
  to the same hash value. This update introduces a limit on the number of
  parameters and headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The
  default limit is 512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults
  can be changed by setting the
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "server/$PROFILE/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2011-4858)

  It was found that JBoss Web did not handle large numbers of parameters and
  large parameter values efficiently. A remote attacker could make a JBoss
  Web server use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP request
  containing a large number of parameters or large parameter values. This
  update introduces limits on the number of parameters and headers processed
  per request to address this issue. Refer to the CVE-2011-4858 description
  for information about the org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT
  and org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties.
  (CVE-2012-0022)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way JBoss Web handled HTTP DIGEST
  authentication. These flaws weakened the JBoss Web HTTP DIGEST
  authentication implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of
  HTTP BASIC authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to
  perform session replay attacks. (CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-5062,
  CVE-2011-5063, CVE-2011-5064)

  A flaw was found in the way JBoss Web handled sendfile request
  attributes when using the HTTP APR (Apache Portable Runtime) or NIO
  (Non-Blocking I/O) connector. A malicious web application running on a
  JBoss Web instance could use this flaw to bypass security manager
  restrictions and gain access to files it would otherwise be unable to
  access, or possibly terminate the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  (CVE-2011-2526)

  Red Hat would like to thank NTT OSSC for reporting CVE-2011-4610; oCERT for
  reporting CVE-2011-4858; and the Apache Tomcat project for reporting
  CVE-2011-2526. oCERT acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the
  original reporters of CVE-2011-4858.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss
  Communications Platform installation (including its databases,
  applications, configuration files, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.2 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Communications Platform
  5.1.3.
