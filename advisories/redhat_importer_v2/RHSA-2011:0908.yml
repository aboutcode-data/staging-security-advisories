summary: |
  Updated ruby packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  A flaw was found in the way large amounts of memory were allocated on
  64-bit systems when using the BigDecimal class. A context-dependent
  attacker could use this flaw to cause memory corruption, causing a Ruby
  application that uses the BigDecimal class to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. This issue did not affect 32-bit systems. (CVE-2011-0188)

  It was found that WEBrick (the Ruby HTTP server toolkit) did not filter
  terminal escape sequences from its log files. A remote attacker could use
  specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject terminal escape sequences into
  the WEBrick log files. If a victim viewed the log files with a terminal
  emulator, it could result in control characters being executed with the
  privileges of that user. (CVE-2009-4492)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way WEBrick displayed
  error pages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a cross-site
  scripting attack against victims by tricking them into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL. (CVE-2010-0541)

  A flaw was found in the method for translating an exception message into a
  string in the Exception class. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  bypass safe level 4 restrictions, allowing untrusted (tainted) code to
  modify arbitrary, trusted (untainted) strings, which safe level 4
  restrictions would otherwise prevent. (CVE-2011-1005)

  Red Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of Apple Product Security for
  reporting the CVE-2011-0188 and CVE-2010-0541 issues.

  All Ruby users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
