summary: |
  Updated wireshark packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was
  previously known as Ethereal.

  An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the Wireshark SMB and SMB2
  dissectors. If Wireshark read a malformed packet off a network or opened a
  malicious dump file, it could crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as
  the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2009-4377)

  Several buffer overflow flaws were found in the Wireshark LWRES dissector.
  If Wireshark read a malformed packet off a network or opened a malicious
  dump file, it could crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user
  running Wireshark. (CVE-2010-0304)

  Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
  crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
  opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2009-2560, CVE-2009-2562, CVE-2009-2563,
  CVE-2009-3550, CVE-2009-3829)

  Users of Wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Wireshark version 1.0.11, and resolve these issues. All running instances
  of Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.
