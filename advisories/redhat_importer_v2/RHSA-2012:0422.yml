summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes two security issues and one
  bug is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor
  implementation emulated the syscall instruction for 32-bit guests. An
  unprivileged guest user could trigger this flaw to crash the guest.
  (CVE-2012-0045)

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the Linux kernel's igmp_heard_query()
  function. An attacker able to send certain IGMP (Internet Group Management
  Protocol) packets to a target system could use this flaw to cause a denial
  of service. (CVE-2012-0207)

  Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Bärwolf for reporting CVE-2012-0045,
  and Simon McVittie for reporting CVE-2012-0207.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2011-4077, CVE-2011-4081, CVE-2011-4132, CVE-2011-4347, CVE-2011-4594,
  CVE-2011-4611, CVE-2011-4622 and CVE-2012-0038 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2012-0444 (libvorbis issue)

  CVE-2012-0841 (libxml2 issue)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The rhev-hypervisor5 and rhev-hypervisor6 packages sometimes updated the
  symbolic links in the /usr/share/rhev-hypervisor/ directory with incorrect
  targets. The packages have been updated, they now always update the
  symbolic links with the correct targets. (BZ#784706)

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.
