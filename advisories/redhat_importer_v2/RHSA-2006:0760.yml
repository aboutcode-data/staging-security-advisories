summary: "Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and\
  \ newsgroup client.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain malformed\n\
  Javascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of\nJavascript code in such\
  \ a way that could cause Thunderbird to crash or\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running\
  \ Thunderbird.  JavaScript support\nis disabled by default in Thunderbird; this issue is not\
  \ exploitable\nwithout enabling JavaScript. (CVE-2006-6498, CVE-2006-6501, CVE-2006-6502,\n\
  CVE-2006-6503, CVE-2006-6504)\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird renders web\
  \ pages. A\nmalicious web page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute\narbitrary\
  \ code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-6497)\n\nA heap based buffer overflow flaw\
  \ was found in the way Thunderbird parses\nthe Content-Type mail header. A malicious mail\
  \ message could cause the\nThunderbird client to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code\
  \ as the user\nrunning Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-6505) \n\nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to\
  \ apply this update, which contains\nThunderbird version 1.5.0.9 that corrects these issues."
