summary: "An update for unbound is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update\
  \ Support.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of\
  \ Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References\
  \ section.\n\nThe unbound packages provide a validating, recursive, and caching DNS or DNSSEC\
  \ resolver. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* bind9: KeyTrap - Extreme CPU consumption in DNSSEC\
  \ validator (CVE-2023-50387)\n\n* bind9: Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust\
  \ CPU resources (CVE-2023-50868)\n\n* A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect\
  \ default permissions,\nallowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound\
  \ runtime\nconfiguration. The default combination of the \"control-use-cert: no\" option with\n\
  either explicit or implicit use of an IP address in the \"control-interface\"\noption could\
  \ allow improper access. If a process can connect over localhost to\nport 8953, it can alter\
  \ the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows\nan unprivileged local process to\
  \ manipulate a running instance, potentially\naltering forwarders, allowing them to track\
  \ all queries forwarded by the local\nresolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.\n\
  \nTo mitigate the vulnerability, a new file\n\"/etc/unbound/conf.d/remote-control.conf\" has\
  \ been added and included in the\nmain unbound configuration file, \"unbound.conf\". The file\
  \ contains two\ndirectives that should limit access to unbound.conf:\n\n    control-interface:\
  \ \"/run/unbound/control\"\n    control-use-cert: \"yes\"\n\nFor details about these directives,\
  \ run \"man unbound.conf\".\n\nUpdating to the version of unbound provided by this advisory\
  \ should, in most\ncases, address the vulnerability. To verify that your configuration is\
  \ not\nvulnerable, use the \"unbound-control status | grep control\" command. If the\noutput\
  \ contains \"control(ssl)\" or \"control(namedpipe)\", your configuration is\nnot vulnerable.\
  \ If the command output returns only \"control\", the configuration\nis vulnerable because\
  \ it does not enforce access only to the unbound group\nmembers. To fix your configuration,\
  \ add the line \"include:\n/etc/unbound/conf.d/remote-control.conf\" to the end of the file\n\
  \"/etc/unbound/unbound.conf\". If you use a custom\n\"/etc/unbound/conf.d/remote-control.conf\"\
  \ file, add the new directives to this\nfile. (CVE-2024-1488)\n\nFor more details about the\
  \ security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, acknowledgments, and other related\
  \ information, refer to the CVE page(s)\nlisted in the References section."
