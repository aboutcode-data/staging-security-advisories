summary: "An update is now available for Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.5.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  Red Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP) 4.5 consists of three main components:\n\n* Core\
  \ - development and management of apps occurs in the RHMAP Core, which can be installed either\
  \ in an on-premise installation of OpenShift Container Platform 3.x.\n\n* MBaaS - Application\
  \ data, runtimes, and integrations are deployed to the RHMAP MBaaS installed on OpenShift\
  \ Container Platform 3.x.\n\n* Build Farm - deployed separately from the Core and the MBaaS,\
  \ the Build Farm is shared between all instances of RHMAP. Third-party Linux, Windows, and\
  \ Apple server hosting providers are used to support building client app binaries for all\
  \ platforms.\n\nThe Core and MBaaS in RHMAP 4.5 are built on top of OpenShift Container Platform\
  \ 3.x, Kubernetes, Docker, and Red Hat Software Collections. The Core and MBaaS both consist\
  \ of several components, each running in its own container. Similarly, every cloud app deployed\
  \ to the MBaaS runs in a container. Those containers are deployed and orchestrated by Kubernetes.\n\
  \nThis release includes the option of provisioning a self-managed Build Farm on your infrastructure,\
  \ to build Client Apps without relying on hosted Build Farm. For prerequisites and installation\
  \ instructions, see the Installing RHMAP guide.\n\nFor this RHMAP release, the Docker-formatted\
  \ container images required to run the Core and MBaaS inside OpenShift Container Platform\
  \ 3.x are:\n\nrhmap45/fh-aaa:1.0.5-12\nrhmap45/fh-appstore:2.0.3-12\nrhmap45/fh-mbaas:5.8.1-1\
  \ \nrhmap45/fh-messaging:3.0.9-2\nrhmap45/fh-metrics:3.0.7-2\nrhmap45/fh-ngui:5.11.5-2\nrhmap45/fh-scm:1.0.8-3\n\
  rhmap45/fh-statsd:2.0.4-14\nrhmap45/fh-supercore:4.22.0-3\nrhmap45/fh-sdks:1.0.0-30\nrhmap45/gitlab-shell:2.1.2-8\n\
  rhmap45/httpd:2.4-38\nrhmap45/memcached:1.4.15-26\nrhmap45/millicore:7.49.1-1\nrhmap45/mongodb:3.2-29\n\

  \ \nrhmap45/wildcard-proxy:1.0.0-12\nrhmap45/gitlab-migrate:1.0.0-9\nrhmap45/installer:1.0.0-23\n\
  \nThis release serves as an update for Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.4.3. It includes\
  \ bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.5.0 Release\
  \ Notes for information about the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in\
  \ this release.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A shell command injection flaw related to the handling\
  \ of \"ssh\" URLs has been discovered in Git. An attacker could use this flaw to execute shell\
  \ commands with the privileges of the user running the Git client, for example, when performing\
  \ a \"clone\" action on a malicious repository or a legitimate repository containing a malicious\
  \ commit. (CVE-2017-1000117)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the file editor of millicore which\
  \ allows files to be executed as well as created. An attacker could use this flaw to compromise\
  \ other users or teams projects stored in source control management of the RHMAP Core installation.\
  \ (CVE-2017-7552)\n\n* The external_request api call in App Studio (millicore) allows server\
  \ side request forgery (SSRF). An attacker could use this flaw to probe the network internal\
  \ resources and access restricted endpoints. (CVE-2017-7553)\n\n* A flaw was found where the\
  \ App Studio component of RHMAP 4.4 executes javascript provided by a user. An attacker could\
  \ use this flaw to execute a stored XSS attack on an application administrator using App Studio.\
  \ (CVE-2017-7554)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tomas Rzepka for reporting CVE-2017-7552,\
  \ CVE-2017-7553 and CVE-2017-7554."
