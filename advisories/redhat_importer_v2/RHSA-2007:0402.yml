summary: "Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSeaMonkey is an open source Web browser,\
  \ advanced email and newsgroup\nclient, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.\n\nSeveral flaws\
  \ were found in the way SeaMonkey processed certain malformed\nJavaScript code. A web page\
  \ containing malicious JavaScript code could\ncause SeaMonkey to crash or potentially execute\
  \ arbitrary code as\nthe user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2007-2867, CVE-2007-2868)\n\nA flaw\
  \ was found in the way SeaMonkey handled certain FTP PASV commands. A\nmalicious FTP server\
  \ could use this flaw to perform a rudimentary port-scan\nof machines behind a user's firewall.\
  \ (CVE-2007-1562)\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the way SeaMonkey handled\n\
  certain form and cookie data. A malicious web site that is able to set\narbitrary form and\
  \ cookie data could prevent SeaMonkey from\nfunctioning properly. (CVE-2007-1362, CVE-2007-2869)\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey processed certain APOP authentication\nrequests. By\
  \ sending certain responses when SeaMonkey attempted to\nauthenticate against an APOP server,\
  \ a remote attacker could potentially\nacquire certain portions of a user's authentication\
  \ credentials.\n(CVE-2007-1558)\n\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the addEventListener\n\
  JavaScript method. A malicious web site could use this method to access or\nmodify sensitive\
  \ data from another web site. (CVE-2007-2870)\n\nA flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed\
  \ certain web content. A\nmalicious web page could generate content that would overlay user\n\
  interface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking \nusers into thinking\
  \ they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-2871) \n\nUsers of SeaMonkey are advised to\
  \ upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain SeaMonkey version 1.0.9 that corrects\
  \ these issues."
