summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the way the AOL Open System for
  Communication in Realtime (OSCAR) protocol plug-in in Pidgin, used by the
  AOL ICQ and AIM instant messaging systems, escaped certain UTF-8
  characters. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin via a
  specially-crafted OSCAR message. (CVE-2011-4601)

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the way the Pidgin SILC (Secure
  Internet Live Conferencing) protocol plug-in escaped certain UTF-8
  characters in channel messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash Pidgin via a specially-crafted SILC message. (CVE-2011-4603)

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the Jingle extension
  of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) protocol plug-in
  in Pidgin. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash Pidgin via a
  specially-crafted Jingle multimedia message. (CVE-2011-4602)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Boger as the original reporter of
  CVE-2011-4601; Diego Bauche Madero from IOActive as the original reporter
  of CVE-2011-4603; and Thijs Alkemade as the original reporter of
  CVE-2011-4602.

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Pidgin must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
