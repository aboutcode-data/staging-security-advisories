  Bug Fixes:

  * Previously, an empty screen was seen for the topology view of the external mode because in external mode, the nodes are not labelled with the OCS label and hence, the topology view did not show the nodes at the first level.

  With this fix, the topology view is disabled for the external mode clusters and as a result, the confusing empty screen is not displayed. (BZ#2213739)

  * Previously, in MultiCloud Object Gateway (MCG), there was a significant degradation in performance with read and write operations of small objects. The degradation was because the Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) between the MCG endpoint and the core that were required to be cached, missed the cache each time causing an RPC message between the endpoint and the core per each operation.

  With this fix, the lookup in cache is fixed so that the existing data is found and not queried at each operation. (BZ#2215976)

  * Previously, there were repeated crashes of the MultiCloud Object Gateway (MCG) Operator because the operator collided with the updates to the structure when it was trying to print a debug message regarding an internal structure in the MCG Operator.

  With this release, the print is fixed so that there are no collisions, thereby avoiding the repeated crashes of the MCG Operator. (BZ#2216401)

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation are advised to upgrade to these updated images, which provide these bug fixes.
