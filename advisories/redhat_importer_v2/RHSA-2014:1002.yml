  - CVE-2014-3559
summary: |
  Updated rhevm packages that fix one security issue are now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization is a feature-rich server virtualization
  management system that provides advanced capabilities for managing Red Hat
  virtualization infrastructure for Servers and Desktops.

  It was found that the oVirt storage back end did not wipe memory snapshots
  when VMs were deleted, even if wipe-after-delete (WAD) was enabled for the
  VM's disks. A remote attacker with credentials to create a new VM could use
  this flaw to potentially access the contents of memory snapshots in an
  uninitialized storage volume, possibly leading to the disclosure of
  sensitive information. (CVE-2014-3559)

  This issue was discovered by Idan Shaby and Allon Mureinik of Red Hat.

  All rhevm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue.
