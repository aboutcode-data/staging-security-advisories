summary: "A security vulnerability in XChat allows a malicious server to execute\narbitrary\
  \ commands.\n\n[Updated 11 July 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and\
  \ pSeries systems.\n\nXChat is a popular cross-platform IRC client. \n\nVersions of XChat\
  \ prior to 1.8.9 do not filter the response from an IRC\nserver when a \"/dns\" query is executed.\
  \ Because XChat resolves hostnames by\npassing the configured resolver and hostname to a shell,\
  \ an IRC server may\nreturn a maliciously formatted response that executes arbitrary commands\n\
  with the privileges of the user running XChat.\n\nAll users of XChat are advised to update\
  \ to these errata packages\ncontaining XChat version 1.8.9, which is not vulnerable to this\
  \ issue."
