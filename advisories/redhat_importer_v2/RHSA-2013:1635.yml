  - CVE-2013-0281
summary: |
  Updated pacemaker packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Pacemaker is a high-availability cluster resource manager with a powerful
  policy engine.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Pacemaker performed
  authentication and processing of remote connections in certain
  circumstances. When Pacemaker was configured to allow remote Cluster
  Information Base (CIB) configuration or resource management, a remote
  attacker could use this flaw to cause Pacemaker to block indefinitely
  (preventing it from serving other requests). (CVE-2013-0281)

  Note: The default Pacemaker configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has
  the remote CIB management functionality disabled.

  The pacemaker package has been upgraded to upstream version 1.1.10, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version:

  * Pacemaker no longer assumes unknown cman nodes are safely stopped.

  * The core dump file now converts all exit codes into positive 'errno'
  values.

  * Pacemaker ensures a return to a stable state after too many fencing
  failures, and initiates a shutdown if a node claimed to be fenced is still
  active.

  * The crm_error tool adds the ability to list and print error symbols.

  * The crm_resource command allows individual resources to be reprobed, and
  implements the "--ban" option for moving resources away from nodes.
  The "--clear" option has replaced the "--unmove" option. Also, crm_resource
  now supports OCF tracing when using the "--force" option.

  * The IPC mechanism restores the ability for members of the haclient group
  to connect to the cluster.

  * The Policy Engine daemon allows active nodes in the current membership to
  be fenced without quorum.

  * Policy Engine now suppresses meaningless IDs when displaying anonymous
  clone status, supports maintenance mode for a single node, and correctly
  handles the recovered resources before they are operated on.

  * XML configuration files are now checked for non-printing characters and
  replaced with their octal equivalent when exporting XML text. Also, a more
  reliable buffer allocation strategy has been implemented to prevent
  lockups.

  (BZ#987355)

  Additional bug fixes:

  * The "crm_resource --move" command was designed for atomic resources and
  could not handle resources on clones, masters, or slaves present on
  multiple nodes. Consequently, crm_resource could not obtain enough
  information to move a resource and did not perform any action. The "--ban"
  and "--clear" options have been added to allow the administrator to
  instruct the cluster unambiguously. Clone, master, and slave resources can
  now be navigated within the cluster as expected. (BZ#902407)

  * The hacluster user account did not have a user identification (UID) or
  group identification (GID) number reserved on the system. Thus, UID and GID
  values were picked randomly during the installation process. The UID and
  GID number 189 was reserved for hacluster and is now used consistently for
  all installations. (BZ#908450)

  * Certain clusters used node host names that did not match the output of
  the "uname -n" command. Thus, the default node name used by the crm_standby
  and crm_failcount commands was incorrect and caused the cluster to ignore
  the update by the administrator. The crm_node command is now used instead
  of the uname utility in helper scripts. As a result, the cluster behaves as
  expected. (BZ#913093)

  * Due to incorrect return code handling, internal recovery logic of the
  crm_mon utility was not executed when a configuration updated failed to
  apply, leading to an assertion failure. Return codes are now checked
  correctly, and the recovery of an expected error state is now handled
  transparently. (BZ#951371)

  * cman's automatic unfencing feature failed when combined with Pacemaker.
  Support for automated unfencing in Pacemaker has been added, and the
  unwanted behavior no longer occurs. (BZ#996850)

  All pacemaker users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
