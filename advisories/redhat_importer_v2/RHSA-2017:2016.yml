  - CVE-2016-7167
summary: |
  An update for curl is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Multiple integer overflow flaws leading to heap-based buffer overflows were found in the way curl handled escaping and unescaping of data. An attacker could potentially use these flaws to crash an application using libcurl by sending a specially crafted input to the affected libcurl functions. (CVE-2016-7167)

  Additional Changes:

  For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.
