summary: |
  An update for NetworkManager is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  NetworkManager is a system network service that manages network devices and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when available. Its capabilities include managing Ethernet, wireless, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE devices, as well as providing VPN integration with a variety of different VPN services.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: NetworkManager (1.4.0), NetworkManager-libreswan (1.2.4), network-manager-applet (1.4.0), libnl3 (3.2.28). (BZ#1264552, BZ#1296058, BZ#1032717, BZ#1271581)

  Security Fix(es):

  * A race condition vulnerability was discovered in NetworkManager. Temporary files were created insecurely when saving or updating connection settings, which could allow local users to read connection secrets such as VPN passwords or WiFi keys. (CVE-2016-0764)

  Additional Changes:

  For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Release Notes linked from the References section.
