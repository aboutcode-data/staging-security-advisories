  - CVE-2014-3657
summary: |
  Updated libvirt packages that fix two security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
  virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems.
  In addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of
  virtualized systems.

  An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way libvirt's
  qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune() function looked up the disk index in a
  non-persistent (live) disk configuration while a persistent disk
  configuration was being indexed. A remote attacker able to establish a
  read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or,
  potentially, leak memory from the libvirtd process. (CVE-2014-3633)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way libvirt's
  virConnectListAllDomains() function computed the number of used domains.
  A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd
  could use this flaw to make any domain operations within libvirt
  unresponsive. (CVE-2014-3657)

  The CVE-2014-3633 issue was discovered by Luyao Huang of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, libvirt was setting the cpuset.mems parameter for
  domains with numatune/memory[nodeset] prior to starting them. As a
  consequence, domains with such a nodeset, which excluded the NUMA node with
  DMA and DMA32 zones (found in /proc/zoneinfo), could not be started due to
  failed KVM initialization. With this update, libvirt sets the cpuset.mems
  parameter after the initialization, and domains with any nodeset (in
  /numatune/memory) can be started without an error. (BZ#1135871)

  All libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.
