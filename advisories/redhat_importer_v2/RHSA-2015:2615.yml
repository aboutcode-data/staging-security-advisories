summary: "Updated openshift images that fix one security issue are now \navailable for Red Hat\
  \ OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 and 3.1.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Moderate \nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base \nscore, which\
  \ gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the \nCVE link in the References section.\n\
  \nOpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing \nPlatform-as-a-Service\
  \ (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or \nprivate cloud deployments.\n\nIt was found\
  \ that OpenShift's API back end did not verify requests for \npod log locations, allowing\
  \ a pod on a Node to request logs for any \nother pod on that Node. A remote attacker could\
  \ use this flaw to view \nsensitive information via pod logs that they would normally not\
  \ have \naccess to. (CVE-2015-7528)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Jordan Liggitt of Red\
  \ Hat Atomic OpenShift.\n\nTo use the latest 'openshift3/ose:v3.1.0.4' image with the ID \n\
  \"d4caa301790e\" simply run the following command:\n\ndocker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose:v3.1.0.4\n\
  \nand then restart any containers based on this image.\n\nAll OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 and\
  \ 3.1 users are advised to upgrade to \nthese updated images, which correct this issue."
