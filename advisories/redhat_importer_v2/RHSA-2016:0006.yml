summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the LDAP server provided by the AD DC
  in the Samba process daemon. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by
  sending a specially crafted packet, which could cause the server to consume
  an excessive amount of memory and crash. (CVE-2015-7540)

  Multiple buffer over-read flaws were found in the way Samba handled
  malformed inputs in certain encodings. An authenticated, remote attacker
  could possibly use these flaws to disclose portions of the server memory.
  (CVE-2015-5330)

  A man-in-the-middle vulnerability was found in the way "connection signing"
  was implemented by Samba. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  downgrade an existing Samba client connection and force the use of plain
  text. (CVE-2015-5296)

  A missing access control flaw was found in Samba. A remote, authenticated
  attacker could use this flaw to view the current snapshot on a Samba share,
  despite not having DIRECTORY_LIST access rights. (CVE-2015-5299)

  An access flaw was found in the way Samba verified symbolic links when
  creating new files on a Samba share. A remote attacker could exploit this
  flaw to gain access to files outside of Samba's share path. (CVE-2015-5252)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Stefan Metzmacher of the Samba Team and Sernet.de as
  the original reporters of CVE-2015-5296, partha@exablox.com as the original
  reporter of CVE-2015-5299, Jan "Yenya" Kasprzak and the Computer Systems
  Unit team at Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University as the original
  reporters of CVE-2015-5252 flaws, and Douglas Bagnall as the original
  reporter of CVE-2015-5330.

  All samba users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
