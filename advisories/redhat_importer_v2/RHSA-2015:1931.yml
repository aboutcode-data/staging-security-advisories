  - CVE-2015-1779
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  It was found that the QEMU's websocket frame decoder processed incoming
  frames without limiting resources used to process the header and the
  payload. An attacker able to access a guest's VNC console could use this
  flaw to trigger a denial of service on the host by exhausting all available
  memory and CPU. (CVE-2015-1779)

  This issue was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange of Red Hat.

  All qemu-kvm-rhev users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual
  machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
