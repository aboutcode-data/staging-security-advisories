  - CVE-2003-0963
summary: "Updated lftp packages are now available that fix a buffer overflow\nsecurity vulnerability.\n\
  \nlftp is a command-line file transfer program supporting FTP and HTTP\nprotocols. \n\nUlf\
  \ HÃ\x83Â¤rnhammar discovered a buffer overflow bug in versions of lftp up to\nand including\
  \ 2.6.9.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted\ndirectory on a website such that,\
  \ if a user connects to that directory\nusing the lftp client and subsequently issues a 'ls'\
  \ or 'rels' command, the\nattacker could execute arbitrary code on the users machine.  The\
  \ Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0963\
  \ to this issue.\n\nUsers of lftp are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\n\
  contain a backported security patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nRed Hat would\
  \ like to thank Ulf HÃ\x83Â¤rnhammar for discovering and alerting us\nto this issue."
