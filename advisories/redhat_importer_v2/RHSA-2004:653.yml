summary: |
  Updated versions of cross-platform Stronghold that fix security issues in
  mod_ssl and the Apache HTTP Server are now available.

  Stronghold 4 contains a number of open source technologies, including
  mod_ssl and the Apache HTTP Server.

  A buffer overflow in the get_tag function in mod_include for Apache 1.3.x
  to 1.3.32 allows local users who can create SSI documents to execute
  arbitrary code as the apache user via SSI (XSSI) documents that trigger a
  length calculation error.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0940 to this issue.

  mod_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using
  a AuthNonce secret. This could allow a malicious user who is able to sniff
  network traffic to conduct a replay attack against a website using Digest
  protection. Note that mod_digest implements an older version of the MD5
  Digest Authentication specification which is known not to work with modern
  browsers. This issue does not affect mod_auth_digest. (CAN-2003-0987)

  The mod_ssl module, when using the "SSLCipherSuite" directive in directory
  or location context, allows remote clients to bypass intended restrictions
  by using any cipher suite that is allowed by the virtual host
  configuration.  (CAN-2004-0885)

  Users of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are advised to update to these errata
  versions, which contain backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to
  these issues.
