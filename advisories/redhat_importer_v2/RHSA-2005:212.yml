  - CVE-2004-1006
summary: "An updated dhcp package that fixes a string format issue is now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe dhcp package provides the ISC Dynamic Host\
  \ Configuration Protocol\n(DHCP) server and relay agent, dhcpd. DHCP is a protocol that allows\n\
  devices to get their own network configuration information from a server.\n\nA bug was found\
  \ in the way dhcpd logs error messages.  A malicious DNS\nserver could send a carefully crafted\
  \ DNS reply and cause dhcpd to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0446 to this issue.\
  \ \n\nAll users of dhcp should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\nbackported\
  \ patch and is not vulnerable to this issue."
