summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nA flaw was found in the zend_hash_del() PHP function.\
  \ For PHP scripts that\nrely on the use of the unset() function, a remote attacker could force\n\
  variable initialization to be bypassed. This would be a security issue\nparticularly for installations\
  \ that enable the \"register_globals\" setting.\n\"register_globals\" is disabled by default\
  \ in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n(CVE-2006-3017)\n\nA directory traversal vulnerability was\
  \ found in PHP. Local users could\nbypass open_basedir restrictions allowing remote attackers\
  \ to create files\nin arbitrary directories via the tempnam() function. (CVE-2006-1494)\n\n\
  A flaw was found in the PHP IMAP MIME header decoding function.  An\nattacker could craft\
  \ a message with an overly long header which caused\nPHP to crash.  (CVE-2002-2214)\n\nUsers\
  \ of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that\
  \ resolve these issues."
