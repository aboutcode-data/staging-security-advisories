  - CVE-2010-1622
summary: |
  JBoss Web Framework Kit 1.0.0 contains a security flaw and should no
  longer be used. This update removes the JBoss Web Framework Kit 1.0.0
  packages.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications.

  The spring2 packages shipped as part of JBoss Web Framework Kit 1.0.0 are
  vulnerable to a security flaw that could allow a remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted HTTP request.
  (CVE-2010-1622)

  This update removes the JBoss Web Framework Kit 1.0.0 packages. JBoss Web
  Framework Kit 1.0.0 RPMs and updates will no longer be available from the
  Red Hat Network.

  Registered users wishing to continue to use the JBoss Web Framework Kit are
  advised to download the latest version, 1.1.0, from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal:

  https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/

  Future updates for JBoss Web Framework Kit will be made available only
  through the Red Hat Customer Portal. Note that JBoss Web Framework Kit
  1.1.0 from the Customer Portal does not include the Spring framework, and
  is therefore not affected by the CVE-2010-1622 issue.
