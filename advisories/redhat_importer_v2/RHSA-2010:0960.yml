  - CVE-2010-3862
summary: |
  Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1 packages that fix one
  security issue and various bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
  innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
  Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
  simple enterprise solution.

  A flaw was found in the JBoss Remoting component. A remote attacker could
  use specially-crafted input to cause the JBoss Remoting listeners to become
  unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition for services
  communicating via JBoss Remoting sockets. (CVE-2010-3862)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ole Husgaard of eXerp.com for reporting this
  issue.

  These updated packages include multiple bug fixes. Documentation for these
  bug fixes will be available shortly from the Release Notes, linked to in
  the References section.

  As well, this update adds a new jbossws-cxf package to JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 5.1.0, to provide the sources for jbossws-cxf.
  (BZ#645470)

  Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform "jboss-as/server/$PROFILE/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The
  JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
