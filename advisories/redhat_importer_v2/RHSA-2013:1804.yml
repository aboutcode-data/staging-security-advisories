  - CVE-2013-6629
summary: |
  An updated libjpeg package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The libjpeg package contains a library of functions for manipulating JPEG
  images. It also contains simple client programs for accessing the
  libjpeg functions.

  An uninitialized memory read issue was found in the way libjpeg decoded
  images with missing Start Of Scan (SOS) JPEG markers. A remote attacker
  could create a specially crafted JPEG image that, when decoded, could
  possibly lead to a disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
  (CVE-2013-6629)

  All libjpeg users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
