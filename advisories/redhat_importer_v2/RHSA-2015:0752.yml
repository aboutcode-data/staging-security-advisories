summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Storage 2.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  An invalid pointer use flaw was found in OpenSSL's ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
  function. A remote attacker could crash a TLS/SSL client or server using
  OpenSSL via a specially crafted X.509 certificate when the
  attacker-supplied certificate was verified by the application.
  (CVE-2015-0286)

  An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the
  way OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded inputs. An attacker able to
  make an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded
  input (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to
  crash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because
  the data being transferred is not Base64-encoded. (CVE-2015-0292)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2
  handshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
  TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both
  the SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL imported malformed
  Elliptic Curve private keys. A specially crafted key file could cause an
  application using OpenSSL to crash when imported. (CVE-2015-0209)

  An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the way OpenSSL reused certain
  ASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use a specially crafted
  ASN.1 structure that, when parsed by an application, would cause that
  application to crash. (CVE-2015-0287)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenSSL's X.509 certificate
  handling implementation. A specially crafted X.509 certificate could cause
  an application using OpenSSL to crash if the application attempted to
  convert the certificate to a certificate request. (CVE-2015-0288)

  A NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain
  PKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL
  verify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that
  application to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not
  affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0289)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting
  CVE-2015-0286, CVE-2015-0287, CVE-2015-0288, CVE-2015-0289, CVE-2015-0292,
  and CVE-2015-0293. Upstream acknowledges Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
  development team as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0286, Emilia Käsper
  of the OpenSSL development team as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0287,
  Brian Carpenter as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0288, Michal Zalewski
  of Google as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0289, Robert Dugal and David
  Ramos as the original reporters of CVE-2015-0292, and Sean Burford of
  Google and Emilia Käsper of the OpenSSL development team as the original
  reporters of CVE-2015-0293.

  All openssl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or
  the system rebooted.
