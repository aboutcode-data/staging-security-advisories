summary: "Multicluster Engine for Kubernetes 2.6.4 General Availability release\nimages, which\
  \ provide enhancements, bug fixes, and updated container\nimages.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having a security impact\nof Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives a detailed severity rating, is available for each\
  \ vulnerability from\nthe CVE links in the References section.\n\nMulticluster engine for\
  \ Kubernetes v2.6.4 images\n\nMulticluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational\
  \ components\nthat are necessary for the centralized management of multiple\nKubernetes-based\
  \ clusters across data centers, public clouds, and private\nclouds.\n\nYou can use the engine\
  \ to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform\nclusters or to bring existing Kubernetes-based\
  \ clusters under management by\nimporting them. After the clusters are managed, you can use\
  \ the APIs that\nare provided by the engine to distribute configuration based on placement\n\
  policy.\n\nSecurity fix(es):\n\nBacktracking regular expressions cause ReDoS (CVE-2024-45296)\
  \ \nReDoS vulnerability in multiparametric routes (CVE-2024-45813)\nDoS vulnerability in otelgrpc\
  \ due to unbound cardinality metrics (CVE-2023-47108)\n\nJira issues addressed: \n\n*  ACM-14853:\
  \ cluster-proxy addon stuck in state \"progressing... mca and\nwork configs mismatch\"\n\n\
