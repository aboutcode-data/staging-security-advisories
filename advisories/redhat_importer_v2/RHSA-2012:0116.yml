summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix various security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * The proc file system could allow a local, unprivileged user to obtain
  sensitive information or possibly cause integrity issues. (CVE-2011-1020,
  Moderate)

  * Non-member VLAN (virtual LAN) packet handling for interfaces in
  promiscuous mode and also using the be2net driver could allow an attacker
  on the local network to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3347,
  Moderate)

  * A missing validation flaw was found in the Linux kernel's m_stop()
  implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger
  a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3637, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the way splitting two extents in
  ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() worked. A local, unprivileged user with
  the ability to mount and unmount ext4 file systems could use this flaw to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3638, Moderate)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  key management facility handled user-defined key types. A local,
  unprivileged user could use the keyctl utility to cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2011-4110, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook for reporting CVE-2011-1020; Somnath
  Kotur for reporting CVE-2011-3347; and Zheng Liu for reporting
  CVE-2011-3638.

  This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
  Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
