summary: |
  An updated tomcat package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  This update corrects several security vulnerabilities in the Tomcat
  component shipped as part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server. In a typical
  operating environment, Tomcat is not exposed to users of Satellite Server
  in a vulnerable manner: By default, only Satellite Server applications are
  running on Tomcat. This update will reduce risk in unique Satellite Server
  environments.

  It was discovered that request dispatchers did not properly normalize user
  requests that have trailing query strings, allowing remote attackers to
  send specially-crafted requests that would cause an information leak.
  (CVE-2008-5515)

  A flaw was found in the way the Tomcat AJP (Apache JServ Protocol)
  connector processes AJP connections. An attacker could use this flaw to
  send specially-crafted requests that would cause a temporary denial of
  service. (CVE-2009-0033)

  It was discovered that web applications containing their own XML parsers
  could replace the XML parser Tomcat uses to parse configuration files. A
  malicious web application running on a Tomcat instance could read or,
  potentially, modify the configuration and XML-based data of other web
  applications deployed on the same Tomcat instance. (CVE-2009-0783)

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1 are advised to upgrade to
  this updated tomcat package, which contains backported patches to resolve
  these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.
