  This update fixes the following bug among others:

  * Previously, the Prometheus swagger definition contained a `$ref` property which could not be resolved. This caused a runtime error to occur when using the Prometheus operand creation form. This was fixed by adding a `definitions` property to schema returned by the `definitionFor` helper function so that the `$ref` property can resolve. There are no longer runtime errors when using the Prometheus operand creation form. (BZ#1885228)
