  - CVE-2012-2664
summary: |
  An updated sos package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The sos package contains a set of tools that gather information from system
  hardware, logs and configuration files. The information can then be used
  for diagnostic purposes and debugging.

  The sosreport utility collected the Kickstart configuration file
  ("/root/anaconda-ks.cfg"), but did not remove the root user's password from
  it before adding the file to the resulting archive of debugging
  information. An attacker able to access the archive could possibly use this
  flaw to obtain the root user's password. "/root/anaconda-ks.cfg" usually
  only contains a hash of the password, not the plain text password.
  (CVE-2012-2664)

  Note: This issue affected all installations, not only systems installed via
  Kickstart. A "/root/anaconda-ks.cfg" file is created by all installation
  types.

  The utility also collects yum repository information from
  "/etc/yum.repos.d" which in uncommon configurations may contain passwords.
  Any http_proxy password specified in these files will now be automatically
  removed. Passwords embedded within URLs in these files should be manually
  removed or the files excluded from the archive.

  All users of sos are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
