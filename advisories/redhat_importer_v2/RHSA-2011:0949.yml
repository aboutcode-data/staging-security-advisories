summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1, which fixes one security issue
  and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market-leading platform for
  innovative and scalable Java applications. JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam into a complete and simple enterprise solution.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 serves as a
  replacement to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.0. It includes
  various bug fixes which are detailed in the Release Notes. The Release
  Notes will be available shortly from the link in the References section.

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2011-1484 was incomplete: JBoss Seam 2
  did not block access to all malicious JBoss Expression Language (EL)
  constructs in page exception handling, allowing arbitrary Java methods to
  be executed. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code via a specially-crafted URL provided to certain applications based on
  the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly configured and enabled Java
  Security Manager would prevent exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2011-2196)

  If you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy of
  the JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the
  updated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.

  Red Hat would like to thank the ObjectWorks+ Development Team at Nomura
  Research Institute for reporting this issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, please back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.0 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 5.1.1.
