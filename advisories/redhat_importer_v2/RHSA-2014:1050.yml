  - CVE-2014-4615
summary: |
  Updated OpenStack Telemetry packages that fix one security issue and one
  bug are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Telemetry (ceilometer) collects customer usage data for metering
  purposes. Telemetry implements bus listener, push, and polling agents for
  data collection; this data is stored in a database and presented via the
  REST API. In addition, Telemetry's extensible design means it can be
  optionally extended to gather customized data sets.

  It was found that authentication tokens were not properly sanitized from
  the message queue by the notifier middleware. An attacker with read access
  to the message queue could possibly use this flaw to intercept an
  authentication token and gain elevated privileges. Note that all services
  using the notifier middleware configured after the auth_token middleware
  pipeline were affected. (CVE-2014-4615)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * An incompatibility issue was found with the recent update of the
  python-qpid package. This caused several OpenStack services, including
  OpenStack Telemetry, to malfunction. By updating the RPC code, this issue
  is now resolved. (BZ#1116462)

  All OpenStack Telemetry users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
