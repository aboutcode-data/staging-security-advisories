  - CVE-2014-3555
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Networking (Neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
  system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
  function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines.

  A denial of service flaw was found in Neutron's handling of allowed address
  pairs. There was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address pairs,
  possibly allowing a sufficiently authorized user to create such a large
  number of firewall rules as to impact performance, or potentially render a
  compute node unusable. (CVE-2014-3555)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Liping Mao from Cisco as the original reporter.

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue.
