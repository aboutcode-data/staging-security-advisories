aliases:
  - CVE-2015-2721
  - CVE-2015-2730
summary: |
  Updated nss packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications.

  It was found that NSS permitted skipping of the ServerKeyExchange packet
  during a handshake involving ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key
  Exchange). A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the
  forward-secrecy of a TLS/SSL connection. (CVE-2015-2721)

  A flaw was found in the way NSS verified certain ECDSA (Elliptic Curve
  Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures. Under certain conditions, an
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct signature forgery attacks.
  (CVE-2015-2730)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Karthikeyan Bhargavan as the original reporter of
  CVE-2015-2721, and Watson Ladd as the original reporter of CVE-2015-2730.

  The nss packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.19.1, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.

  All nss users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues.
