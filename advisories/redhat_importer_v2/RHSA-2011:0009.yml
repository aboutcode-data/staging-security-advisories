summary: |
  Updated evince packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Evince is a document viewer.

  An array index error was found in the DeVice Independent (DVI) renderer's
  PK and VF font file parsers. A DVI file that references a specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause Evince to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Evince.
  (CVE-2010-2640, CVE-2010-2641)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the DVI renderer's AFM font
  file parser. A DVI file that references a specially-crafted font file
  could, when opened, cause Evince to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Evince.
  (CVE-2010-2642)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the DVI renderer's TFM font file
  parser. A DVI file that references a specially-crafted font file could,
  when opened, cause Evince to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running Evince. (CVE-2010-2643)

  Note: The above issues are not exploitable unless an attacker can trick the
  user into installing a malicious font file.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting these
  issues.  Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the original
  reporter of these issues.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues.
