  - CVE-2017-14604
summary: |
  An update for nautilus is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Nautilus is the file manager and graphical shell for the GNOME desktop.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An untrusted .desktop file with executable permission set could choose its displayed name and icon, and execute commands without warning when opened by the user. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into opening a .desktop file disguised as a document, such as a PDF, and execute arbitrary commands. (CVE-2017-14604)

  Note: This update will change the behavior of Nautilus. Nautilus will now prompt the user for confirmation when executing an untrusted .desktop file for the first time, and then add it to the trusted file list. Desktop files stored in the system directory, as specified by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, are always considered trusted and executed without prompt.
