  - CVE-2003-0079
summary: "Updated hanterm packages fix two security issues.\n\nHangul Terminal is a terminal\
  \ emulator for the X Window System, based on Xterm.\n\nHangul Terminal provides an escape\
  \ sequence for reporting the current\nwindow title, which essentially takes the current title\
  \ and places it\ndirectly on the command line.  An attacker can craft an escape sequence\n\
  that sets the window title of a victim using Hangul Terminal to an\narbitrary command and\
  \ then report it to the command line.   Since it is not\npossible to embed a carriage return\
  \ into the window title the attacker\nwould then have to convince the victim to press Enter\
  \ for it to process the\ntitle as a command, although the attacker could craft other escape\n\
  sequences that might convince the victim to do so.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to lock\
  \ up Hangul Terminal before version 2.0.5\nby sending an invalid DEC UDK escape sequence.\
  \  \n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nHangul Terminal\
  \ version 2.0.5."
