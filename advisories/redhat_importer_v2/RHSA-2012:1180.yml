summary: |
  Updated gimp packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
  editing program.

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF
  plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
  decompression algorithm implementation used by the GIMP's GIF image format
  plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted GIF image file that,
  when opened, could cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP.
  (CVE-2011-2896)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file
  format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette
  file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matthias Weckbecker of the SUSE Security Team
  for reporting the CVE-2012-3481 issue.

  Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
