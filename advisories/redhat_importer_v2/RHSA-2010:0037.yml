summary: |
  Updated acroread packages that fix multiple security issues and three bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Adobe Reader allows users to view and print documents in Portable Document
  Format (PDF).

  This update fixes several vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader. These
  vulnerabilities are summarized on the Adobe Security Advisory APSB10-02
  page listed in the References section. A specially-crafted PDF file could
  cause Adobe Reader to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the
  user running Adobe Reader when opened. (CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2009-3953,
  CVE-2009-3954, CVE-2009-3955, CVE-2009-3959, CVE-2009-3956)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * the acroread process continued to run even after closing a PDF file. If
  multiple PDF files were opened and then closed, the acroread processes
  continued to run and consume system resources (up to 100% CPU usage). With
  this update, the acroread process correctly exits, which resolves this
  issue. (BZ#473217)

  * the PPKLite.api plug-in was missing, causing Adobe Reader to crash when
  attempting to open signed PDF files. For such files, if an immediate crash
  was not observed, clicking on the Signature Panel could trigger one. With
  this update, the PPKLite.api plug-in is included, which resolves this
  issue. (BZ#472975)

  * Adobe Reader has been upgraded to version 9.3. (BZ#497957)

  Adobe have discontinued support for Adobe Reader 8 for Linux. All users of
  Adobe Reader are advised to install these updated packages, which contain
  Adobe Reader version 9.3, which is not vulnerable to these issues and fixes
  these bugs. All running instances of Adobe Reader must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
