  - CVE-2016-5408
summary: |
  An update for squid is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the fix for CVE-2016-4051 released via RHSA-2016:1138 did not properly prevent the stack overflow in the munge_other_line() function. A remote attacker could send specially crafted data to the Squid proxy, which would exploit the cachemgr CGI utility, possibly triggering execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5408)

  Red Hat would like to thank Amos Jeffries (Squid) for reporting this issue.
