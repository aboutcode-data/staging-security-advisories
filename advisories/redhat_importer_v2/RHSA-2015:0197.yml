  - CVE-2014-3511
summary: |
  Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix two security issues and
  several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Manager 3.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
  machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
  and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
  64-bit operating systems.

  A race condition was found in the way OpenSSL handled ServerHello messages
  with an included Supported EC Point Format extension. A malicious server
  could possibly use this flaw to cause a multi-threaded TLS/SSL client using
  OpenSSL to write into freed memory, causing the client to crash or execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3509)

  A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled fragmented handshake packets.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to force a TLS/SSL server
  using OpenSSL to use TLS 1.0, even if both the client and the server
  supported newer protocol versions. (CVE-2014-3511)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, various clipboard managers, operating on the client or on the
  guest, would occasionally lose synchronization, which resulted in clipboard
  data loss and the SPICE console freezing. Now, spice-gtk have been patched,
  such that clipboard synchronization does not freeze the SPICE console
  anymore. (BZ#1083489)

  * Prior to this update, when a SPICE console was launched from the Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization User Portal with the 'Native Client' invocation
  method and 'Open in Full Screen' selected, the displays of the guest
  virtual machine were not always configured to match the client displays.
  After this update, the SPICE console will show a full-screen guest display
  for each client monitor. (BZ#1076243)

  * A difference in behavior between Linux and Windows clients caused an
  extra nul character to be sent when pasting text in a guest machine from a
  Windows client. This invisible character was visible in some Java
  applications. With this update, the extra nul character is removed from
  text strings and no more extraneous character would appear. (BZ#1090122)

  * Previously, If the clipboard is of type image/bmp, and the data is of 0
  size, GTK+ will crash. With this update, the data size is checked first,
  and GTK+ no longer crashes when clipboard is of type image/bmp, and the
  data is of 0 size. (BZ#1090433)

  * Modifier-only key combinations cannot be registered by users as hotkeys
  so if a user tries to set a modifier-only key sequence (for example,
  'ctrl+alt') as the hotkey for releasing the cursor, it will fail, and the
  user will be able to release the cursor from the window. With this update,
  when a modifier-only hotkey is attempted to be registered, it will fall
  back to the default cursor-release sequence (which happens to be
  'ctrl+alt'). (BZ#985319)

  * Display configuration sometimes used outdated information about the
  position of the remote-viewer windows in order to align and configure the
  guest displays. Occasionally, this caused the guest displays to became
  unexpectedly swapped when a window is resized. With this update,
  remote-viewer will always use the current window locations to align
  displays, rather than using a possibly outdated cached location
  information. (BZ#1018182)

  All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
