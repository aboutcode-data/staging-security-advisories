summary: |
  Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3.1 that fixes one security issue, multiple bugs,
  and adds various enhancements is now available for Ubuntu 14.04.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
  storage platform that combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage
  system with a Ceph management platform, deployment tools, and
  support services.

  A feature in Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) allows to return a specific HTTP
  header that contains the name of a bucket that was accessed. It was found
  that the returned HTTP headers were not sanitized. An unauthenticated
  attacker could use this flaw to craft HTTP headers in responses that would
  confuse the load balancer residing in front of RGW, potentially resulting
  in a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5245)

  The ceph packages have been upgraded to upstream version 0.94.3 and the
  radosgw-agent packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.2.3.
  The new versions provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous versions. (BZ#1238415)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * This update fixes various bugs in the Ceph monitor nodes and the Ceph
  Object Storage Device (OSD) Daemons. (BZ#1219040, BZ#1223941, BZ#1265973)

  * With this update, when using the Civetweb server, the Ceph Object Gateway
  no longer reports the full object size downloaded even though the download
  was aborted in the middle. (BZ#1235845)

  * The Civetweb server now correctly displays the HTTP return code in the
  log files. (BZ#1245663)

  * The Ceph Object Gateway now correctly assigns Access Control Lists (ACL)
  to new objects created during the copy operation. (BZ#1253766)

  * Under certain circumstances, copying an object onto itself (for example,
  to change its metadata) produced a truncated object. The truncated object
  had correct metadata, including the original size, but the underlying RADOS
  object was smaller. Consequently, when a client attempted to fetch the
  object, it received less data than indicated by the Content-Length header,
  blocked for more, and eventually timed out. This bug has been fixed, and
  the object can now be read successfully in the aforementioned scenario.
  (BZ#1258618)

  * The Ceph Object Gateway no longer requires the "requiretty" setting to be
  disabled in the sudoers configuration for the root user. (BZ#1238521)

  * In certain scenarios, when all acting set Ceph Object Storage Device
  (OSD) Daemons for a placement group (PG) were restarted during the backfill
  process, the OSDs failed to peer the PG. Now, the OSDs peer the PGs as
  expected. (BZ#1223532)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

  * Administrators of the Ceph Object Gateway can now configure the maximum
  number of buckets for users by using the new "rgw_user_max_buckets" option
  in the Ceph configuration file. (BZ#1254343)

  * The suicide timeout option is now configurable. The option ensures that
  poorly behaving OSDs self-terminate instead of running in degraded states
  and slowing traffic. (BZ#1210825)

  * The rhcs-installer package provides a new Foreman-based installer.
  This update adds the new rhcs-installer package to Red Hat Ceph Storage as
  a Technology Preview. (BZ#1213026, BZ#1213086, BZ#1220961)

  All Red Hat Ceph Storage users are advised to upgrade to this new version,
  which corrects these issues and adds these enhancements.
