  Security Fix(es):

  * OpenShift Container Platform 4 did not sanitize secret data written to static Pod logs when an Operator's log level was set to Debug or higher. A low privileged user could read Pod logs to discover secret material if the log level had already been modified in an Operator by a privileged user. (CVE-2019-14854)
