summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite
  implementation handled sending of certain UDP packets over sockets that
  used the UDP_CORK option when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) feature
  was enabled on the output device. A local, unprivileged user could use this
  flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4470, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the perf_trace_event_perm() function in the
  Linux kernel checked permissions for the function tracer functionality.
  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to enable function tracing
  and cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2013-2930, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the net_ctl_permissions() function in the
  Linux kernel checked access permissions. A local, unprivileged user could
  potentially use this flaw to access certain files in /proc/sys/net
  regardless of the underlying file system permissions. (CVE-2013-4270,
  Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Adaptec RAID controller
  (aacraid) checked permissions of compat IOCTLs. A local attacker could use
  this flaw to bypass intended security restrictions. (CVE-2013-6383,
  Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the get_dumpable() function return value was
  interpreted in the ptrace subsystem of the Linux kernel. When
  'fs.suid_dumpable' was set to 2, a local, unprivileged local user could
  use this flaw to bypass intended ptrace restrictions and obtain
  potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2013-2929, Low)

  * An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in the Marvell 8xxx
  Libertas WLAN (libertas) driver in the Linux kernel. A local user able to
  write to a file that is provided by the libertas driver and located on the
  debug file system (debugfs) could use this flaw to crash the system. Note:
  The debugfs file system must be mounted locally to exploit this issue.
  It is not mounted by default. (CVE-2013-6378, Low)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IPv6
  source address-based routing implementation. A local attacker who has the
  CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this flaw to crash the system.
  (CVE-2013-6431, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
  CVE-2013-4470. The CVE-2013-4270 issue was discovered by Miroslav Vadkerti
  of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes multiple bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
  kernel to version kernel-rt-3.8.13-rt27, correct these issues, and fix the
  bugs noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. The system must
  be rebooted for this update to take effect.
