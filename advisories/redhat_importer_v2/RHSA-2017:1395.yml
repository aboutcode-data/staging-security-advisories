  - CVE-2017-8779
summary: |
  An update for libntirpc is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.2 for RHEL 6 and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.2 for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  This package contains a new implementation of the original libtirpc, transport-independent RPC (TI-RPC) library for NFS-Ganesha.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that due to the way rpcbind uses libtirpc (libntirpc), a memory leak can occur when parsing specially crafted XDR messages. An attacker sending thousands of messages to rpcbind could cause its memory usage to grow without bound, eventually causing it to be terminated by the OOM killer. (CVE-2017-8779)
