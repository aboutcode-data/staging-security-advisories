summary: |
  An updated squirrelmail package that fixes a security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SquirrelMail is an easy-to-configure, standards-based, webmail package
  written in PHP. It includes built-in PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP
  protocols, and pure HTML 4.0 page-rendering (with no JavaScript required)
  for maximum browser-compatibility, strong MIME support, address books, and
  folder manipulation.

  The Red Hat SquirrelMail packages provided by the RHSA-2009:0010 advisory
  introduced a session handling flaw. Users who logged back into SquirrelMail
  without restarting their web browsers were assigned fixed session
  identifiers. A remote attacker could make use of that flaw to hijack user
  sessions. (CVE-2009-0030)

  SquirrelMail users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  patch to correct this issue. As well, all users who used affected versions
  of SquirrelMail should review their preferences.
