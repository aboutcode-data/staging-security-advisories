  - CVE-2004-0233
summary: |
  An updated utempter package that fixes a potential symlink vulnerability is
  now available.

  Utempter is a utility that allows terminal applications such as xterm and
  screen to update utmp and wtmp without requiring root privileges.

  Steve Grubb discovered a flaw in Utempter which allowed device names
  containing directory traversal sequences such as '/../'.  In combination
  with an application that trusts the utmp or wtmp files, this could allow a
  local attacker the ability to overwrite privileged files using a symlink.

  Users should upgrade to this new version of utempter, which fixes this
  vulnerability.
