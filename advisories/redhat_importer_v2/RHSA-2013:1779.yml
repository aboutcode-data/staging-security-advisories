  - CVE-2013-4566
summary: |
  An updated mod_nss package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The mod_nss module provides strong cryptography for the Apache HTTP Server
  via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  protocols, using the Network Security Services (NSS) security library.

  A flaw was found in the way mod_nss handled the NSSVerifyClient setting for
  the per-directory context. When configured to not require a client
  certificate for the initial connection and only require it for a specific
  directory, mod_nss failed to enforce this requirement and allowed a client
  to access the directory when no valid client certificate was provided.
  (CVE-2013-4566)

  Red Hat would like to thank Albert Smith of OUSD(AT&L) for reporting this
  issue.

  All mod_nss users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue. The httpd service must be restarted
  for this update to take effect.
