summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0, which fixes multiple security
  issues, various bugs, and adds several enhancements, is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  This JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 release serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2, and includes
  bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 5.2.0 Release Notes for information on the most significant of
  these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  An attack technique against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when block
  ciphers were used in CBC mode could allow a remote attacker to conduct
  chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading to the recovery of the entire plain text
  of a particular cryptogram. (CVE-2011-1096)

  JBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric
  keys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire
  plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)

  Spring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)
  expressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in
  the context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information
  from the server. Manual action is required to apply this fix. Refer to the
  Solution section. (CVE-2011-2730)

  Apache CXF checked to ensure XML elements were signed or encrypted by a
  Supporting Token, but not whether the correct token was used. A remote
  attacker could transmit confidential information without the appropriate
  security, and potentially circumvent access controls on web services
  exposed via Apache CXF. Refer to the Solution section for details.
  (CVE-2012-2379)

  When an application used FORM authentication, along with another component
  that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to
  FormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was
  possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator
  by appending "/j_security_check" to the end of a URL. (CVE-2012-3546)

  The JMX Console was vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing a remote attacker
  to hijack the authenticated JMX Console session of an administrator.
  (CVE-2011-2908)

  An XSS flaw allowed a remote attacker to perform an XSS attack against
  victims using the JMX Console. (CVE-2011-4575)

  SecurityAssociation.getCredential() returned the previous credential if
  no security context was provided. Depending on the deployed applications,
  this could possibly allow a remote attacker to hijack the credentials of a
  previously-authenticated user. (CVE-2012-3370)

  Configuring the JMX Invoker to restrict access to users with specific
  roles did not actually restrict access, allowing remote attackers with
  valid JMX Invoker credentials to perform JMX operations accessible to
  roles they are not a member of. (CVE-2012-5478)

  twiddle.sh accepted credentials as command line arguments, allowing local
  users to view them via a process listing. (CVE-2009-5066)

  The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow
  unauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security
  interceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation
  of this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently
  disabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context
  of the user running the JBoss server. (CVE-2012-0874)

  The JGroups diagnostics service was enabled with no authentication when a
  JGroups channel was started, allowing attackers on the adjacent network to
  read diagnostic information. (CVE-2012-2377)

  CallerIdentityLoginModule retained the password from the previous call if a
  null password was provided. In non-default configurations this could
  possibly lead to a remote attacker hijacking a previously-authenticated
  user's session. (CVE-2012-3369)

  Red Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for
  reporting CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487; the Apache CXF project for
  reporting CVE-2012-2379; and Tyler Krpata for reporting CVE-2011-4575.
