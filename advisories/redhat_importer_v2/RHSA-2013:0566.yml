summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues and multiple
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way UTF-8 characters were
  converted to UTF-16 in the utf8s_to_utf16s() function of the Linux kernel's
  FAT file system implementation. A local user able to mount a FAT file
  system with the "utf8=1" option could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2013-1773, Important)

  * It was found that the RHSA-2012:0333 update did not correctly fix the
  CVE-2011-4131 issue. A malicious Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)
  server could return a crafted reply to a GETACL request, causing a denial
  of service on the client. (CVE-2012-2375, Moderate)

  * A memory disclosure flaw was found in the way the load_script() function
  in the binfmt_script binary format handler handled excessive recursions. A
  local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to
  user-space by executing specially-crafted scripts. (CVE-2012-4530, Low)

  * A flaw was found in the way file permission checks for the "/dev/kmsg"
  file were performed in restricted root environments (for example, when
  using a capability-based security model). A local user able to write to
  this file could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-1772, Low)

  The CVE-2012-2375 issue was discovered by Jian Li of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes multiple bugs. Documentation for these changes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
  kernel to version kernel-rt-3.6.11-rt28, correct these issues, and fix the
  bugs noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. The system must
  be rebooted for this update to take effect.
