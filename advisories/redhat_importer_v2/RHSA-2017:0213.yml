summary: |
  An update for nagios is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Nagios is a program that monitors hosts and services on your network, and has the ability to send email or page alerts when a problem arises or is resolved. Nagios is written in C and designed to run under Linux (and some other *NIX variants) as a background process, intermittently running checks on various services that you specify. The actual service checks are performed by separate "plugin" programs which return the status of the checks to Nagios. Nagios plugins are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagiosplug. This package provides the core program, web interface, and documentation files for Nagios. Development files are built as a separate package.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Various command-execution flaws were found in the Snoopy library included with Nagios. These flaws allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating Nagios HTTP headers. (CVE-2008-7313, CVE-2014-5008, CVE-2014-5009)

  * It was found that an attacker who could control the content of an RSS feed could execute code remotely using the Nagios web interface. This flaw could be used to gain access to the remote system and in some scenarios control over the system. (CVE-2016-9565)

  * A privileges flaw was found in Nagios where log files were unsafely handled. An attacker who could control Nagios logging configuration ('nagios' user/group) could exploit the flaw to elevate their access to that of a privileged user. (CVE-2016-9566)

  Red Hat would like to thank Dawid Golunski for reporting CVE-2016-9565 and CVE-2016-9566.
