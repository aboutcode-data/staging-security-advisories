  - CVE-2010-2956
summary: |
  An updated sudo package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
  certain users the ability to run commands as root.

  A flaw was found in the way sudo handled Runas specifications containing
  both a user and a group list. If a local user were authorized by the
  sudoers file to perform their sudo commands with the privileges of a
  specified user and group, they could use this flaw to run those commands
  with the privileges of either an arbitrary user or group on the system.
  (CVE-2010-2956)

  Red Hat would like to thank Markus Wuethrich of Swiss Post - PostFinance
  for reporting this issue.

  Users of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
