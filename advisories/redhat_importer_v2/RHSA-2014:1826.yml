summary: |
  Updated libvncserver packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  LibVNCServer is a library that allows for easy creation of VNC server or
  client functionality.

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way screen sizes were handled by LibVNCServer. A malicious VNC
  server could use this flaw to cause a client to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code in the client. (CVE-2014-6051)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in LibVNCServer's framebuffer
  setup. A malicious VNC server could use this flaw to cause a VNC client to
  crash. (CVE-2014-6052)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way LibVNCServer handled
  certain ClientCutText message. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash the VNC server by sending a specially crafted ClientCutText message
  from a VNC client. (CVE-2014-6053)

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the way LibVNCServer handled the scaling
  factor when it was set to "0". A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash the VNC server using a malicious VNC client. (CVE-2014-6054)

  Two stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way LibVNCServer
  handled file transfers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
  VNC server using a malicious VNC client. (CVE-2014-6055)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT
  acknowledges Nicolas Ruff as the original reporter.

  All libvncserver users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  applications linked against libvncserver must be restarted for this update
  to take effect.
