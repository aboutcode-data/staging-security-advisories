summary: |
  An update for the Apache Camel component that fixes one security issue is
  now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat JBoss BRMS
  6.0.0, and Red Hat JBoss BPMS 6.0.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  score, which gives detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link
  in the References section.

  Apache Camel is a versatile open-source integration framework based on
  known Enterprise Integration Patterns.

  A flaw was found in Apache Camel's parsing of the FILE_NAME header.
  A remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would
  write the provided message to a file, could provide expression language
  (EL) expressions in the FILE_NAME header that would be evaluated on the
  server. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context
  of the Camel server process. (CVE-2013-4330)

  All users of the affected products as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this update.
