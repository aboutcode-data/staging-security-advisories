  - CVE-2010-3698
summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled the reloading of fs and gs
  segment registers when they had invalid selectors. A privileged host user
  with access to "/dev/kvm" could use this flaw to crash the host (denial of
  service). (CVE-2010-3698)

  All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. Note: The procedure in the Solution
  section must be performed before this update will take effect.
