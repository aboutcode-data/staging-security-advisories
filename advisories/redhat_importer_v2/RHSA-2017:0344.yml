summary: |
  An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for RHEV 3.X Hypervisor and Agents for RHEL-6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Quick emulator (Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA data via bitblt copy in backward mode. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with privileges of Qemu process on the host. (CVE-2017-2615)

  * An out-of-bounds read-access flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with IP checksum routines. The flaw could occur when computing a TCP/UDP packet's checksum, because a QEMU function used the packet's payload length without checking against the data buffer's size. A user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process (denial of service). (CVE-2016-2857)
