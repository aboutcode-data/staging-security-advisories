  - CVE-2010-1168
  - CVE-2010-1447
summary: |
  Updated perl packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
  administration utilities and web programming. The Safe extension module
  allows users to compile and execute Perl code in restricted compartments.

  The Safe module did not properly restrict the code of implicitly called
  methods (such as DESTROY and AUTOLOAD) on implicitly blessed objects
  returned as a result of unsafe code evaluation. These methods could have
  been executed unrestricted by Safe when such objects were accessed or
  destroyed. A specially-crafted Perl script executed inside of a Safe
  compartment could use this flaw to bypass intended Safe module
  restrictions. (CVE-2010-1168)

  The Safe module did not properly restrict code compiled in a Safe
  compartment and executed out of the compartment via a subroutine reference
  returned as a result of unsafe code evaluation. A specially-crafted Perl
  script executed inside of a Safe compartment could use this flaw to bypass
  intended Safe module restrictions, if the returned subroutine reference was
  called from outside of the compartment. (CVE-2010-1447)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tim Bunce for responsibly reporting the
  CVE-2010-1168 and CVE-2010-1447 issues. Upstream acknowledges Nick Cleaton
  as the original reporter of CVE-2010-1168, and Tim Bunce and Rafaël
  Garcia-Suarez as the original reporters of CVE-2010-1447.

  These packages upgrade the Safe extension module to version 2.27. Refer to
  the Safe module's Changes file, linked to in the References, for a full
  list of changes.

  Users of perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. All applications using the Safe extension module must
  be restarted for this update to take effect.
