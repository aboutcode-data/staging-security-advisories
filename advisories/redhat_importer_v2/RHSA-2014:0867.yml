summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the sys_recvfile() function
  of nmbd, the NetBIOS message block daemon, processed non-blocking sockets.
  An attacker could send a specially crafted packet that, when processed,
  would cause nmbd to enter an infinite loop and consume an excessive amount
  of CPU time. (CVE-2014-0244)

  A flaw was found in the way Samba created responses for certain
  authenticated client requests when a shadow-copy VFS module was enabled.
  An attacker able to send an authenticated request could use this flaw to
  disclose limited portions of memory per each request. (CVE-2014-0178)

  It was discovered that smbd, the Samba file server daemon, did not properly
  handle certain files that were stored on the disk and used a valid Unicode
  character in the file name. An attacker able to send an authenticated
  non-Unicode request that attempted to read such a file could cause smbd to
  crash. (CVE-2014-3493)

  Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Berteaud of FIREWALL-SERVICES SARL for
  reporting CVE-2014-0244, and the Samba project for reporting CVE-2014-0178
  and CVE-2014-3493. The Samba project acknowledges Christof Schmitt as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-0178, and Simon Arlott as the original
  reporter of CVE-2014-3493.

  All Samba users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
