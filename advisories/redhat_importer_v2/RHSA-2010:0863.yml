  - CVE-2010-1322
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos KDC
  handled TGS (Ticket-granting Server) request messages. A remote,
  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash the KDC or, possibly,
  disclose KDC memory or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  KDC (krb5kdc). (CVE-2010-1322)

  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos Team for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Mike Roszkowski as the original reporter.

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
  packages, the krb5kdc daemon will be restarted automatically.
