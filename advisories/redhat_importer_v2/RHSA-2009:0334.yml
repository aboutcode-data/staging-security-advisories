  - CVE-2009-0520
summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes several security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 Extras.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Firefox-compatible Adobe Flash Player
  Web browser plug-in.

  Multiple input validation flaws were found in the way Flash Player
  displayed certain SWF (Shockwave Flash) content. An attacker could use
  these flaws to create a specially-crafted SWF file that could cause
  flash-plugin to crash, or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when the victim
  loaded a page containing the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2009-0520,
  CVE-2009-0519)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
  upgrades Flash Player to version 9.0.159.0.
