summary: |
  This is the 6-month notification of the End Of Life plans for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy, the
  regular 7 year life-cycle of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 will end on
  February 29, 2012.

  After this date, Red Hat will discontinue the regular subscription services
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4. Therefore, new bug fix, enhancement, and
  security errata updates, as well as technical support services will no
  longer be available for the following products:

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 4
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 4
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extras 4
  * Red Hat Desktop 4
  * Red Hat Global File System 4
  * Red Hat Cluster Suite 4

  Customers still running production workloads on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
  are advised to begin planning the upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or
  6. Active subscribers of Red Hat Enterprise Linux already have access to
  all currently maintained versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as part of
  their subscription without additional fees.

  For customers who are unable to migrate off Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
  before its end-of-life date, Red Hat intends to offer a limited, optional
  extension program. For more information, contact your Red Hat sales
  representative or channel partner.

  Details of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life-cycle can be found on the Red
  Hat website: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/
