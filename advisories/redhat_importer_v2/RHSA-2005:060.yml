summary: |
  An updated Squid package that fixes several security issues is now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Gopher relay parser. This bug
  could allow a remote Gopher server to crash the Squid proxy that reads data
  from it. Although Gopher servers are now quite rare, a malicious webpage
  (for example) could redirect or contain a frame pointing to an attacker's
  malicious gopher server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0094 to this issue.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the WCCP message parser. It is
  possible to crash the Squid server if an attacker is able to send a
  malformed WCCP message with a spoofed source address matching Squid's
  "home router". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0095 to this issue.

  A memory leak was found in the NTLM fakeauth_auth helper. It is possible
  that an attacker could place the Squid server under high load, causing the
  NTML fakeauth_auth helper to consume a large amount of memory, resulting in
  a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0096 to this issue.

  A NULL pointer de-reference bug was found in the NTLM fakeauth_auth helper.
  It is possible for an attacker to send a malformed NTLM type 3 message,
  causing the Squid server to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0097 to
  this issue.

  A username validation bug was found in squid_ldap_auth. It is possible for
  a username to be padded with spaces, which could allow a user to bypass
  explicit access control rules or confuse accounting. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2005-0173 to this issue.

  The way Squid handles HTTP responses was found to need strengthening. It is
  possible that a malicious Web server could send a series of HTTP responses
  in such a way that the Squid cache could be poisoned, presenting users with
  incorrect webpages. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-0174 and CAN-2005-0175 to
  these issues.

  A bug was found in the way Squid handled oversized HTTP response headers.
  It is possible that a malicious Web server could send a specially crafted
  HTTP header which could cause the Squid cache to be poisoned, presenting
  users with incorrect webpages. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0241 to this issue.

  A buffer overflow bug was found in the WCCP message parser. It is possible
  that an attacker could send a malformed WCCP message which could crash the
  Squid server or execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0211
  to this issue.

  Users of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches, and is not vulnerable to these issues.
