summary: |
  Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.4.6, fix several bugs, add various enhancements, and resolve one security
  issue are now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  The following security issue is addressed with this release:

  It was found that the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL) allowed the
  processing of untrusted XML documents to utilize external entity
  references, which could access resources on the host system and,
  potentially, allowing arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2015-0254)

  Note: Tag Library users may need to take additional steps after applying
  this update. Detailed instructions on the additional steps can be found
  here:

  Red Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX, and the Apache Software
  Foundation for reporting the CVE-2015-0254 flaw.

  Application Platform 6.4.5, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.6 Release Notes, linked to in the
  References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages. The JBoss server
  process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
