summary: |
  The Linux Netfilter team has found a problem in the "IRC connection
  tracking" component of the firewall within the linux kernel. This problem
  affects Red Hat Linux versions 7.1 and 7.2.

  The Linux Netfilter team has found a problem in the IRC connection
  tracking component of the firewall within the linux kernel. This component
  is distributed with kernels in Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2, although it is
  not used in default installations.

  The problem consists of an excessively broad netmask setting which is
  applied to check if an "IRC DCC" connection through a masquerading firewall
  should be allowed. This results in unwanted ports being opened on the
  firewall, which could, depending on the firewall filter ruleset, allow
  inbound connections.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2002-0060 to this issue.  Thanks to Jozsef Kadlecsik
  and Harald Welte of the netfilter team.

  Users are advised to upgrade to this errata kernel containing patches
  which fix these issues.
