summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and bugs in the\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.\n\nThis security advisory has been rated as\
  \ having moderate security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Linux kernel\
  \ handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThese new kernel packages contain\
  \ fixes for the security issues described\nbelow:\n\n* a flaw in the ISDN CAPI subsystem that\
  \ allowed a remote user to cause a\ndenial of service or potential remote access. Exploitation\
  \ would require\nthe attacker to be able to send arbitrary frames over the ISDN network to\n\
  the victim's machine. (CVE-2007-1217, Moderate) \n\n* a flaw in the perfmon subsystem on ia64\
  \ platforms that allowed a local\nuser to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2006-0558, Moderate)\n\
  \nIn addition, the following bugs were addressed:\n\n* a panic after reloading of the LSI\
  \ Fusion driver.\n\n* a vm performance problem was corrected by balancing inactive page lists.\n\
  \n* added a nodirplus option to address NFSv3 performance issues with large\ndirectories.\n\
  \n* changed the personality handling to disallow personality changes of\nsetuid and setgid\
  \ binaries. This ensures they keep any randomization and\nExec-shield protection.\n\nAll Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated\
  \ with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum."
