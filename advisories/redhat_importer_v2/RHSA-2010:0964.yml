  - CVE-2010-4265
summary: |
  An updated jboss-remoting package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Remoting is a framework for building distributed applications in
  Java.

  The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0.CP09 updates RHSA-2010:0937
  and RHSA-2010:0938 did not, unlike the errata texts stated, provide a fix
  for CVE-2010-3862. A remote attacker could use specially-crafted input to
  cause the JBoss Remoting listeners to become unresponsive, resulting in a
  denial of service condition for services communicating via JBoss Remoting
  sockets. (CVE-2010-4265)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ole Husgaard of eXerp.com for reporting this
  issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, backup your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform installation (including all applications and
  configuration files).

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3 on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 and 5 should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue. The JBoss server process must be
  restarted for this update to take effect.
