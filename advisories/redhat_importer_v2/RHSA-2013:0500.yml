summary: |
  Updated hplip packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The hplip packages contain the Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing
  Project (HPLIP), which provides drivers for Hewlett-Packard printers and
  multi-function peripherals.

  Several temporary file handling flaws were found in HPLIP. A local attacker
  could use these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting
  arbitrary files accessible to a process using HPLIP. (CVE-2013-0200,
  CVE-2011-2722)

  The CVE-2013-0200 issues were discovered by Tim Waugh of Red Hat.

  The hplip packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.12.4, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#731900)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the hpijs package required the obsolete cupsddk-drivers
  package, which was provided by the cups package. Under certain
  circumstances, this dependency caused hpijs installation to fail. This
  bug has been fixed and hpijs no longer requires cupsddk-drivers.
  (BZ#829453)

  * The configuration of the Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) back end is
  located in the /etc/sane.d/dll.d/ directory, however, the hp-check
  utility checked only the /etc/sane.d/dll.conf file. Consequently,
  hp-check checked for correct installation, but incorrectly reported a
  problem with the way the SANE back end was installed. With this update,
  hp-check properly checks for installation problems in both locations as
  expected. (BZ#683007)

  All users of hplip are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  fix these issues and add these enhancements.
