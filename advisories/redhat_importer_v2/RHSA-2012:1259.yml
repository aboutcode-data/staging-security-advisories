summary: |
  Updated quagga packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Quagga is a TCP/IP based routing software suite. The Quagga bgpd daemon
  implements the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing protocol. The Quagga
  ospfd and ospf6d daemons implement the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
  routing protocol.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the bgpd daemon
  processed malformed Extended Communities path attributes. An attacker could
  send a specially-crafted BGP message, causing bgpd on a target system to
  crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running bgpd. The UPDATE message would have to arrive from an explicitly
  configured BGP peer, but could have originated elsewhere in the BGP
  network. (CVE-2011-3327)

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon
  processed malformed Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use
  this flaw to crash ospf6d on an adjacent router. (CVE-2011-3323)

  A flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon processed malformed link
  state advertisements. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash
  ospf6d on a target system. (CVE-2011-3324)

  A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed Hello
  packets. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash ospfd on a
  target system. (CVE-2011-3325)

  A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed link state
  advertisements. An OSPF router in the autonomous system could use this flaw
  to crash ospfd on a target system. (CVE-2011-3326)

  An assertion failure was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
  certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
  cause ospfd on an adjacent router to abort. (CVE-2012-0249)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
  certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
  crash ospfd on an adjacent router. (CVE-2012-0250)

  Two flaws were found in the way the bgpd daemon processed certain BGP OPEN
  messages. A configured BGP peer could cause bgpd on a target system to
  abort via a specially-crafted BGP OPEN message. (CVE-2012-0255,
  CVE-2012-1820)

  Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2011-3327,
  CVE-2011-3323, CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and CVE-2011-3326; and the
  CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2012-0249, CVE-2012-0250, CVE-2012-0255, and
  CVE-2012-1820. CERT-FI acknowledges Riku Hietamäki, Tuomo Untinen and Jukka
  Taimisto of the Codenomicon CROSS project as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-3327, CVE-2011-3323, CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and
  CVE-2011-3326. The CERT/CC acknowledges Martin Winter at
  OpenSourceRouting.org as the original reporter of CVE-2012-0249,
  CVE-2012-0250, and CVE-2012-0255, and Denis Ovsienko as the original
  reporter of CVE-2012-1820.

  Users of quagga should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the bgpd, ospfd, and ospf6d daemons will be restarted
  automatically.
