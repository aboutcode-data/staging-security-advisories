summary: |
  Updated lesstif packages that fix flaws in the Xpm library are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  This update has been rated as having Moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  LessTif provides libraries which implement the Motif industry standard
  graphical user interface.

  application linked to LessTif. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
