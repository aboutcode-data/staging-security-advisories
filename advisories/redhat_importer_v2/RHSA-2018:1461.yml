  - CVE-2018-1111
summary: |
  An update for dhcp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast address. The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC DHCP service required to enable and administer DHCP on a network.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A command injection flaw was found in the NetworkManager integration script included in the DHCP client packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. A malicious DHCP server, or an attacker on the local network able to spoof DHCP responses, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on systems using NetworkManager and configured to obtain network configuration using the DHCP protocol. (CVE-2018-1111)

  Red Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team) for reporting this issue.
