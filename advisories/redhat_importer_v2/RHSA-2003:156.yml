  - CVE-2002-0989
summary: |
  Updated gaim packages that fix a number of vulnerabilities are now
  available for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  Gaim is an all-in-one instant messaging client that lets you use a number
  of messaging protocols such as AIM, ICQ, and Yahoo, all at once.

  Versions of gaim prior to 0.59.1 contain a bug in the URL handler of
  the manual browser option.  A link can be carefully crafted to contain
  an arbitrary shell script, which will be executed if the user clicks on
  the link.

  Versions of gaim prior to 0.58 contain a buffer overflow in the
  Jabber plug-in module.

  Users of gaim should update to these errata packages containing gaim
  0.59.1 which is not vulnerable to these issues.
