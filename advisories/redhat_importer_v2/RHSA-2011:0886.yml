summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled malformed JPEG images. An
  HTML mail message containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Thunderbird
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-2377)

  Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in Thunderbird. Malicious HTML
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-0083,
  CVE-2011-0085, CVE-2011-2363)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML content.
  Malicious HTML content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2011-2364, CVE-2011-2365, CVE-2011-2374, CVE-2011-2375, CVE-2011-2376)

  It was found that Thunderbird could treat two separate cookies (for web
  content) as interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one
  of those domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the
  same-origin policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the
  wrong domain. (CVE-2011-2362)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
