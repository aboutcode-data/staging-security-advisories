summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes one
  security issue and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality. OpenID4Java allows you to implement
  OpenID authentication in your Java applications. OpenID4Java is a
  Technology Preview.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise SOA
  Platform 5.2.0. It includes various bug fixes. The following security issue
  is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was
  not checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to
  receive information that an application only trusts the identity provider
  to assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
  man-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information
  via a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid
  example application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
