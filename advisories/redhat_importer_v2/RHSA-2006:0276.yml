summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language\
  \ commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nThe phpinfo() PHP function did not properly\
  \ sanitize long strings.  An\nattacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks\
  \ against\nsites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo(). \n(CVE-2006-0996)\n\
  \nThe html_entity_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An\nattacker could\
  \ use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory.  In\norder for this issue to be\
  \ exploitable the target site would need to have a\nPHP script which called the \"html_entity_decode()\"\
  \ function with untrusted\ninput from the user and displayed the result.  (CVE-2006-1490)\n\
  \nThe error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in\ncertain cases.\
  \  An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site\nscripting attacks against sites\
  \ where both display_errors and html_errors\nare enabled.  (CVE-2006-0208)\n\nAn input validation\
  \ error was found in the \"mb_send_mail()\" function.  An\nattacker could use this flaw to\
  \ inject arbitrary headers in a mail sent via\na script calling the \"mb_send_mail()\" function\
  \ where the \"To\" parameter can\nbe controlled by the attacker.  (CVE-2005-3883)\n\nA buffer\
  \ overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of\nWashington's IMAP Server.  php-imap\
  \ is compiled against the static c-client\nlibraries from imap and therefore needed to be\
  \ recompiled against the fixed\nversion.  This issue only affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux\
  \ 3.\n(CVE-2005-2933).\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\n\
  backported patches that resolve these issues."
