  - CVE-2013-6044
summary: |
  Updated python-django packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
  development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much
  as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

  It was discovered that the django.utils.http.is_safe_url() function
  considered any URL that used a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS (for
  example, "javascript:") as safe. An attacker could potentially use this
  flaw to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2013-6044)

  A directory traversal flaw was found in Django's "ssi" template tag, which
  takes a file path as input and outputs that file's contents. An attacker
  able to alter templates that made use of the "ssi" tag on a site could use
  this flaw to access any local files accessible to Django. (CVE-2013-4315)

  Red Hat would like to thank James Bennett of Django for reporting
  CVE-2013-4315.

  All python-django users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct these issues.
