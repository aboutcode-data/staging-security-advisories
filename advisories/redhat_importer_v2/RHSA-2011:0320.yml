  - CVE-2011-1006
  - CVE-2011-1022
summary: |
  Updated libcgroup packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libcgroup packages provide tools and libraries to control and monitor
  control groups.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libcgroup converted
  a list of user-provided controllers for a particular task into an array of
  strings. A local attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges
  via a specially-crafted list of controllers. (CVE-2011-1006)

  It was discovered that libcgroup did not properly check the origin of
  Netlink messages. A local attacker could use this flaw to send crafted
  Netlink messages to the cgrulesengd daemon, causing it to put processes
  into one or more existing control groups, based on the attacker's choosing,
  possibly allowing the particular tasks to run with more resources (memory,
  CPU, etc.) than originally intended. (CVE-2011-1022)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nelson Elhage for reporting the CVE-2011-1006
  issue.

  All libcgroup users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
