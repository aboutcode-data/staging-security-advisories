summary: |
  Updated kdegraphics packages that resolve several security issues in kpdf
  are now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop Environment
  including kpdf, a pdf file viewer.

  Several flaws were discovered in kpdf. An attacker could construct a
  carefully crafted PDF file that could cause kpdf to crash or possibly
  execute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project assigned the names CVE-2005-3191, CVE-2005-3192, and
  CVE-2005-3193 to these issues.

  Users of kpdf should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve these issues.
