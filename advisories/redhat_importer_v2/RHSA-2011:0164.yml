summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
  the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

  The MySQL PolyFromWKB() function did not sanity check Well-Known Binary
  (WKB) data, which could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to crash
  mysqld. (CVE-2010-3840)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed certain JOIN queries could allow a
  remote, authenticated attacker to cause excessive CPU use (up to 100%), if
  a stored procedure contained JOIN queries, and that procedure was executed
  twice in sequence. (CVE-2010-3839)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed queries that provide a mixture of numeric
  and longblob data types to the LEAST or GREATEST function, could allow a
  remote, authenticated attacker to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3838)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed PREPARE statements containing both
  GROUP_CONCAT and the WITH ROLLUP modifier could allow a remote,
  authenticated attacker to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3837)

  MySQL did not properly pre-evaluate LIKE arguments in view prepare mode,
  possibly allowing a remote, authenticated attacker to crash mysqld.
  (CVE-2010-3836)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed statements that assign a value to a
  user-defined variable and that also contain a logical value evaluation
  could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to crash mysqld.
  (CVE-2010-3835)

  A flaw in the way MySQL evaluated the arguments of extreme-value functions,
  such as LEAST and GREATEST, could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to
  crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3833)

  A flaw in the way MySQL handled LOAD DATA INFILE requests allowed MySQL to
  send OK packets even when there were errors. (CVE-2010-3683)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed EXPLAIN statements for some complex
  SELECT queries could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to crash
  mysqld. (CVE-2010-3682)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed certain alternating READ requests
  provided by HANDLER statements could allow a remote, authenticated attacker
  to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3681)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statements that
  define NULL columns when using the InnoDB storage engine, could allow a
  remote, authenticated attacker to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3680)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed certain values provided to the BINLOG
  statement caused MySQL to read unassigned memory. A remote, authenticated
  attacker could possibly use this flaw to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3679)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed SQL queries containing IN or CASE
  statements, when a NULL argument was provided as one of the arguments to
  the query, could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to crash mysqld.
  (CVE-2010-3678)

  A flaw in the way MySQL processed JOIN queries that attempt to retrieve
  data from a unique SET column could allow a remote, authenticated attacker
  to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3677)

  Note: CVE-2010-3840, CVE-2010-3838, CVE-2010-3837, CVE-2010-3835,
  CVE-2010-3833, CVE-2010-3682, CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-3680, CVE-2010-3678,
  and CVE-2010-3677 only cause a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was
  automatically restarted after each crash.

  These updated packages upgrade MySQL to version 5.1.52. Refer to the MySQL
  release notes for a full list of changes:

  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-52.html

  All MySQL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon
  (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.
