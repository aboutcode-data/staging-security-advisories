  - CVE-2019-9500
summary: |
  An update for kpatch-patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  This is a kernel live patch module which is automatically loaded by the RPM post-install script to modify the code of a running kernel.

  Security fix(es):

  * If the Wake-up on Wireless LAN functionality is configured in the brcmfmac driver, which only works with Broadcom FullMAC chipsets, a malicious event frame can be constructed to trigger a heap buffer overflow in the brcmf_wowl_nd_results() function. This vulnerability can be exploited by compromised chipsets to compromise the host, or when used in combination with another brcmfmac driver flaw (CVE-2019-9503), can be used remotely. This can result in a remote denial of service (DoS). Due to the nature of the flaw, a remote privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. (CVE-2019-9500)
