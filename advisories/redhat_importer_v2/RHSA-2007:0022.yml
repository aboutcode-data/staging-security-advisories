summary: "A new squirrelmail package that fixes security issues is now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nSquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in\
  \ PHP.\n\nSeveral cross-site scripting bugs were discovered in SquirrelMail.  An\nattacker\
  \ could inject arbitrary Javascript or HTML content into\nSquirrelMail pages by tricking a\
  \ user into visiting a carefully crafted\nURL.  (CVE-2006-6142) \n\nUsers of SquirrelMail\
  \ should upgrade to this erratum package, which\ncontains a backported patch to correct these\
  \ issues. \n\nNotes:\n- After installing this update, users are advised to restart their\n\
  httpd service to ensure that the updated version functions correctly.\n- config.php should\
  \ NOT be modified, please modify config_local.php instead.\n- Known Bug: The configuration\
  \ generator may potentially produce bad\noptions that interfere with the operation of this\
  \ application.  Applying\nspecific config changes to config_local.php manually is recommended."
