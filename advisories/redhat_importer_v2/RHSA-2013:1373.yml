summary: |
  An update for the JBoss Remoting component of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1 that
  fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Remoting is a framework for building distributed applications in
  Java.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of the
  org.jboss.remoting.transport.socket.ServerThread class in JBoss Remoting.
  An attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available file descriptors
  on the target server, preventing legitimate connections. Note that to
  exploit this flaw remotely, the remoting port must be exposed directly or
  indirectly (for example, deploying a public facing application that uses
  JBoss Remoting could indirectly expose this flaw). (CVE-2013-4210)

  This issue was discovered by James Livingston of the Red Hat Support
  Engineering Group.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this update.
