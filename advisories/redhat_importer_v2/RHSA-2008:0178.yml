  - CVE-2008-0072
summary: "Updated evolution packages that fix a format string bug are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 4.5 Extended Update Support. \n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nEvolution is the GNOME\
  \ collection of personal information management (PIM)\ntools.\n\nA format string flaw was\
  \ found in the way Evolution displayed encrypted\nmail content. If a user opened a carefully\
  \ crafted mail message, arbitrary\ncode could be executed as the user running Evolution. (CVE-2008-0072)\n\
  \nAll users of Evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain a backported\
  \ patch which resolves this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ulf Härnhammar of Secunia\
  \ Research for finding\nand reporting this issue."
