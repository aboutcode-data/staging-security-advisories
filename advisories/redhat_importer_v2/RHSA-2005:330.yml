summary: "Updated krb5 packages which fix two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the\nincluded\
  \ Kerberos-aware telnet client are now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nKerberos is a networked\
  \ authentication system which uses a trusted third\nparty (a KDC) to authenticate clients\
  \ and servers to each other.\n\nThe krb5-workstation package includes a Kerberos-aware telnet\
  \ client. \nTwo buffer overflow flaws were discovered in the way the telnet client\nhandles\
  \ messages from a server.  An attacker may be able to execute\narbitrary code on a victim's\
  \ machine if the victim can be tricked into\nconnecting to a malicious telnet server. The\
  \ Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2005-0468\
  \ and\nCAN-2005-0469 to these issues.\n\nUsers of krb5 should update to these erratum packages\
  \ which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank\
  \ iDEFENSE for their responsible disclosure of\nthis issue."
