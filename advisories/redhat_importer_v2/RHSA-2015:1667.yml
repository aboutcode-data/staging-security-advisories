  - CVE-2015-3185
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
  and extensible web server.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
  responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
  these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
  differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
  HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

  It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function
  ap_some_auth_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was
  authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using
  this API function could consequently allow access that should have been
  denied. (CVE-2015-3185)

  All httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd service will be restarted automatically.
