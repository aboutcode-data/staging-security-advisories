  - CVE-2003-0971
summary: |
  Updated gnupg packages are now available for Red Hat Linux.  These updates
  disable the ability to generate ElGamal keys (used for both signing and
  encrypting) and disable the ability to use ElGamal public keys for
  encrypting data.

  GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.

  Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses
  ElGamal keys, when those keys are used both to sign and encrypt data.  This
  vulnerability can be used to trivially recover the private key.  While the
  default behavior of GnuPG when generating keys does not lead to the
  creation of unsafe keys, by overriding the default settings an unsafe key
  could have been created.

  If you are using ElGamal keys, you should revoke those keys immediately.

  The packages included in this update do not make ElGamal keys safe to use;
  they merely include a patch by David Shaw that disables functions that
  would generate or use ElGamal keys.

  To determine if your key is affected, run the following command to obtain a
  list of secret keys that you have on your secret keyring:

  gpg --list-secret-keys

  The output of this command includes both the size and type of the keys
  found, and will look similar to this example:

  /home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg
  ----------------------------------------------------
  sec  1024D/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>
  uid                            Example User <example@example.com>

  The key length, type, and ID are listed together, separated by a forward
  slash.  In the example output above, the key's type is "D" (DSA, sign
  and encrypt).  Your key is unsafe if and only if the key type is "G"
  (ElGamal, sign and encrypt).  In the above example, the secret key is safe
  to use, while the secret key in the following example is not:

  /home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg
  ----------------------------------------------------
  sec  1024G/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>
  uid                            Example User <example@example.com>

  revoke any keys that are unsafe, refer to the advisory available from the
