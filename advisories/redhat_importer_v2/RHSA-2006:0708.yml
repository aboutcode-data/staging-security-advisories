  - CVE-2006-4812
summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix an integer overflow flaw are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP\
  \ memory handling routines. If\na script can cause memory allocation based on untrusted user\
  \ data, a remote\nattacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute arbitrary code\n\
  as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-4812) \n\nThis issue did not affect the PHP packages distributed\
  \ with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 3 or 4.\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages\
  \ which contain a\nbackported patch that corrects this issue."
