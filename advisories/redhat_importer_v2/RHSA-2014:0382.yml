  - CVE-2014-0105
summary: |
  Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command line utility for
  interacting with the OpenStack Identity API. The OpenStack Identity
  auth_token middleware component handles the authentication of tokens
  with keystone.

  When using the auth_token middleware with the memcached token cache
  enabled, a token for a different identity could be returned. An
  authenticated user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges by
  making repeated requests that could eventually allow the user to acquire
  the administrator's identity. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups
  using auth_token with memcached were affected. (CVE-2014-0105)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Kieran Spear from the University of Melbourne as the
  original reporter.

  The python-keystoneclient package has been upgraded to version 0.7.1.
  Additionally, the python-six package has been upgraded to version 1.5.2,
  required by the updated python-keystoneclient package.

  All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, all
  OpenStack services using auth_token must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
