summary: "Updated ntp packages that fix several security issues are now available for \nRed\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated\
  \ this update as having Important security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\
  \ base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\
  \ from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nThe Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used\
  \ to synchronize a computer's time\nwith a referenced time source.\n\nMultiple buffer overflow\
  \ flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto_recv(),\nctl_putdata(), and configure() functions.\
  \ A remote attacker could use\neither of these flaws to send a specially crafted request packet\
  \ that could\ncrash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of\n\
  the ntp user. Note: the crypto_recv() flaw requires non-default\nconfigurations to be active,\
  \ while the ctl_putdata() flaw, by default, can\nonly be exploited via local attackers, and\
  \ the configure() flaw requires\nadditional authentication to exploit. (CVE-2014-9295)\n\n\
  It was found that ntpd automatically generated weak keys for its internal\nuse if no ntpdc\
  \ request authentication key was specified in the ntp.conf\nconfiguration file. A remote attacker\
  \ able to match the configured IP\nrestrictions could guess the generated key, and possibly\
  \ use it to send\nntpdc query or configuration requests. (CVE-2014-9293)\n\nIt was found that\
  \ ntp-keygen used a weak method for generating MD5 keys.\nThis could possibly allow an attacker\
  \ to guess generated MD5 keys that\ncould then be used to spoof an NTP client or server. Note:\
  \ it is\nrecommended to regenerate any MD5 keys that had explicitly been generated\nwith ntp-keygen;\
  \ the default installation does not contain such keys.\n(CVE-2014-9294)\n\nA missing return\
  \ statement in the receive() function could potentially\nallow a remote attacker to bypass\
  \ NTP's authentication mechanism.\n(CVE-2014-9296)\n\nAll ntp users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues. After\
  \ installing the\nupdate, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically."
