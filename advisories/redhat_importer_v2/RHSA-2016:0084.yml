  - CVE-2016-1714
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix two security issues and three bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way QEMU's IDE AHCI emulator
  processed certain AHCI Native Command Queuing (NCQ) AIO commands.
  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process
  instance or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with
  privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2016-1568)

  An out-of-bounds read/write flaw was discovered in the way QEMU's Firmware
  Configuration device emulation processed certain firmware configurations.
  A privileged (CAP_SYS_RAWIO) guest user could use this flaw to crash the
  QEMU process instance or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host
  with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2016-1714)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Marvel Team for
  reporting the CVE-2016-1568 issue, and Donghai Zhu of Alibaba for reporting
  the CVE-2016-1714 issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Incorrect handling of the last sector of an image file could trigger an
  assertion failure in qemu-img. This update changes the handling of the last
  sector, and no assertion failure occurs. (BZ#1299345)

  * Previously, rebooting a guest after multiple memory hot-plugs in some
  cases caused the qemu-kvm process to terminate unexpectedly, and the reboot
  to fail. This update fixes the problem, and guests with hot-plugged memory
  reboot successfully. (BZ#1288096)

  * When the OHCI driver received an interrupt during the suspending process,
  the interrupt was not acknowledged. As a consequence, the interrupt kept
  being sent repeatedly, and the system became unresponsive. This update
  modifies the suspend procedure to acknowledge the interrupt, which prevents
  the described problem. (BZ#1298971)

  All qemu-kvm-rhev users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual
  machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
