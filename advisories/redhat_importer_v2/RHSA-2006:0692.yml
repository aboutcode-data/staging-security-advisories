  - CVE-2006-3918
summary: "An updated version of Apache that addresses several security issues is now\navailable\
  \ for Stronghold 4.0 for Enterprise Linux.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful,\
  \ full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nA bug was found in Apache\
  \ where an invalid Expect header sent to the server\nwas returned to the user in an unescaped\
  \ error message. This could\nallow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack if\
  \ a victim was\ntricked into connecting to a site and sending a carefully crafted Expect\n\
  header. (CVE-2006-3918)\n\nWhile a web browser cannot be forced to send an arbitrary Expect\
  \ header by\na third-party attacker, it was recently discovered that certain versions of\n\
  the Flash plugin can manipulate request headers. If users running such\nversions can be persuaded\
  \ to load a web page with a malicious Flash applet,\na cross-site scripting attack against\
  \ the server may be possible.\n\nA flaw in mod_imap when using the Referer directive with\
  \ image maps was\ndiscovered. With certain site configurations, a remote attacker could\n\
  perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim can be forced to visit a\nmalicious URL\
  \ using certain web browsers.  (CVE-2005-3352)\n\nUsers of Stronghold should upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages, which \ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue."
