summary: |
  An update for rh-postgresql95-postgresql is now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.8 and Red Hat Satellite 5.8 ELS.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  This update applies only to Satellite 5.8 instances using either embedded or managed PostgreSQL databases.

  There are manual steps required in order to finish the migration from postgresql92-postgresql to rh-postgresql95-postgresql. If these steps are not undertaken, the affected Satellite will continue to use PostgreSQL 9.2.

  postgresql92-postgresql will be upgraded automatically to rh-postgresql95-postgresql as part of an upgrade to Satellite 5.8.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that some selectivity estimation functions did not check user privileges before providing information from pg_statistic, possibly leaking information. A non-administrative database user could use this flaw to steal some information from tables they are otherwise not allowed to access. (CVE-2017-7484)

  * It was discovered that the PostgreSQL client library (libpq) did not enforce the use of TLS/SSL for a connection to a PostgreSQL server when the PGREQUIRESSL environment variable was set. An man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to strip the SSL/TLS protection from a connection between a client and a server. (CVE-2017-7485)

  * It was found that the pg_user_mappings view could disclose information about user mappings to a foreign database to non-administrative database users. A database user with USAGE privilege for this mapping could, when querying the view, obtain user mapping data, such as the username and password used to connect to the foreign database. (CVE-2017-7486)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Robert Haas as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7484; Daniel Gustafsson as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7485; and Andrew Wheelwright as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7486.
