summary: |
  Updated versions of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are available that fix
  security issues affecting OpenSSL and the Apache HTTP Server. A number
  of bug fixes are also included.

  Stronghold 4 contains a number of open source technologies, including
  OpenSSL 0.9.6 and the Apache HTTP Server.

  Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool
  uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6d that can
  lead to a denial of service attack (infinite loop). The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-0081 to this issue.

  Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool
  uncovered a null-pointer assignment in the do_change_cipher_spec() function
  in OpenSSL 0.9.6c-0.9.6k and 0.9.7a-0.9.7c. A remote attacker could
  send a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake which could lead to a denial of
  service attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0079 to this issue.

  Testing performed by Novell using a test suite provided by NISCC uncovered
  an issue in the ASN.1 parser in versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 prior to 0.9.6l
  which could cause large recursion and possibly lead to a denial of service
  attack if used where stack space is limited. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0851
  to this issue.

  An issue in the handling of regular expressions from configuration files
  was discovered in releases of the Apache HTTP Server version 1.3 prior to
  1.3.29. To exploit this issue an attacker would need to have the ability
  to write to Apache configuration files such as .htaccess or httpd.conf. A
  carefully-crafted configuration file can cause an exploitable buffer
  overflow and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
  context of the server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0542 to this issue.

  Users of Stronghold 4 cross-platform are advised to update to these errata
  versions, which contain backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to
  these issues.
