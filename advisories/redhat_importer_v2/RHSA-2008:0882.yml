summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix a security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2008-0016, CVE-2008-4058, CVE-2008-4059, CVE-2008-4060, CVE-2008-4061,
  CVE-2008-4062)

  Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was displayed. A
  web page containing specially crafted content could potentially trick a
  SeaMonkey user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-3835,
  CVE-2008-4067, CVE-2008-4068, CVE-2008-4069)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handles mouse click events. A web page
  containing specially crafted JavaScript code could move the content window
  while a mouse-button was pressed, causing any item under the pointer to be
  dragged. This could, potentially, cause the user to perform an unsafe
  drag-and-drop action. (CVE-2008-3837)

  A flaw was found in SeaMonkey that caused certain characters to be stripped
  from JavaScript code. This flaw could allow malicious JavaScript to bypass
  or evade script filters. (CVE-2008-4065, CVE-2008-4066)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
