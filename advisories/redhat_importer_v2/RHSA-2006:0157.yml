aliases:
  - CVE-2005-3745
summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Application Server components are now available including a
  security update for Struts.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Application Server packages provide a J2EE Application Server and
  Web container as well as the underlying Java stack.

  A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Struts displays error
  pages. It may be possible for an attacker to construct a specially crafted
  URL which could fool a victim into believing they are viewing a trusted
  site. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the
  name CVE-2005-3745 to this issue. Please note that this issue does not
  affect Struts running on Tomcat or JOnAS, which is our supported usage of
  Struts.

  All users of Red Hat Application Server should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain Struts version 1.2.8 which is not vulnerable to
  this issue.
