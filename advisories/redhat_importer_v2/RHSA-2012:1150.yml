  - CVE-2012-3375
summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A memory leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory
  subsystem handled resource clean up in the mmap() failure path when the
  MAP_HUGETLB flag was set. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2390, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll)
  subsystem handled resource clean up when an ELOOP error code was returned.
  A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2012-3375, Moderate)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The MRG 2.1 realtime kernel lacked support for automatic memory
  reservation for the kdump kernel, as present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  kernels. Using the parameter crashkernel=auto on the kernel boot command
  line led to kdump being disabled because no memory was correctly reserved.
  Support for crashkernel=auto has been implemented in the 3.0 realtime
  kernel and now when the crashkernel=auto parameter is specified, machines
  with more than 4GB of RAM have the amount of memory required by the kdump
  kernel calculated and reserved. (BZ#820427)

  * The current bnx2x driver in the MRG 2.1 realtime kernel had faulty
  support for the network adapter PCI ID 14e4:168e and did not work
  correctly. The bnx2x driver was updated to include support for this network
  adapter. (BZ#839037)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt
  kernel to version kernel-rt-3.0.36-rt57, and correct these issues. The
  system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
