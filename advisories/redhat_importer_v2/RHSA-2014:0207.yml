summary: |
  An updated rubygems package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third-party
  libraries.

  It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
  unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
  a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
  of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

  Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter.

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.2 are advised to upgrade to
  this updated package, which contains a backported patch to correct this
  issue.
