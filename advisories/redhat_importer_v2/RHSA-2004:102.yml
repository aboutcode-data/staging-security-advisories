summary: "Updated gdk-pixbuf packages that fix a denial of service vulnerability that\ncould\
  \ affect applications such as Evolution are now available.\n\nThe gdk-pixbuf package contains\
  \ an image loading library used with the \nGNOME GUI desktop environment.  In Red Hat Linux\
  \ 9 this library is used by\napplications, such as Evolution, to load images.\n\nThomas Kristensen\
  \ discovered a bitmap file that would cause the Evolution\nmail reader to crash.  This issue\
  \ was caused by a flaw that affects\nversions of the gdk-pixbuf package prior to 0.20.  To\
  \ exploit this flaw, a\nremote attacker could send (via email) a carefully-crafted BMP file,\
  \ which\nwould cause Evolution to crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0111\nto this issue.\n\nUsers are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated packages containing\ngdk-pixbuf version 0.22, which is not vulnerable\
  \ to this issue."
