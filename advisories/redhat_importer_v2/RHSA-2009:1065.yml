aliases:
  - CVE-2009-0588
summary: |
  An updated rhpki-ra package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Red Hat registration authority is an optional Red Hat Certificate
  System subsystem that acts as a front-end for authenticating and processing
  enrollment requests, PIN reset requests, and formatting requests.

  Robert Mead of AusCERT reported that the registration authority did not
  properly check an agent's authorization in some CGI scripts. In deployments
  where certificate requests were processed by multiple agent groups, an
  agent from any group was able to approve or reject certificate requests in
  the queue for any other agent group, if they were able to guess the request
  ID. (CVE-2009-0588)

  All Red Hat Certificate System 7.3 users should upgrade to this updated
  package, which resolves this issue.
