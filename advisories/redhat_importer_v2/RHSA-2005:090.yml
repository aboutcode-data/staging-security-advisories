  - CVE-2005-0085
summary: |
  Updated htdig packages that fix a security flaw are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The ht://Dig system is a Web search and indexing system for a small domain
  or intranet.

  Michael Krax reported a cross-site scripting bug affecting htdig. An
  attacker could construct a carefully crafted URL which can cause a web
  browser to execute malicious script once visited.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-0085
  to this issue.

  Users of htdig should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch, and are not vulnerable to this issue.
