summary: "Updated libtiff packages that fix various integer overflows are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team\n\nThe libtiff package contains a library of functions\
  \ for manipulating TIFF\n(Tagged Image File Format) image format files.\n\ninfamous41md discovered\
  \ integer overflow flaws in libtiff.  An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted TIFF file\
  \ in such a way that it could\ncause an application linked with libtiff to overflow a heap\
  \ buffer when the\nfile was opened by a victim.  Due to the nature of the overflow it is\n\
  unlikely that it is possible to use this flaw to execute arbitrary code. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1308 to this issue.\
  \ \n\nDmitry V. Levin discovered an integer overflow flaw in libtiff.  An\nattacker could\
  \ create a carefully crafted TIFF file in such a way that it\ncould cause an application linked\
  \ with libtiff to crash.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-1183 to this issue. \n\nAll users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported fixes for these issues."
