summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL determined which hashing algorithm to
  use when TLS protocol version 1.2 was enabled. This could possibly cause
  OpenSSL to use an incorrect hashing algorithm, leading to a crash of an
  application using the library. (CVE-2013-6449)

  It was discovered that the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
  protocol implementation in OpenSSL did not properly maintain encryption and
  digest contexts during renegotiation. A lost or discarded renegotiation
  handshake packet could cause a DTLS client or server using OpenSSL to
  crash. (CVE-2013-6450)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled
  TLS/SSL protocol handshake packets. A specially crafted handshake packet
  could cause a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2013-4353)

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or
  the system rebooted.
