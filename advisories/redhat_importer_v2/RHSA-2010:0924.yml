summary: |
  Updated wireshark packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was
  previously known as Ethereal.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Wireshark Local Download
  Sharing Service (LDSS) dissector. If Wireshark read a malformed packet off
  a network or opened a malicious dump file, it could crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark. (CVE-2010-4300)

  A denial of service flaw was found in Wireshark. Wireshark could crash or
  stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or opened a
  malicious dump file. (CVE-2010-3445)

  Users of Wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Wireshark version 1.2.13, and resolve these issues. All running instances
  of Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.
