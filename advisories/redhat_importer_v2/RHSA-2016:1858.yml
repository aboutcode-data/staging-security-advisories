summary: |
  An update for ruby193-rubygem-actionpack is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that Action View tag helpers did not escape quotes when using strings declared as HTML safe as attribute values. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. (CVE-2016-6316)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Andrew Carpenter (Critical Juncture) as the original reporter.
