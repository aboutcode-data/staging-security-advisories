  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, after upgrading Red Hat Virtualization Host from rhvh-4.1-0.20180425.0 to rhvh-4.2.4.3-0.20180627, the owner and group of sshd.conf were incorrectly changed from root:root to sssd:sssd. As a result, RHEL IdM accounts using sssd could not ssh into the host. The current release fixes this issue. (BZ#1608513)
