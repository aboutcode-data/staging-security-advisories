  - CVE-2015-3456
summary: |
  Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix one security issue are now
  available.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor packages provide a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the way QEMU's virtual
  Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) handled FIFO buffer access while processing
  certain FDC commands. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
  the guest or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the host with the
  privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to the guest.
  (CVE-2015-3456)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jason Geffner of CrowdStrike for reporting
  this issue.

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package.
