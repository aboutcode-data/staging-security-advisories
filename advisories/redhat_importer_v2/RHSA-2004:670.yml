  - CVE-2004-1154
summary: "Updated samba packages that fix an integer overflow vulnerability are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n\nSamba provides file and printer sharing services to SMB/CIFS\
  \ clients.\n\nGreg MacManus of iDEFENSE Labs has discovered an integer overflow bug in\nSamba\
  \ versions prior to 3.0.10.  An authenticated remote user could exploit\nthis bug which may\
  \ lead to arbitrary code execution on the Samba server. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1154 to this issue.\n\nUsers of\
  \ Samba should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches,\
  \ and are not vulnerable to these issues."
