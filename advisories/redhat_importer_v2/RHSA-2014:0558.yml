summary: |
  An updated rhevm-reports package that fixes three security issues and one
  bug is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization reports package provides a suite of
  pre-configured reports and dashboards that enable you to monitor the
  system. The reports module is based on JasperReports and JasperServer, and
  can also be used to create ad-hoc reports.

  It was found that the ovirt-engine-reports setup script logged the reports
  database password in plain text to a world-readable file. An attacker with
  a local user account on the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
  server could use this flaw to access, read, and modify the reports
  database. (CVE-2014-0199)

  Note: Applying the update provided by this advisory does not modify any
  existing log files. It is recommended that you search your existing log
  files and remove any occurrences of plain text passwords manually.

  It was found that the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager reports
  datasource configuration file (js-jboss7-ds.xml) was world-readable.
  An attacker with a local user account on the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager server could use this flaw to access, read, and
  modify the reports database. (CVE-2014-0200)

  It was found that multiple ovirt-engine-reports configuration files were
  world-readable. An attacker with a local user account on the Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager server could use this flaw to access a
  variety of potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0201)

  These issues were discovered by Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, rhevm-reports-setup failed if the default spacing of the
  pg_hba.conf file was manually modified. Now, the command does not check
  exact spacing in the file, and setup completes successfully. (BZ#1085374)

  All rhevm-reports users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which corrects these issues.
