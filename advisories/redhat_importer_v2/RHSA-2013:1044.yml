  - CVE-2013-2165
summary: |
  Updated jboss-seam2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The JBoss Seam 2 framework is an application framework for building web
  applications in Java. The RichFaces component is an open source framework
  that adds Ajax capability into existing JavaServer Faces (JSF)
  applications.

  A flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled
  deserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the
  execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed
  on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending
  on the deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-2165)

  The fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be
  deserialized by RichFaces.

  If you require to whitelist a class that is not already listed, for
  example, a custom class, you can achieve this by following one of these
  methods:

  Method 1: Implementing the SerializableResource interface.
  In RichFaces 3, this is defined at
  org.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource and in RichFaces 4/5, at
  org.richfaces.resource.SerializableResource.

  Method 2: Adding the class to the resource-serialization.properties file
  (a default properties file is provided once this update is applied).
  To do this you can extend the framework provided properties file that is
  available under org.ajax4jsf.resource in RichFaces 3 and
  org.richfaces.resource in RichFaces 4/5. The modified properties file has
  to be copied into the classpath of your deployment under the
  version-specific packages.

  Where possible, it is recommended that Method 1 be followed.

  Red Hat would like to thank Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure
  Directions, Inc.) for reporting this issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
  and configuration files).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 on
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
