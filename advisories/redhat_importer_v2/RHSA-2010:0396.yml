summary: |
  Updated httpd and httpd22 packages that fix two security issues and add one
  enhancement are now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

  It was discovered that mod_proxy_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
  Server Error" response when processing certain malformed requests, which
  caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations where
  mod_proxy is used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could cause
  mod_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ Protocol)
  servers for the retry timeout period (60 seconds by default) by sending
  specially-crafted requests. (CVE-2010-0408)

  A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the way the Apache HTTP Server
  handled request headers in subrequests. In configurations where subrequests
  are used, a multithreaded MPM (Multi-Processing Module) could possibly leak
  information from other requests in request replies. (CVE-2010-0434)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * with the updated openssl packages from RHSA-2010:0162 or RHSA-2010:0163
  installed, mod_ssl will refuse to renegotiate a TLS/SSL connection with an
  unpatched client that does not support RFC 5746. This update adds the
  "SSLInsecureRenegotiation" configuration directive. If this directive is
  enabled, mod_ssl will renegotiate insecurely with unpatched clients.

  Refer to the following Red Hat Knowledgebase article for more details about
  the changed mod_ssl behavior: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 should upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues
  and add this enhancement. After installing the updated packages, Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 users must restart the httpd22 service, and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 users must restart the httpd service, for the update to
  take effect.
