summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix multiple security issues are
  now available for Red Hat OpenStack Essex.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Keystone is a Python implementation of the OpenStack
  (http://www.openstack.org) identity service API.

  It was found that Keystone incorrectly handled authorization failures. If
  a client attempted to change their tenant membership to one they are not
  authorized to join, Keystone correctly returned a not authorized error;
  however, the client was still added to the tenant. Users able to access the
  Keystone administrative API could use this flaw to add any user to any
  tenant. (CVE-2012-3542)

  When logging into Keystone, the user receives a token to use for
  authentication with other services managed by Keystone. It was found that
  Keystone failed to revoke tokens if privileges were revoked, allowing users
  to retain access to resources they should no longer be able to access while
  their token remains valid. (CVE-2012-4413)

  It was found that the Keystone administrative API was missing
  authentication for certain actions. Users able to access the Keystone
  administrative API could use this flaw to add, start, and stop services, as
  well as list the roles for any user. (CVE-2012-4456)

  It was found that Keystone incorrectly handled disabled tenants. A user
  belonging to a disabled tenant could use this flaw to continue accessing
  resources as if the tenant were not disabled. (CVE-2012-4457)

  Red Hat would like to thank Dolph Mathews for reporting CVE-2012-3542 and
  CVE-2012-4413.

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which upgrade openstack-keystone to upstream version 2012.1.2
  and correct these issues. After installing the updated packages, the
  Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted automatically.
