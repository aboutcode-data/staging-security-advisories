  - CVE-2013-4282
summary: |
  Updated qspice packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a
  virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with
  network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
  viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
  (KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the
  reds_handle_ticket() function in the spice-server library handled
  decryption of ticket data provided by the client. A remote user able to
  initiate a SPICE connection to an application acting as a SPICE server
  could use this flaw to crash the application. (CVE-2013-4282)

  This issue was discovered by Tomas Jamrisko of Red Hat.

  All qspice users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
