  - CVE-2006-7108
summary: |
  An updated util-linux package that corrects a security issue and fixes
  several bugs is now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The util-linux package contains a collection of basic system utilities.

  A flaw was found in the way the login process handled logins which did not
  require authentication. Certain processes which conduct their own
  authentication could allow a remote user to bypass intended access policies
  which would normally be enforced by the login process. (CVE-2006-7108)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The partx, addpart and delpart commands were not documented.

  * The "umount -l" command did not work on hung NFS mounts with cached data.

  * The mount command did not mount NFS V3 share where sec=none was specified.

  * The mount command did not read filesystem LABEL from unpartitioned disks.

  * The mount command did not recognize labels on VFAT filesystems.

  * The fdisk command did not support 4096 sector size for the "-b" option.

  * The mount man page did not list option "mand" or information about
  /etc/mtab limitations.

  All users of util-linux should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
