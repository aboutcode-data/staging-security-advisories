summary: "Updated mysql packages that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 6.\n\nMySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of the\
  \ MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.\n\nThis update fixes\
  \ the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the mysqld daemon worked with uninitialized\
  \ memory when accessing non-nullable GEOMETRY types. Cosequenutly, mysqld could terminate\
  \ unexpectedly when the mysqldump utility was running. With this update, mysqld initializes\
  \ memory properly and thus no longer crashes in this scenario (BZ#842052)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ the mysqldump utility expected log tables to be created on the MySQL 5.0.x server, from\
  \ which it retrieved data. Consequently, mysqldump could not dump the MySQL system table.\
  \ With this update, mysqldump no longer expects log tables to be created, and it is now able\
  \ to dump the system table in the described scenario as expected. (BZ#877557) \n\n* Prior\
  \ to this update, the mysqld init script did not correctly verify the status of the mysqld\
  \ daemon. Consequently, the script could return an error message even when the daemon had\
  \ successfully started. The mysqld init script has been fixed, and it now checks the daemon\
  \ status properly. (BZ#884651) \n\n* Previously, the mysql-server sub-packages did not contain\
  \ the logrotate script. Consequently, the log rotation had to be configured manually. With\
  \ this update, the logrotate script has been provided by the mysql-server sub-packages, and\
  \ users can use the script to log into the mysqld.log file by uncommenting appropriate lines\
  \ in the script. (BZ#904061)\n\nUsers of mysql are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\
  \ which fix these bugs. After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will\
  \ be restarted automatically."
