  - CVE-2013-6466
summary: |
  Updated openswan packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Openswan is a free implementation of Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and
  Internet Key Exchange (IKE). IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide both
  authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to build
  secure tunnels through untrusted networks.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the way Openswan's IKE
  daemon processed IKEv2 payloads. A remote attacker could send specially
  crafted IKEv2 payloads that, when processed, would lead to a denial of
  service (daemon crash), possibly causing existing VPN connections to be
  dropped. (CVE-2013-6466)

  All openswan users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
