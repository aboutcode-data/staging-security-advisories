summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the openssl_x509_parse()
  function of the PHP openssl extension parsed X.509 certificates. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to provide a malicious self-signed certificate
  or a certificate signed by a trusted authority to a PHP application using
  the aforementioned function, causing the application to crash or, possibly,
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the PHP interpreter. (CVE-2013-6420)

  It was found that PHP did not check for carriage returns in HTTP headers,
  allowing intended HTTP response splitting protections to be bypassed.
  Depending on the web browser the victim is using, a remote attacker could
  use this flaw to perform HTTP response splitting attacks. (CVE-2011-1398)

  An integer signedness issue, leading to a heap-based buffer underflow, was
  found in the PHP scandir() function. If a remote attacker could upload an
  excessively large number of files to a directory the scandir() function
  runs on, it could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2688)

  It was found that the PHP SOAP parser allowed the expansion of external XML
  entities during SOAP message parsing. A remote attacker could possibly use
  this flaw to read arbitrary files that are accessible to a PHP application
  using a SOAP extension. (CVE-2013-1643)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PHP project for reporting CVE-2013-6420.
  Upstream acknowledges Stefan Esser as the original reporter.

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
