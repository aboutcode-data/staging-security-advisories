summary: |
  Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the way in which Thunderbird processed certain
  malformed HTML mail content. An HTML mail message containing malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or potentially execute arbitrary
  code as the user running Thunderbird. JavaScript support is disabled by
  default in Thunderbird; these issues are not exploitable unless the user
  has enabled JavaScript.  (CVE-2007-5338, CVE-2007-5339, CVE-2007-5340)

  Several flaws were found in the way in which Thunderbird displayed
  malformed HTML mail content. An HTML mail message containing
  specially-crafted content could potentially trick a user into surrendering
  sensitive information.  (CVE-2007-1095, CVE-2007-3844, CVE-2007-3511,
  CVE-2007-5334)

  A flaw was found in the Thunderbird sftp protocol handler. A malicious HTML
  mail message could access data from a remote sftp site, possibly stealing
  sensitive user data. (CVE-2007-5337)

  A request-splitting flaw was found in the way in which Thunderbird
  generates a digest authentication request. If a user opened a
  specially-crafted URL, it was possible to perform cross-site scripting
  attacks, web cache poisoning, or other, similar exploits. (CVE-2007-2292)

  Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages,
  which contain backported patches that correct these issues.
