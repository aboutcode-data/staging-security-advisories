summary: |
  An update for curl is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the libcurl library did not prevent TLS session resumption when the client certificate had changed. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate. (CVE-2016-5419)

  * It was found that the libcurl library did not check the client certificate when choosing the TLS connection to reuse. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate. (CVE-2016-5420)

  * It was found that the libcurl library using the NSS (Network Security Services) library as TLS/SSL backend incorrectly re-used client certificates for subsequent TLS connections in certain cases. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate. (CVE-2016-7141)
