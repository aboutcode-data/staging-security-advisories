summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled
  simultaneous connections between the same hosts. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-5077, Important)

  * Multiple use-after-free flaws and an integer overflow flaw were found in
  the way the Linux kernel's Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)
  implementation handled user controls. A local, privileged user could use
  either of these flaws to crash the system. (CVE-2014-4653, CVE-2014-4654,
  CVE-2014-4655, CVE-2014-4656, Moderate)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Advanced
  Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled access of the user
  control's state. A local, privileged user could use this flaw to leak
  kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2014-4652, Low)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, the netconsole module was unavailable on MRG
  Realtime kernels due to locking issues that disabled it. These locking
  issues have been corrected, allowing the netconsole module to be re-enabled
  and functional on Realtime kernels. (BZ#1088923)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the
  kernel-rt kernel to version kernel-rt-3.10.33-rt32.45 and correct these
  issues. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
