  - CVE-2007-2446
  - CVE-2007-2447
summary: "Updated samba packages that fix several security flaws are now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nSamba provides file and printer sharing services to SMB/CIFS clients.\n\nVarious\
  \ bugs were found in NDR parsing, used to decode MS-RPC requests in\nSamba.  A remote attacker\
  \ could have sent carefully crafted requests\ncausing a heap overflow, which may have led\
  \ to the ability to execute\narbitrary code on the server.  (CVE-2007-2446)\n\nUnescaped user\
  \ input parameters were being passed as arguments to /bin/sh.\nA remote, authenticated, user\
  \ could have triggered this flaw and executed\narbitrary code on the server.  Additionally,\
  \ on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\nonly, this flaw could be triggered by a remote unauthenticated\
  \ user if\nSamba was configured to use the non-default \"username map script\" option. \n\
  (CVE-2007-2447)\n\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these packages, which contain backported\n\
  patches to correct these issues.  After upgrading, Samba should be\nrestarted using \"service\
  \ smb restart\"\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 the impact of these issues is reduced as\n\
  Samba is constrained by the default SELinux \"targeted\" policy.\n\nRed Hat would like to\
  \ thank the Samba developers, TippingPoint, and\niDefense for reporting these issues."
