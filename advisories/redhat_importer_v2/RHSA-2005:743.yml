  - CVE-2005-2471
summary: |
  Updated netpbm packages that fix a security issue are now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The netpbm package contains a library of functions that support
  programs for handling various graphics file formats, including .pbm
  (portable bitmaps), .pgm (portable graymaps), .pnm (portable anymaps),
  .ppm (portable pixmaps) and others.

  A bug was found in the way netpbm converts PostScript files into PBM, PGM
  or PPM files.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted PostScript file
  in such a way that it could execute arbitrary commands when the
  file is processed by a victim using pstopnm.  The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project assigned the name CAN-2005-2471 to this issue.

  All users of netpbm should upgrade to the updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
