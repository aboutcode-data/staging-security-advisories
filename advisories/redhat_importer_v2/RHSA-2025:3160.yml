summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform provides an enterprise framework for building, deploying and managing IT automation at scale. IT Managers can provide top-down guidelines on how automation is applied to individual teams, while automation developers retain the freedom to write tasks that leverage existing knowledge without the overhead. Ansible Automation Platform makes it possible for users across an organization to share, vet, and manage automation content by means of a simple, powerful, and agentless language.

  Security Fix(es):

  * automation-controller: Jinja sandbox breakout through attr filter selecting format method (CVE-2025-27516)

  * python3.11-jinja2: Jinja sandbox breakout through attr filter selecting format method (CVE-2025-27516)

  * python3.11-django: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in django.utils.text.wrap() (CVE-2025-26699)
