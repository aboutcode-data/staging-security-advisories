summary: "Updated openstack-swift packages that fix two security issues are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for RHEL 6.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having Moderate \nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base \nscore, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\
  \ \nCVE link in the References section.\n\nOpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object\
  \ storage in virtual\ncontainers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary\n\
  data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;\nredundancy as\
  \ failure-proofing is provided through software-based data\nreplication. Because Object Storage\
  \ supports asynchronous eventual\nconsistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center\n\
  deployment.\n\nA memory-leak issue was found in OpenStack Object Storage (swift), in the\n\
  proxy-to-server connection. An OpenStack-authenticated attacker could\nremotely trigger this\
  \ flaw to cause denial of service through excess memory\nconsumption. (CVE-2016-0738)\n\n\
  A memory-leak issue was found in OpenStack Object Storage (swift), in the\nclient-to-proxy\
  \ connection. An OpenStack-authenticated attacker could\nremotely trigger this flaw to cause\
  \ denial of service through excess memory\nconsumption. (CVE-2016-0737)\n\nRed Hat would like\
  \ to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these \nissues. Upstream acknowledges Romain\
  \ Le Disez from OVH and Örjan Persson\nfrom Kiliaro as the original reporters.\n\nAll users\
  \ of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these\
  \ issues. After installing this update, the\nOpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted\
  \ automatically."
