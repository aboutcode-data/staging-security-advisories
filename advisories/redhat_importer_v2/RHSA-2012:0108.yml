  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Cache is the clustering backbone for data distribution in JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform. It provides the backing implementation
  for web session replication, stateful session bean replication and entity
  caching.

  It was found that NonManagedConnectionFactory would log the username and
  password in plain text when an exception was thrown. This could lead to the
  exposure of authentication credentials if local users had permissions to
  read the log file. (CVE-2012-0034)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform's
  "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/lib/jbosscache-core.jar" file.
