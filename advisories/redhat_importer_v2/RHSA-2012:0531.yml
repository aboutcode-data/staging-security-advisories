summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes three security issues and
  one bug is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way libtasn1 decoded DER data. An attacker could
  create carefully-crafted DER encoded input (such as an X.509 certificate)
  that, when parsed by an application that uses libtasn1 (such as
  applications using GnuTLS), could cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2012-1569)

  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS decrypted malformed TLS records. This
  could cause a TLS/SSL client or server to crash when processing a
  specially-crafted TLS record from a remote TLS/SSL connection peer.
  (CVE-2012-1573)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the implementation of the printf
  functions family. This could allow an attacker to bypass FORTIFY_SOURCE
  protections and execute arbitrary code using a format string flaw in an
  application, even though these protections are expected to limit the
  impact of such flaws to an application abort. (CVE-2012-0864)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Hall of Mu Dynamics for reporting
  CVE-2012-1569 and CVE-2012-1573.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2011-4128 (gnutls issue)

  CVE-2012-0879, CVE-2012-1090, and CVE-2012-1097 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2012-0884 and CVE-2012-1165 (openssl issues)

  CVE-2012-0060, CVE-2012-0061, and CVE-2012-0815 (rpm issues)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The Hypervisor previously set the lro_disable option for the enic driver.
  The driver does not support this option, as a result the Hypervisor did
  not correctly detect and configure the network interfaces of a Cisco M81KR
  adaptor, when present. The Hypervisor has been updated and no longer sets
  the invalid option for this driver. (BZ#809463)

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.
