aliases:
  - CVE-2012-0878
summary: |
  An updated python-paste-script package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Python Paste provides middleware for building and running Python web
  applications. The python-paste-script package includes paster, a tool for
  working with and running Python Paste applications.

  It was discovered that paster did not drop supplementary group privileges
  when started by the root user. Running "paster serve" as root to start a
  Python web application that will run as a non-root user and group resulted
  in that application running with root group privileges. This could possibly
  allow a remote attacker to gain access to files that should not be
  accessible to the application. (CVE-2012-0878)

  All paster users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. All running paster instances
  configured to drop privileges must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
