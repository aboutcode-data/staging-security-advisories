summary: "Updated krb5 packages that fix a number of issues are now available.\n\nThis update\
  \ has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\
  \nKerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and\nservers to authenticate\
  \ to each other through use of symmetric encryption\nand a trusted third party, the KDC.\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the username handling of the MIT krb5 telnet daemon\n(telnetd).  A remote\
  \ attacker who can access the telnet port of a target\nmachine could log in as root without\
  \ requiring a password.  (CVE-2007-0956)\n\nNote that the krb5 telnet daemon is not enabled\
  \ by default in any version\nof Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  In addition, the default firewall\
  \ rules block\nremote access to the telnet port.  This flaw does not affect the telnet\ndaemon\
  \ distributed in the telnet-server package.\n\nFor users who have enabled the krb5 telnet\
  \ daemon and have it accessible\nremotely, this update should be applied immediately.  \n\n\
  Whilst we are not aware at this time that the flaw is being actively\nexploited, we have confirmed\
  \ that the flaw is very easily exploitable.\n\nThis update also fixes two additional security\
  \ issues:\n\nBuffer overflows were found which affect the Kerberos KDC and the kadmin\nserver\
  \ daemon.  A remote attacker who can access the KDC could exploit this\nbug to run arbitrary\
  \ code with the privileges of the KDC or kadmin server\nprocesses.  (CVE-2007-0957)\n\nA double-free\
  \ flaw was found in the GSSAPI library used by the kadmin\nserver daemon.  Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 4 and 5 contain checks within\nglibc that detect double-free flaws. Therefore, on\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n4 and 5 successful exploitation of this issue can only lead to\
  \ a denial of\nservice.  Applications which use this library in earlier releases of Red\n\
  Hat Enterprise Linux may also be affected.  (CVE-2007-1216)\n\nAll users are advised to update\
  \ to these erratum packages which contain a\nbackported fix to correct these issues.\n\nRed\
  \ Hat would like to thank MIT and iDefense for reporting these\nvulnerabilities."
