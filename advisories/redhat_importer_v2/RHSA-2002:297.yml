summary: "Updated vim packages are now available for Red Hat Linux.  These \nupdates resolve\
  \ a security issue when opening a specially crafted text \nfile.\n\n[Updated 16 April 2003]\n\
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.\n\nVIM (Vi IMproved)\
  \ is a version of the vi editor.  \n \nVIM allows a user to set the modeline differently for\
  \ each edited text \nfile by placing special comments in the files.  Georgi Guninski found\
  \ that\nthese comments can be carefully crafted in order to call external programs.\n This\
  \ could allow an attacker to create a text file such that when it is\nopened arbitrary commands\
  \ are executed.   \n\nUsers of VIM are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which have\
  \ \nbeen patched to disable the usage of dangerous functions in modelines."
