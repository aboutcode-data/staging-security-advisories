  - CVE-2002-1563
summary: "Updated stunnel packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3,\nand 8.0.\
  \  These updates correct a potential vulnerability in stunnel's\nsignal handling.\n\nStunnel\
  \ is a wrapper for network connections.  It can be used to tunnel an\nunencrypted network\
  \ connection over a secure connection (encrypted using\nSSL or TLS) or to provide a secure\
  \ means of connecting to services that do\nnot natively support encryption.\n\nWhen configured\
  \ to listen for incoming connections (instead of being\ninvoked by xinetd), stunnel can be\
  \ configured to either start a thread or a\nchild process to handle each new connection. If\
  \ Stunnel is configured to\nstart a new child process to handle each connection, it will receive\
  \ a\nSIGCHLD signal when that child exits. \n\nStunnel versions prior to 4.04 would perform\
  \ tasks in the SIGCHLD signal\nhandler which, if interrupted by another SIGCHLD signal, could\
  \ be unsafe.\nThis could lead to a denial of service.\n\nAll users are urged to upgrade to\
  \ these errata packages, which modify\nstunnel's signal handler so that it is not vulnerable\
  \ to this issue.\n\nNOTE: After upgrading, any instances of stunnel configured to run in daemon\n\
  mode should be restarted, and any active network connections that are\ncurrently being serviced\
  \ by stunnel should be terminated and reestablished."
