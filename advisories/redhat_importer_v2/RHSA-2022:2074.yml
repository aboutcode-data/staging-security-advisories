summary: |
  An update for samba is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the related Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allow PC-compatible machines to share files, printers, and various information.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: samba (4.15.5). (BZ#2013596)

  Security Fix(es):

  * samba: Symlink race error can allow metadata read and modify outside of the exported share (CVE-2021-20316)

  * samba: Information leak via symlinks of existance of files or directories outside of the exported share (CVE-2021-44141)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
