  - CVE-2013-4449
summary: |
  Updated openldap packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenLDAP is an open source suite of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
  (LDAP) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of protocols used
  to access and maintain distributed directory information services over an
  IP network. The openldap package contains configuration files, libraries,
  and documentation for OpenLDAP.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the OpenLDAP server daemon
  (slapd) performed reference counting when using the rwm (rewrite/remap)
  overlay. A remote attacker able to query the OpenLDAP server could use this
  flaw to crash the server by immediately unbinding from the server after
  sending a search request. (CVE-2013-4449)

  Red Hat would like to thank Michael Vishchers from Seven Principles AG for
  reporting this issue.

  All openldap users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
