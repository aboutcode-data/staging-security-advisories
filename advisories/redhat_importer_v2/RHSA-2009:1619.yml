  - CVE-2009-3894
summary: |
  An updated dstat package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Dstat is a versatile replacement for the vmstat, iostat, and netstat tools.
  Dstat can be used for performance tuning tests, benchmarks, and
  troubleshooting.

  Robert Buchholz of the Gentoo Security Team reported a flaw in the Python
  module search path used in dstat. If a local attacker could trick a
  local user into running dstat from a directory containing a Python script
  that is named like an importable module, they could execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running dstat. (CVE-2009-3894)

  All dstat users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
