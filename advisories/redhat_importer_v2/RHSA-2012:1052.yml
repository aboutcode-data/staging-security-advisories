  - CVE-2012-1154
summary: |
  Updated mod_cluster packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  mod_cluster is an Apache HTTP Server (httpd) based load balancer that
  forwards requests from httpd to application server nodes. It can use the
  AJP, HTTP, or HTTPS protocols for communication with application server
  nodes.

  The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 release (RHSA-2011:1800,
  RHSA-2011:1799, RHSA-2011:1798) introduced a regression, causing
  mod_cluster to register and expose the root context of a server by default,
  even when "ROOT" was in the "excludedContexts" list in the mod_cluster
  configuration. If an application was deployed on the root context, a remote
  attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended access restrictions and
  gain access to that application. (CVE-2012-1154)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along with all
  other customized configuration files.

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4, 5, and 6 should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  this issue. The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
