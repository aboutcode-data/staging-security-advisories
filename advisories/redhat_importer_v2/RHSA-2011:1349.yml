  - CVE-2011-3378
summary: |
  Updated rpm packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
  Extended Life Cycle Support, 5.3 Long Life, 5.6 Extended Update Support,
  and 6.0 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a command line driven package management
  system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and
  updating software packages.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way the RPM library parsed package
  headers. An attacker could create a specially-crafted RPM package that,
  when queried or installed, would cause rpm to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3378)

  Note: Although an RPM package can, by design, execute arbitrary code when
  installed, this issue would allow a specially-crafted RPM package to
  execute arbitrary code before its digital signature has been verified.
  Package downloads from the Red Hat Network remain secure due to certificate
  checks performed on the secure connection.

  All RPM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues. All running applications linked
  against the RPM library must be restarted for this update to take effect.
