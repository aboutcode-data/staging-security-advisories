  - CVE-2003-0689
summary: "Updated glibc packages that fix a number of bugs as well as a buffer\noverflow issue\
  \ are now available.\n\nThe GNU libc package (known as glibc) contains the standard C libraries\n\
  used by applications.\n\nA bug in the getgrouplist function can cause a buffer overflow if\
  \ \nthe size of the group list is too small to hold all the user's groups. \nThis overflow\
  \ can cause segmentation faults in user applications, which may\nhave security implications,\
  \ depending on the application in question. This\nvulnerability exists only when an administrator\
  \ has placed a user in a\nnumber of groups larger than that expected by an application.  Therefore,\n\
  there is no risk in instances where users are members of few groups.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0689 to this issue.\n\
  \nIn addition, a number of other bugs in glibc have been fixed:\n                  \n- An\
  \ error prevented gdb from correctly debugging programs linked to\nlibpthread.           \
  \                                                    \n     \n- A race condition existed in\
  \ the malloc routine for IA64 platforms, which\ncould cause memory corruption.\n\n- An error\
  \ in pthread_spinlocks prevents spinlocks from functioning\ncorrectly on IA64 platforms.\n\
  \nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which contain patches to\nthe glibc libraries\
  \ correcting these issues."
