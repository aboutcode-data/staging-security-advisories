summary: |
  An update for the Apache HTTP Server component of Red Hat JBoss Web Server
  2.0.1 that fixes two security issues and one bug is now available from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, Solaris, and
  Microsoft Windows.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  It was found that the mod_dav module did not correctly strip leading white
  space from certain elements in a parsed XML. In certain httpd
  configurations that use the mod_dav module (for example when using the
  mod_dav_svn module), a remote attacker could send a specially crafted DAV
  request that would cause the httpd child process to crash or, possibly,
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  "apache" user. (CVE-2013-6438)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the httpd mod_log_config module.
  In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote attacker could
  use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP request with a
  malformed cookie header. (CVE-2014-0098)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  It was discovered that the mod_log_config module, which provides logging of
  client requests, truncated cookie values at the first occurrence of an
  equal sign ('=') when using the "%{abc}C" syntax in a LogFormat definition.
  (ASF Bug 53104)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Apache HTTP Server
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
