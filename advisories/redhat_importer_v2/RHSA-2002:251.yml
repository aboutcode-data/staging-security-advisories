summary: "Updated apache and httpd packages are available which fix a number of\nsecurity issues\
  \ for Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1.\n\n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded fixed packages for\
  \ Advanced Workstation 2.1\n\nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient,\
  \ and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nBuffer overflows in the ApacheBench support program\
  \ (ab.c) in Apache\nversions prior to 1.3.27 allow a malicious Web server to cause a denial\
  \ of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long response.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0843 to this issue.\n\nTwo cross-site\
  \ scripting vulnerabilities are present in the error pages\nfor the default \"404 Not Found\"\
  \ error, and for the error response when a\nplain HTTP request is received on an SSL port.\
  \ Both of these issues are\nonly exploitable if the \"UseCanonicalName\" setting has been\
  \ changed to\n\"Off\", and wildcard DNS is in use.  These issues would allow remote\nattackers\
  \ to execute scripts as other Web page visitors, for instance, to\nsteal cookies. These issues\
  \ affect versions of Apache 1.3 before 1.3.26,\nand versions of mod_ssl before 2.8.12. The\
  \ Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the names CAN-2002-0840 and CAN-2002-1157\
  \ to\nthese issues.\n\nThe shared memory scoreboard in the HTTP daemon for Apache 1.3, prior\
  \ to\nversion 1.3.27, allowed a user running as the \"apache\" UID to send a\nSIGUSR1 signal\
  \ to any process as root, resulting in a denial of service\n(process kill) or other such behavior\
  \ that would not normally be allowed. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has\
  \ assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0839 to this issue. \n\nAll users of the Apache HTTP server\
  \ are advised to upgrade to the\napplicable errata packages.  For Red Hat Linux Advanced Server\
  \ 2.1 these\npackages include Apache version 1.3.27 which is not vulnerable to\nthese issues.\n\
  \nNote that the instructions in the \"Solution\" section of this errata contain\nadditional\
  \ steps required to complete the upgrade process."
