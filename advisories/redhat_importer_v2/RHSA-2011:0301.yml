summary: |
  Updated acroread packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extras and Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Adobe Reader allows users to view and print documents in Portable Document
  Format (PDF).

  This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader. These
  vulnerabilities are detailed on the Adobe security page APSB11-03, listed
  in the References section.

  A specially-crafted PDF file could cause Adobe Reader to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Adobe Reader when
  opened. (CVE-2011-0562, CVE-2011-0563, CVE-2011-0565, CVE-2011-0566,
  CVE-2011-0567, CVE-2011-0585, CVE-2011-0586, CVE-2011-0589, CVE-2011-0590,
  CVE-2011-0591, CVE-2011-0592, CVE-2011-0593, CVE-2011-0594, CVE-2011-0595,
  CVE-2011-0596, CVE-2011-0598, CVE-2011-0599, CVE-2011-0600, CVE-2011-0602,
  CVE-2011-0603, CVE-2011-0606)

  Multiple security flaws were found in Adobe reader. A specially-crafted PDF
  file could cause cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against the user
  running Adobe Reader when opened. (CVE-2011-0587, CVE-2011-0604)

  All Adobe Reader users should install these updated packages. They contain
  Adobe Reader version 9.4.2, which is not vulnerable to these issues. All
  running instances of Adobe Reader must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
