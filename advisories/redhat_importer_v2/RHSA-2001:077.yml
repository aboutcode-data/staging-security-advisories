  - CVE-2001-0787
summary: |
  When LPRng drops uid and gid, it fails to drop membership in its
  supplemental groups.

  LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership at init time, though it
  does properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its
  children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process starting LPRng
  had at the time it started LPRng. This is a security risk.
