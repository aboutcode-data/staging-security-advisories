summary: |
  Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues and one
  bug are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Chromium. (CVE-2015-1243, CVE-2015-1250)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, Chromium did not accept GNOME's system proxy
  settings due to having GConf support disabled. This issue has been resolved
  in this update. (BZ#1217065)

  All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Chromium version 42.0.2311.135, which corrects these issues. After
  installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
  effect.
