  - CVE-2023-4863
summary: |
  An updated rhel9/thunderbird-flatpak container image is now available in the Red Hat container registry.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Flatpak is a system for running graphical applications as containers. Installing an application as a Flatpak rather than as an individual package allows it to be installed and updated independently of the host operating system.

  This updates the rhel9/thunderbird-flatpak image of Thunderbird in the Red Hat container registry.
