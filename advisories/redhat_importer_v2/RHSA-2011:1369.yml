  - CVE-2011-3192
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Application Stack v2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

  A flaw was found in the way the Apache HTTP Server handled Range HTTP
  headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd to use an
  excessive amount of memory and CPU time via HTTP requests with a
  specially-crafted Range header. (CVE-2011-3192)

  All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
