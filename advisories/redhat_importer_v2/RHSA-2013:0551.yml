  Updated acroread packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Adobe Reader allows users to view and print documents in Portable Document
  Format (PDF).

  This update fixes two security flaws in Adobe Reader. These flaws are
  detailed in the Adobe Security bulletin APSB13-07, listed in the References
  section. A specially-crafted PDF file could cause Adobe Reader to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Adobe Reader when
  opened. (CVE-2013-0640, CVE-2013-0641)

  All Adobe Reader users should install these updated packages. They contain
  Adobe Reader version 9.5.4, which is not vulnerable to these issues. All
  running instances of Adobe Reader must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
