summary: |
  An updated redhat-ds-admin package that fixes security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Directory Server 8.0.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Administration Server is an HTTP agent that provides management
  features for Red Hat Directory Server, an LDAPv3 compliant server.

  A shell command injection flaw was discovered in the Red Hat Administration
  Server replication monitor CGI script used by Red Hat Directory Server 8.0.
  An attacker with access to the replication monitor web page could execute
  arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the Administration Server.
  Please Note: by default, the Red Hat Administration Server is run as the
  unprivileged user, "nobody". (CVE-2008-0892)

  It was discovered that the Red Hat Administration Server did to properly
  restrict access to CGI scripts. An unauthenticated remote user with access
  to the TCP port used by the Administration Server could access information
  or perform certain tasks that should have been restricted to Directory
  Server administrative users. Please note: by default the Red Hat
  Administration Server uses port 9830, although this can be changed by the
  Red Hat Directory Server administrator. (CVE-2008-0893)

  In combination, these two flaws allowed an unauthenticated remote attacker
  able to access the Red Hat Administration Server TCP port to run arbitrary
  code as the user "nobody".

  All users of Red Hat Directory Server should upgrade to this updated
  package, which addresses these vulnerabilities.
