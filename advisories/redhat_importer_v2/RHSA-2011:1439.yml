  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled certain add-ons. Malicious,
  remote content could cause an add-on to elevate its privileges, which could
  lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3647)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled
  certain multibyte character sets. Malicious, remote content could cause
  Thunderbird to run JavaScript code with the permissions of different
  remote content. (CVE-2011-3648)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled large JavaScript scripts.
  Malicious, remote content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
