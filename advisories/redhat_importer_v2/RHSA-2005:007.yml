  - CVE-2004-1027
summary: |
  An updated unarj package that fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability and a
  directory traversal vulnerability is now available.

  The unarj program is an archiving utility which can extract ARJ-compatible
  archives.

  A buffer overflow bug was discovered in unarj when handling long file
  names contained in an archive.  An attacker could create a specially
  crafted archive which could cause unarj to crash or possibly execute
  arbitrary code when extracted by a victim.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0947 to
  this issue.

  Additionally, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in unarj.  An
  attacker could create a specially crafted archive which would create files
  in the parent ("..") directory when extracted by a victim.  When used
  recursively, this vulnerability could be used to overwrite critical system
  files and programs.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1027 to this issue.

  Users of unarj should upgrade to this updated package which contains
  backported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.
