summary: |
  [Updated September 30, 2014]
  This advisory has been updated with information on restarting system
  services after applying this update. No changes have been made to the
  original packages.

  Updated bash packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support, Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support,
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The GNU Bourne Again shell (Bash) is a shell and command language
  interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell (sh). Bash is the default
  shell for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-6271 was incomplete, and Bash still
  allowed certain characters to be injected into other environments via
  specially crafted environment variables. An attacker could potentially use
  this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell
  commands. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated
  attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this
  issue. (CVE-2014-7169)

  Applications which directly create bash functions as environment variables
  need to be made aware of changes to the way names are handled by this
  update. Note that certain services, screen sessions, and tmux sessions may
  need to be restarted, and affected interactive users may need to re-login.
  Installing these updated packages without restarting services will address
  the vulnerability, but functionality may be impacted until affected
  services are restarted. For more information see the Knowledgebase article
  at https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223

  Note: Docker users are advised to use "yum update" within their containers,
  and to commit the resulting changes.

  For additional information on CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, refer to the
  aforementioned Knowledgebase article.

  All bash users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
