  - CVE-2008-1677
summary: |
  An updated redhat-ds-base package that fixes a security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Directory Server 8.0.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The redhat-ds-base
  package includes the LDAP server and command line utilities for server
  administration.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Red Hat Directory Server 8.0
  regular expression handler. An unauthenticated attacker could construct a
  malicious LDAP query that could cause the LDAP server to crash, or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-1677)

  All users of Red Hat Directory Server should upgrade to this updated
  package, which resolves this issue.
