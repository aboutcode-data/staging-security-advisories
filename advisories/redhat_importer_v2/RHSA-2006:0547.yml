  - CVE-2006-2842
summary: "An updated squirrelmail package that fixes a local file disclosure flaw is\nnow available.\n\
  \nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nSquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.\n\nA local file\
  \ disclosure flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail loads\nplugins. In SquirrelMail 1.4.6\
  \ or earlier, if register_globals is on and\nmagic_quotes_gpc is off, it became possible for\
  \ an unauthenticated remote\nuser to view the contents of arbitrary local files the web server\
  \ has\nread-access to. This configuration is neither default nor safe, and\nconfiguring PHP\
  \ with the register_globals set on is dangerous and not\nrecommended.  (CVE-2006-2842) \n\n\
  Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this erratum package, which\ncontains a backported\
  \ patch to correct this issue."
