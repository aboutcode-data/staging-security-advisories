  - CVE-2014-1491
summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue is now
  available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  It was found that NSS accepted weak Diffie-Hellman Key exchange (DHKE)
  parameters. This could possibly lead to weak encryption being used in
  communication between the client and the server. (CVE-2014-1491)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting the
  CVE-2014-1491 issue. Upstream acknowledges Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and
  Karthikeyan Bhargavan as the original reporters of CVE-2014-1491.

  This update includes changes to the rhev-hypervisor component:

  * The most recent build of rhev-hypervisor is included in version 3.4.1.
  (BZ#1118298)

  This updated package also provides updated components that include fixes
  for various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red
  Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security
  fixes included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2014-4699 and CVE-2014-4943 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2014-4607 (lzo issue)

  CVE-2013-1740, CVE-2014-1490, CVE-2014-1492, CVE-2014-1545, and
  CVE-2014-1544 (nss and nspr issues)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package.
