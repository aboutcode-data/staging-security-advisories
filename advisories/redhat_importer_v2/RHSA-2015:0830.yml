  - CVE-2015-1842
summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Installer packages that
  fix one security issue and several bugs are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise OpenStack Platform Installer is a deployment management
  tool. It provides a web user interface for managing the installation and
  configuration of remote systems. Deployment of changes is performed using
  Puppet. Additionally, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain
  Name System (DNS), Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), and Trivial File
  Transfer Protocol (TFTP) services can be provided. Controlling these
  services also enables provisioning of physical systems that do not yet have
  an operating system installed.

  It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
  openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
  known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
  was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands
  as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

  Note: This flaw only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
  installations deployed using the HA feature set.

  For additional information on addressing this flaw see:
  https://access.redhat.com/articles/1396123

  This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

  The augeas package has been upgraded to version 1.0.0-7, which provides a
  number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1198236)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * A problem with cloned constraints for neutron caused RHEL OpenStack
  Platform deployments to fail. This update corrects the cloned constraints,
  and deployments are now successful. (BZ#1209628)

  All Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Installer users are advised
  to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.
