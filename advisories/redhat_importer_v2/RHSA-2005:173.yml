  - CVE-2005-0446
summary: "Updated squid packages that fix a denial of service issue are now available.\n\nThis\
  \ update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team\n\nSquid is a full-featured Web proxy cache.  \n  \nA bug was found in the way Squid\
  \ handles FQDN lookups.  It was possible  \nto crash the Squid server by sending a carefully\
  \ crafted DNS response to  \nan FQDN lookup.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \  \n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0446 to this issue.  \n  \nUsers of squid\
  \ should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a  \nbackported patch, and is not\
  \ vulnerable to this issue."
