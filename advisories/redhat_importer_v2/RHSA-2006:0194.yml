  - CVE-2004-0941
summary: "Updated gd packages that fix several buffer overflow flaws are now available.\n\n\
  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nThe gd package contains a graphics library used for the dynamic creation of\nimages\
  \ such as PNG and JPEG.\n\nSeveral buffer overflow flaws were found in the way gd allocates\
  \ memory. \nAn attacker could create a carefully crafted image that could execute\narbitrary\
  \ code if opened by a victim using a program linked against the gd\nlibrary.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nassigned the name CVE-2004-0941 to these issues.\n\
  \nUsers of gd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch\
  \ and is not vulnerable to these issues."
