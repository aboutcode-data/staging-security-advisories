  - CVE-2018-10873
summary: |
  An update for spice and spice-gtk is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a remote display system built for virtual environments which allows the user to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.

  The spice-gtk packages provide a GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) widget for Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) clients. Both Virtual Machine Manager and Virtual Machine Viewer can make use of this widget to access virtual machines using the SPICE protocol.

  Security Fix(es):

  * spice: Missing check in demarshal.py:write_validate_array_item() allows for buffer overflow and denial of service (CVE-2018-10873)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  This issue was discovered by Frediano Ziglio (Red Hat).
