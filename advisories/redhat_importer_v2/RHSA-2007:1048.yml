  - CVE-2007-4575
summary: "Updated openoffice.org and hsqldb packages that fix security flaws are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. \n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nOpenOffice.org is an office productivity\
  \ suite.\nHSQLDB is a Java relational database engine used by OpenOffice.org Base.\n\nIt was\
  \ discovered that HSQLDB could allow the execution of arbitrary public\nstatic Java methods.\
  \ A carefully crafted odb file opened in OpenOffice.org\nBase could execute arbitrary commands\
  \ with the permissions of the user\nrunning OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2007-4575)\n\nIt was discovered\
  \ that HSQLDB did not have a password set on the 'sa' user.\n If HSQLDB has been configured\
  \ as a service, a remote attacker who could\nconnect to the HSQLDB port (tcp 9001) could execute\
  \ arbitrary SQL commands.\n(CVE-2003-0845)\n\nNote that in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, HSQLDB\
  \ is not enabled as a service\nby default, and needs manual configuration in order to work\
  \ as a service.\n\nUsers of OpenOffice.org or HSQLDB should update to these errata packages\n\
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues."
