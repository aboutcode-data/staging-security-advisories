  - CVE-2015-7518
summary: "Updated Satellite 6.1 packages that fix one security issue, add one\nenhancement,\
  \ and fix several bugs are available for Satellite 6.1.7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has\
  \ rated this update as having Moderate\nSecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System\
  \ (CVSS) base \nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each \nvulnerability\
  \ from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nRed Hat Satellite is a system management\
  \ solution that allows\norganizations to configure and maintain their systems without the\n\
  necessity to provide public Internet access to their servers or \nother client systems. It\
  \ performs provisioning and configuration \nmanagement of predefined standard operating environments.\n\
  \nA stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the smart \nclass parameters/variables\
  \ field. By sending a specially crafted \nrequest to Satellite, a remote, authenticated attacker\
  \ could embed \nHTML content into the stored data, allowing them to inject malicious \ncontent\
  \ into the web page that is used to view that data. \n(CVE-2015-7518)\n\nThis update also\
  \ fixes the following bugs:\n\n* New subscription rules for developer subscriptions caused\
  \ manifest \nimports into Satellite to fail. The subscription engine has been \nupdated to\
  \ handle these new subscription rules correctly. \n(BZ#1301812)\n\n* A heavy load on content\
  \ synchronization caused tasks to appear as \nif they had not stopped. The content engine\
  \ has been updated to \nhandle these messages with varying amounts of load. (BZ#1300811)\n\
  \n* Deleted directories in the /var/lib/pulp/ directory caused errors \nrelated to \"missing\
  \ symlinks\" during content synchronization. The \ncode has been updated to notice deleted\
  \ directories, and recreate \nthem as necessary. (BZ#1288855, BZ#1276911)\n\n* The networking\
  \ API returned a JSON output which did not contain \nthe identifier of the interface. This\
  \ data is critical for \nscripting, and has been added to the API response. (BZ#1282539)\n\
  \n* When provisioning against Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization \n(RHEV), the operating system\
  \ information was not passed, causing \nprovisioning to fail. The interface to RHEV has been\
  \ updated to \nresolve this bug. (BZ#1279631)\n\n* Incremental updates initiated from the\
  \ command line were failing \nwith an \"ID not found\" error. The command line interface has\
  \ been \npatched to provide the correct ID, thus fixing this bug. \n(BZ#1259057)\n\n* Satellite\
  \ used a large number of inodes when publishing a content. \nThe internal file handling has\
  \ been improved to reduce the number of \nsymlinks and inodes required. (BZ#1244130)\n\n*\
  \ Provisioning on VMWare with multiple NICs was not handling labels \ncorrectly. The interface\
  \ to VMWare has been improved to handle this \nsituation correctly. (BZ#1197156)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ failed synchronization tasks on a Capsule which were \nnot reported correctly, and appeared\
  \ as successful in the web UI. \nThe error handing logic has been improved to display the\
  \ true state \nof the task. (BZ#1215838)\n\n* Satellite synchronized duplicate packages with\
  \ the same epoch, \nname, version, release, and architecture (ENVRA), but which were \nsigned\
  \ by different checksums. This caused issues for clients \nattempting to install from the\
  \ repository. The code was updated to \nrespect the primary metadata, and only download a\
  \ single package. \n(BZ#1132659)\n\nUsers of Red Hat Satellite are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated \npackages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues \nand add this\
  \ enhancement."
