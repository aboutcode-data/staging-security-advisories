summary: "Updated kdepim packages are now available that fix a local buffer overflow\nvulnerability.\n\
  \nThe K Desktop Environment (KDE) is a graphical desktop for the X Window\nSystem. The KDE\
  \ Personal Information Management (kdepim) suite helps you to\norganize your mail, tasks,\
  \ appointments, and contacts. \n\nThe KDE team found a buffer overflow in the file information\
  \ reader of\nVCF files. An attacker could construct a VCF file so that when it was\nopened\
  \ by a victim it would execute arbitrary commands.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0988 to this issue.\n\nUsers of\
  \ kdepim are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported security\
  \ patch that corrects this issue."
