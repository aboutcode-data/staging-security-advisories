summary: |
  A jboss-ec2-eap update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  The jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). With this update, the packages have been updated to ensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.9.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that JGroups did not require necessary headers for encrypt and auth protocols from new nodes joining the cluster. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass security restrictions, and use this vulnerability to send and receive messages within the cluster, leading to information disclosure, message spoofing, or further possible attacks. (CVE-2016-2141)

  More information about this vulnerability is available at: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2360521

  * A directory traversal flaw was found in Tomcat's and JBoss Web's RequestUtil.java. A remote, authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and list a parent directory via a '/..' in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call, as demonstrated by the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps directory. (CVE-2015-5174)

  The CVE-2016-2141 issue was discovered by Dennis Reed (Red Hat).
