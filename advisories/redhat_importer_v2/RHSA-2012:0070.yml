summary: |
  Updated ruby packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
  arrays (hashes) in Ruby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
  inputs to a Ruby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
  a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
  could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
  take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization
  has been added to the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker
  successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2011-4815)

  It was found that Ruby did not reinitialize the PRNG (pseudorandom number
  generator) after forking a child process. This could eventually lead to the
  PRNG returning the same result twice. An attacker keeping track of the
  values returned by one child process could use this flaw to predict the
  values the PRNG would return in other child processes (as long as the
  parent process persisted). (CVE-2011-3009)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4815. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4815.

  All users of ruby are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
