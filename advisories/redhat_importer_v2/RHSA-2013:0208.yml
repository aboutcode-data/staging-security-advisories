summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues and multiple
  bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (code name Nova), a
  cloud computing fabric controller.

  The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2012.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  It was found that the boot-from-volume feature in nova-volume did not
  correctly validate if the user attempting to boot an image was permitted
  to do so. An authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass
  intended restrictions, allowing them to boot images they would otherwise
  not have access to, exposing data stored in other users' images. This
  issue did not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage
  mechanism, which is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2013-0208)

  When OpenStack Nova was configured to provide guest instances with libvirt
  and said guests used LVM-backed ephemeral storage
  ("libvirt_images_type=lvm" in "/etc/nova/nova.conf"), the contents of the
  physical volume were not wiped before the volume was returned to the system
  for use by a different guest instance. This could lead to a new instance
  being able to access files and data from a previous instance. This issue
  did not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage mechanism,
  which is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2012-5625)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Phil Day as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-0208, and Eric Windisch as the original reporter of CVE-2012-5625.

  All users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Nova running services will be restarted automatically.
