aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0542
summary: |
  Updated Apache packages that fix a minor security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3.

  The Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
  freely-available Web server.

  An issue in the handling of regular expressions from configuration files
  was discovered in releases of the Apache HTTP Server version 1.3 prior to
  1.3.29. To exploit this issue an attacker would need to have the ability
  to write to Apache configuration files such as .htaccess or httpd.conf. A
  carefully-crafted configuration file can cause an exploitable buffer
  overflow and would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
  context of the server (in default configurations as the 'apache' user).
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2003-0542 to this issue.

  All users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the
  applicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting
  this issue.
