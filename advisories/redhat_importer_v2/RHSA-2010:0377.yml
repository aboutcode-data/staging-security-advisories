summary: |
  Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 4.3 packages that fix
  three security issues and multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 as JBEAP 4.3.0.CP08.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
  innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
  Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
  simple enterprise solution.

  This release of JBEAP for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 serves as a
  replacement to JBEAP 4.3.0.CP07.

  These updated packages include multiple bug fixes which are detailed in the
  Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from the link
  in the References section.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  The JMX Console configuration only specified an authentication requirement
  for requests that used the GET and POST HTTP "verbs". A remote attacker
  could create an HTTP request that does not specify GET or POST, causing it
  to be executed by the default GET handler without authentication. This
  release contains a JMX Console with an updated configuration that no longer
  specifies the HTTP verbs. This means that the authentication requirement is
  applied to all requests. (CVE-2010-0738)

  For the CVE-2010-0738 issue, if an immediate upgrade is not possible or the
  server deployment has been customized, a manual fix can be applied. Refer
  to the "Security" subsection of the "Issues fixed in this release" section
  (JBPAPP-3952) of the JBEAP Release Notes, linked to in the References, for
  details. Contact Red Hat JBoss Support for advice before making the changes
  noted in the Release Notes.

  Red Hat would like to thank Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon of Minded
  Security for responsibly reporting the CVE-2010-0738 issue.

  Unauthenticated access to the JBoss Application Server Web Console
  (/web-console) is blocked by default. However, it was found that this block
  was incomplete, and only blocked GET and POST HTTP verbs. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information. This release
  contains a Web Console with an updated configuration that now blocks all
  unauthenticated access to it by default. (CVE-2010-1428)

  The RHSA-2008:0826 update fixed an issue (CVE-2008-3273) where
  unauthenticated users were able to access the status servlet; however, a
  bug fix included in the RHSA-2009:0347 update re-introduced the issue. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire details about deployed web
  contexts. (CVE-2010-1429)

  Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBEAP
  "server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, and any other customized
  configuration files.

  All users of JBEAP 4.3 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 are advised to upgrade
  to these updated packages.
