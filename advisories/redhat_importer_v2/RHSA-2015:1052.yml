  - CVE-2015-3201
summary: |
  Updated thermostat1 collection packages that fix one security issue,
  several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available as part of Red
  Hat Software Collections 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Thermostat is a monitoring and instrumentation tool for the OpenJDK HotSpot
  Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with support for monitoring multiple JVM
  instances. Thermostat supports monitoring and gathering performance data
  from JVMs running on the same machine, a remote machine, or across a
  network. The tool consists of three components: an agent, which collects
  data, a client, which allows users to visualize collected data, and a
  storage layer, over which the agent and the client communicate. A pluggable
  agent and GUI framework allow users to collect and visualize performance
  data beyond what is included out of the box.

  The thermostat1 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.2.0,
  which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous
  version. Among others:

  * A new instrumenting profiler plug-in has been added.

  * The setup of secured Thermostat using web storage has been simplified;
  the default setup has been changed to use HTTP-based storage.

  * Various improvements have been introduced, for example, in the Swing
  client GUI and in a number of charts.

  (BZ#1166688)

  The following security issue was fixed in the thermostat1-thermostat
  component:

  It was discovered that the Thermostat web application stored database
  authentication credentials in a world-readable configuration file. A local
  user on a system running the Thermostat web application could use this flaw
  to access and modify monitored JVM data, or perform actions on connected
  JVMs. (CVE-2015-3201)

  This issue was discovered by the Red Hat Thermostat Team.

  Users of thermostat1 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which fix these issues and add these enhancements.
