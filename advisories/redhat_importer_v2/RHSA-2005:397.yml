summary: |
  Updated evolution packages that fix various security issues are now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Evolution is a GNOME-based collection of personal information management
  (PIM) tools.

  A bug was found in the way Evolution displays mail messages. It is possible
  that an attacker could create a specially crafted mail message that when
  opened by a victim causes Evolution to stop responding. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2005-0806 to this issue.

  A bug was also found in Evolution's helper program camel-lock-helper. This
  bug could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges if
  camel-lock-helper has been built to execute with elevated privileges.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2005-0102 to this issue.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
  camel-lock-helper is not built to execute with elevated privileges by
  default.  Please note however that if users have rebuilt Evolution from the
  source RPM, as the root user, camel-lock-helper may be given elevated
  privileges.

  All users of evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  include backported fixes to correct these issues.
