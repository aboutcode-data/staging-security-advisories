  - CVE-2010-3069
summary: |
  Updated samba3x packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information.

  A missing array boundary checking flaw was found in the way Samba parsed
  the binary representation of Windows security identifiers (SIDs). A
  malicious client could send a specially-crafted SMB request to the Samba
  server, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the
  Samba server (smbd). (CVE-2010-3069)

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
