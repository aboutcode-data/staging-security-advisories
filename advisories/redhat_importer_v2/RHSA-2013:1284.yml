summary: |
  Updated ruby193-puppet packages that fix three security issues are now
  available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Puppet allows provisioning, patching, and configuration of clients to be
  managed and automated.

  A flaw was found in the way Puppet handled YAML content during
  Representational State Transfer (REST) API calls. An attacker could
  construct a request containing a crafted YAML payload that would cause the
  Puppet master to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-3567)

  It was found that resource_type requests could be used to cause the Puppet
  master to load and run Ruby files from anywhere on the file system. In
  non-default configurations, a local user on the Puppet master server could
  use this flaw to have arbitrary Ruby code executed with the privileges of
  the Puppet master. (CVE-2013-4761)

  It was found that Puppet Module Tool (that is, running "puppet module"
  commands from the command line) applied incorrect permissions to installed
  modules. If a malicious, local user had write access to the Puppet module
  directory, they could use this flaw to modify the modules and therefore
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Puppet master.
  (CVE-2013-4956)

  Red Hat would like to thank Puppet Labs for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Ben Murphy as the original reporter of CVE-2013-3567.

  These ruby193-puppet packages are used by Foreman, which provides
  facilities for rapidly deploying Red Hat OpenStack 3.0. In this use case,
  Puppet master is used and exposed to these issues. Note that Foreman is
  provided as a Technology Preview. For more information on the scope and
  nature of support for items marked as Technology Preview, refer to
  https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/

  Users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
