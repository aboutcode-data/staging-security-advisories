  - CVE-2013-2219
summary: |
  Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue and three bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  It was discovered that the 389 Directory Server did not honor defined
  attribute access controls when evaluating search filter expressions. A
  remote attacker (with permission to query the Directory Server) could use
  this flaw to determine the values of restricted attributes via a series of
  search queries with filter conditions that used restricted attributes.
  (CVE-2013-2219)

  This issue was discovered by Ludwig Krispenz of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the disk monitoring feature did not function properly. If
  logging functionality was set to critical and logging was disabled, rotated
  logs would be deleted. If the attribute "nsslapd-errorlog-level" was
  explicitly set to any value, even zero, the disk monitoring feature would
  not stop the Directory Server when it was supposed to. This update
  corrects the disk monitoring feature settings, and it no longer
  malfunctions in the described scenarios. (BZ#972930)

  * Previously, setting the "nsslapd-disk-monitoring-threshold" attribute via
  ldapmodify to a large value worked as expected; however, a bug in
  ldapsearch caused such values for the option to be displayed as negative
  values. This update corrects the bug in ldapsearch and correct values are
  now displayed. (BZ#984970)

  * If logging functionality was not set to critical, then the mount point
  for the logs directory was incorrectly skipped during the disk space check.
  (BZ#987850)

  All 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  this update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically.
