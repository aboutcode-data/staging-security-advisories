summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes three security issues and
  various bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  Upgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may
  appear with the status of "Install Failed". If this happens, place the host
  into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an
  "Up" state.

  It was discovered that NSS leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
  padding oracle. (CVE-2013-1620)

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2013-0167 released via RHSA-2013:0907
  was incomplete. A privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to
  make the host the guest is running on unavailable to the management
  server. (CVE-2013-4236)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way NSS decoded certain
  certificates. If an application using NSS decoded a malformed certificate,
  it could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2013-0791)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting
  CVE-2013-0791. Upstream acknowledges Ambroz Bizjak as the original reporter
  of CVE-2013-0791. The CVE-2013-4236 issue was found by David Gibson of Red
  Hat.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2013-4854 (bind issue)

  CVE-2012-6544, CVE-2013-2146, CVE-2013-2206, CVE-2013-2224, CVE-2013-2232,
  and CVE-2013-2237 (kernel issues)

  This update also contains the fixes from the following errata:

  * vdsm: RHSA-2013:1155 and RHBA-2013:1158

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
