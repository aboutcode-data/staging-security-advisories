summary: |
  This is the One-Month notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.3 Extended Update Support (EUS). This notification applies only to
  those customers subscribed to the Extended Update Support (EUS) channel for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Update Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 will be retired as
  of June 30, 2014, and support will no longer be provided. Accordingly, Red
  Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including critical impact
  security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  6.3 EUS after June 30, 2014. In addition, technical support through Red
  Hat's Global Support Services will no longer be provided after this date.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.3 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a
  benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6 release.
