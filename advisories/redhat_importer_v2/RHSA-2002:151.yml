  - CVE-2002-0728
summary: "Updated libpng packages are available that fix a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n\n\
  The libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable\
  \ Network Graphics) image format files. PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the\
  \ GIF format. \n\nVersions of libpng prior to 1.0.14 contain a buffer overflow in the\nprogressive\
  \ reader when the PNG datastream contains more IDAT data than\nindicated by the IHDR chunk.\
  \  Such deliberately malformed datastreams would\ncrash applications that are linked to libpng\
  \ and that use the progressive\nreading feature. Mozilla is such an application.  (CAN-2002-0728)\n\
  \nPackages within Red Hat Linux, such as Mozilla, make use of the shared\nlibpng library.\
  \ Therefore, all users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages which contain libpng\
  \ 1.0.14.  Libpng 1.0.14 is not vulnerable to\nthis issue and contains fixes for other bugs,\
  \ including a number of memory\nleaks and another potential buffer overflow (CAN-2002-0660)"
