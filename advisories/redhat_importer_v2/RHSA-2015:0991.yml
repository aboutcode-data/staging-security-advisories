  - CVE-2014-0227
summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  It was discovered that the ChunkedInputFilter in Tomcat did not fail
  subsequent attempts to read input after malformed chunked encoding was
  detected. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make Tomcat
  process part of the request body as new request, or cause a denial of
  service. (CVE-2014-0227)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Before this update, the tomcat6 init script did not try to kill the
  tomcat process if an attempt to stop it was unsuccessful, which would
  prevent tomcat from restarting properly. The init script was modified to
  correct this issue. (BZ#1207048)

  All Tomcat 6 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
