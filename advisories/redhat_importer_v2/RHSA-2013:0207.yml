summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one security
  issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light
  and rich Java applications.

  The GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing
  both the JBoss Enterprise Web Platform administrator password and the
  sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A local
  user able to access the directory where the GUI installer for JBoss
  Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 was run could use this flaw to gain
  administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise Web Platform instance.
  (CVE-2013-0218)

  Note: This update provides the initial release of the GUI installer for
  version 5.2.0. Users continuing to use the 5.1.2 installer will remain
  vulnerable to this issue.

  This issue was discovered by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security
  Response Team.

  Users requiring the GUI installer for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0
  are advised to apply this update.
