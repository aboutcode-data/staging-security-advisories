summary: |
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 2.2 is now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
  managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
  administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager. Major changes in version 2.2 include an
  import and export capability, and desktop support (VDI).

  It was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not
  correctly pass the postzero parameter for deleted volumes after snapshot
  merging. This resulted in such volumes not being securely deleted as
  expected. A guest user in a new, raw virtual machine (VM), created in a
  data domain that has had VMs deleted from it, could use this flaw to read
  limited data from those deleted VMs, potentially disclosing sensitive
  information. (CVE-2010-2224)

  issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager. These fixes are for expat issues
