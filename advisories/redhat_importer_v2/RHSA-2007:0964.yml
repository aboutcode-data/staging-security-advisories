summary: "Updated OpenSSL packages that correct several security issues are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements Secure Sockets\
  \ Layer (SSL v2/v3) and\nTransport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength\n\
  general purpose cryptography library. Datagram TLS (DTLS) is a protocol\nbased on TLS that\
  \ is capable of securing datagram transport (UDP for\ninstance). \n\nThe OpenSSL security\
  \ team discovered a flaw in DTLS support.  An attacker\ncould create a malicious client or\
  \ server that could trigger a heap\noverflow. This is possibly exploitable to run arbitrary\
  \ code, but it has\nnot been verified  (CVE-2007-4995). Note that this flaw only affects\n\
  applications making use of DTLS. Red Hat does not ship any DTLS client or\nserver applications\
  \ in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nA flaw was found in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() utility\
  \ function. An\nattacker could send a list of ciphers to an application that used this\nfunction\
  \ and overrun a buffer with a single byte (CVE-2007-5135). Few\napplications make use of this\
  \ vulnerable function and generally it is used\nonly when applications are compiled for debugging.\n\
  \nA number of possible side-channel attacks were discovered affecting\nOpenSSL. A local attacker\
  \ could possibly obtain RSA private keys being\nused on a system. In practice these attacks\
  \ would be difficult to perform\noutside of a lab environment. This update contains backported\
  \ patches\ndesigned to mitigate these issues.  (CVE-2007-3108).\n\nUsers of OpenSSL should\
  \ upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues.\
  \  \n\nPlease note that the fix for the DTLS flaw involved an overhaul of the DTLS\nhandshake\
  \ processing which may introduce incompatibilities if a new client\nis used with an older\
  \ server.\n\nAfter installing this update, users are advised to either restart all\nservices\
  \ that use OpenSSL or restart their system."
