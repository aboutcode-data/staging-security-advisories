  - CVE-2012-0864
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C and standard math libraries used
  by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux
  system cannot function correctly.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the implementation of the printf
  functions family. This could allow an attacker to bypass FORTIFY_SOURCE
  protections and execute arbitrary code using a format string flaw in an
  application, even though these protections are expected to limit the impact
  of such flaws to an application abort. (CVE-2012-0864)

  All users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a patch to resolve this issue.
