summary: "Updated abrt packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important\
  \ security \nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives\
  \ \na detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the References \nsection.\n\
  \nABRT (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool) is a tool to help users to detect\ndefects in applications\
  \ and to create a bug report with all the information\nneeded by a maintainer to fix it. It\
  \ uses a plug-in system to extend its\nfunctionality. \n\nIt was found that ABRT was vulnerable\
  \ to multiple race condition and \nsymbolic link flaws. A local attacker could use these flaws\
  \ to potentially \nescalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3315)\n\nIt was discovered\
  \ that the kernel-invoked coredump processor provided by \nABRT wrote core dumps to files\
  \ owned by other system users. This could \nresult in information disclosure if an application\
  \ crashed while its \ncurrent directory was a directory writable to by other users (such as\
  \ \n/tmp). (CVE-2015-3142)\n\nIt was discovered that the default event handling scripts installed\
  \ by ABRT \ndid not handle symbolic links correctly. A local attacker with write access \n\
  to an ABRT problem directory could use this flaw to escalate their \nprivileges. (CVE-2015-1869)\n\
  \nIt was found that the ABRT event scripts created a user-readable copy of an \nsosreport\
  \ file in ABRT problem directories, and included excerpts of \n/var/log/messages selected\
  \ by the user-controlled process name, leading to \nan information disclosure. (CVE-2015-1870)\n\
  \nIt was discovered that, when moving problem reports between certain \ndirectories, abrt-handle-upload\
  \ did not verify that the new problem \ndirectory had appropriate permissions and did not\
  \ contain symbolic links. \nAn attacker able to create a crafted problem report could use\
  \ this flaw to \nexpose other parts of ABRT to attack, or to overwrite arbitrary files on\n\
  the system. (CVE-2015-3147)\n\nMultiple directory traversal flaws were found in the abrt-dbus\
  \ D-Bus \nservice. A local attacker could use these flaws to read and write arbitrary \nfiles\
  \ as the root user. (CVE-2015-3151)\n\nIt was discovered that the abrt-dbus D-Bus service\
  \ did not properly check \nthe validity of the problem directory argument in the ChownProblemDir,\
  \ \nDeleteElement, and DeleteProblem methods. A local attacker could use this \nflaw to take\
  \ ownership of arbitrary files and directories, or to delete\nfiles and directories as the\
  \ root user. (CVE-2015-3150)\n\nIt was discovered that the abrt-action-install-debuginfo-to-abrt-cache\
  \ \nhelper program did not properly filter the process environment before \ninvoking abrt-action-install-debuginfo.\
  \ A local attacker could use this \nflaw to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3159)\n\
  \nAll users of abrt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which \ncorrect these\
  \ issues."
