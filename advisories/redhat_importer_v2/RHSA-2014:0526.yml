summary: |
  Updated tomcat7 packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  It was found that when Tomcat processed a series of HTTP requests in which
  at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or
  one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat
  would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or
  obtain sensitive information from other requests. (CVE-2013-4286)

  It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-3544 did not properly resolve a
  denial of service flaw in the way Tomcat processed chunk extensions and
  trailing headers in chunked requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw
  to send an excessively long request that, when processed by Tomcat, could
  consume network bandwidth, CPU, and memory on the Tomcat server. Note that
  chunked transfer encoding is enabled by default. (CVE-2013-4322)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload,
  which is embedded in Tomcat, handled small-sized buffers used by
  MultipartStream. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create a
  malformed Content-Type header for a multipart request, causing Tomcat to
  enter an infinite loop when processing such an incoming request.
  (CVE-2014-0050)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated tomcat7 packages, which contain backported patches to correct these
  issues. The Red Hat JBoss Web Server process must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
