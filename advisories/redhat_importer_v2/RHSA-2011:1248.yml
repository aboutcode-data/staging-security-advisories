summary: |
  An updated ca-certificates package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact.

  This package contains the set of CA certificates chosen by the Mozilla
  Foundation for use with the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

  It was found that a Certificate Authority (CA) issued fraudulent HTTPS
  certificates. This update removes that CA's root certificate from the
  ca-certificates package, rendering any HTTPS certificates signed by that CA
  as untrusted. (BZ#734381)

  All users should upgrade to this updated package. After installing the
  update, all applications using the ca-certificates package must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
