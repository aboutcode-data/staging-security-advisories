  - CVE-2014-0202
summary: |
  An updated rhevm-dwh package that fixes one security issue and two bugs is
  now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager data warehouse package
  provides the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process and database scripts to
  create a historic database API. It also provides SQL BI reports creation
  for management and monitoring.

  It was found that the ovirt-engine-dwh setup script logged the history
  database password in plain text to a world-readable file. An attacker with
  a local user account on the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
  server could use this flaw to access, read, and modify the reports
  database. (CVE-2014-0202)

  Note: Applying the update provided by this advisory does not modify any
  existing log files. It is recommended that you search your existing log
  files and remove any occurrences of plain text passwords manually.

  This issue was discovered by Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the read-only user and custom users for the data warehouse
  database would lose access to views in the database when the database was
  upgraded. This was caused by the views being regenerated when the database
  was upgraded and the permissions for those views not being applied to the
  newly generated views. Now, user permissions are retained when the database
  is upgraded. (BZ#1078129)

  * Previously, the ovirt-engine-dwh-setup command would fail under certain
  conditions if the pg_hba.conf file had been manually edited prior to
  running that command. This was caused by the setup process checking the
  exact number of spaces in between values on the line corresponding to
  'local'. Now, the logic for checking the values in that line has been
  revised so that the setup process can correctly read all values regardless
  of the number of spaces. (BZ#1084760)

  All rhevm-dwh users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects these issues.
