summary: "An updated mod_nss package that fixes several bugs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 6.\n\nThe mod_nss module provides strong cryptography for the Apache HTTP Server via\
  \ the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, using the Network\
  \ Security Services (NSS) security library.\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs: \n\n\
  * When the NSS library was not initialized and mod_nss tried to clear its SSL cache on start-up,\
  \ mod_nss terminated unexpectedly when the NSS library was built with debugging enabled. With\
  \ this update, mod_nss does not try to clear the SSL cache in the described scenario, thus\
  \ preventing this bug. (BZ#691502)\n\n* Previously, a static array containing the arguments\
  \ for launching the nss_pcache command was overflowing the size by one. This could lead to\
  \ a variety of issues including unexpected termination. This bug has been fixed, and mod_nss\
  \ now uses properly sized static array when launching nss_pcache. (BZ#714154)\n\n* Prior to\
  \ this update, client certificates were only retrieved during the initial SSL handshake if\
  \ the NSSVerifyClient option was set to \"require\" or \"optional\". Also, the FakeBasicAuth\
  \ option only retrieved Common Name rather than the entire certificate subject. Consequently,\
  \ it was possible to spoof an identity using that option. This bug has been fixed, the FakeBasicAuth\
  \ option is now prefixed with \"/\" and is thus compatible with OpenSSL, and certificates\
  \ are now retrieved on all subsequent requests beyond the first one. (BZ#702437)\n\nUsers\
  \ of mod_nss are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these bugs."
