summary: |
  An update for rh-nodejs6-nodejs is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Node.js is a software development platform for building fast and scalable network applications in the JavaScript programming language.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-nodejs6-nodejs (6.11.3). (BZ#1476317)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that Node.js was using a non-randomized seed when populating hash tables. An attacker, able to supply a large number of inputs, could send specially crafted entries to the Node.js application, maximizing hash collisions to trigger an excessive amount of CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-11499)
