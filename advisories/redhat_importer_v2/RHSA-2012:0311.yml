  - CVE-2008-3277
summary: |
  Updated ibutils packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The ibutils packages provide InfiniBand network and path diagnostics.

  It was found that the ibmssh executable had an insecure relative RPATH
  (runtime library search path) set in the ELF (Executable and Linking
  Format) header. A local user able to convince another user to run ibmssh in
  an attacker-controlled directory could run arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the victim. (CVE-2008-3277)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Under certain circumstances, the "ibdiagnet -r" command could suffer from
  memory corruption and terminate with a "double free or corruption" message
  and a backtrace. With this update, the correct memory management function
  is used to prevent the corruption. (BZ#711779)

  All users of ibutils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
