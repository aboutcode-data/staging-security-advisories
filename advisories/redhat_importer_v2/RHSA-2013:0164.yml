  - CVE-2012-3546
summary: |
  Updated jbossweb packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
  and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Web is the web container, based on Apache Tomcat, in JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It provides a single deployment platform for the
  JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies.

  It was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with
  another component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to
  FormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was
  possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator
  by appending "/j_security_check" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker
  with an authenticated session on an affected application could use this
  flaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not
  permitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.
  (CVE-2012-3546)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all applications
  and configuration files).

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. The JBoss server process must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
