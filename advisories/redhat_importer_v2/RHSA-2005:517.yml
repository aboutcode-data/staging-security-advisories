  - CVE-2005-1766
summary: |
  An updated HelixPlayer package that fixes a buffer overflow issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  HelixPlayer is a media player.

  A buffer overflow bug was found in the way HelixPlayer processes SMIL files.
  An attacker could create a specially crafted SMIL file, which when combined
  with a malicious web server, could execute arbitrary code when opened by a
  user. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2005-1766 to this issue.

  All users of HelixPlayer are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains HelixPlayer version 10.0.5 and is not vulnerable to this issue.
