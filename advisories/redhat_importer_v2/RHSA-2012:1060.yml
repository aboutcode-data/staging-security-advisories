  - CVE-2012-2395
summary: |
  An updated cobbler package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Cobbler is a network install server. Cobbler supports PXE, virtualized
  installs, and re-installing existing Linux machines.

  A command injection flaw was found in Cobbler's power management XML-RPC
  method. A remote, authenticated user who is permitted to perform Cobbler
  configuration changes via the Cobbler XML-RPC API, could use this flaw to
  execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the Red Hat Network
  Satellite server. (CVE-2012-2395)

  Note: Red Hat Network Satellite uses a special user account to configure
  Cobbler. By default, only this account is permitted to perform Cobbler
  configuration changes, and the credentials for the account are only
  accessible to the Satellite host's administrator. As such, this issue only
  affected environments where the administrator allowed other users to make
  Cobbler configuration changes.

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4 are advised to upgrade to this
  updated cobbler package, which contains a backported patch to correct this
  issue. Red Hat Network Satellite must be restarted
  ("/usr/sbin/rhn-satellite restart") for this update to take effect.
