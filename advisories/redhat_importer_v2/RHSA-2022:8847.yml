  - CVE-2021-22570
summary: "An update for protobuf is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.2.4 (Train).\
  \ \nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate.\
  \ \nA Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity\
  \ rating, \nis available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\
  \nProtocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient\nyet extensible format.\
  \ Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of\nits internal RPC protocols and file formats.\n\
  \nProtocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for\nserializing structured\
  \ data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and\nsimpler. You define how you want your data to\
  \ be structured once, then\nyou can use special generated source code to easily write and\
  \ read\nyour structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a\nvariety of\
  \ languages. You can even update your data structure without\nbreaking deployed programs that\
  \ are compiled against the old format. This package contains Protocol Buffers compiler for\
  \ all programming\nlanguages and C++ headers and Static libraries for Protocol Buffers built\
  \ with optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Incorrect parsing of nullchar\
  \ in the proto symbol leads to Nullptr dereference (CVE-2021-22570)"
