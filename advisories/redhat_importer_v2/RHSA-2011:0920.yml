  - CVE-2011-1526
summary: |
  Updated krb5-appl packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The krb5-appl packages provide Kerberos-aware telnet, ftp, rcp, rsh, and
  rlogin clients and servers. While these have been replaced by tools such as
  OpenSSH in most environments, they remain in use in others.

  It was found that gssftp, a Kerberos-aware FTP server, did not properly
  drop privileges. A remote FTP user could use this flaw to gain unauthorized
  read or write access to files that are owned by the root group.
  (CVE-2011-1526)

  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Tim Zingelman as the original reporter.

  All krb5-appl users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue.
