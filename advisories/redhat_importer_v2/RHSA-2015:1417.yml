  - CVE-2015-2775
summary: |
  Updated mailman packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Mailman is a program used to help manage e-mail discussion lists.

  It was found that mailman did not sanitize the list name before passing it
  to certain MTAs. A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code as the user running mailman. (CVE-2015-2775)

  It was found that mailman stored private email messages in a world-readable
  directory. A local user could use this flaw to read private mailing list
  archives. (CVE-2002-0389)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, it was impossible to configure Mailman in a way that
  Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) would
  recognize Sender alignment for Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM)
  signatures. Consequently, Mailman list subscribers that belonged to a mail
  server with a "reject" policy for DMARC, such as yahoo.com or AOL.com, were
  unable to receive Mailman forwarded messages from senders residing in any
  domain that provided DKIM signatures. With this update, domains with a
  "reject" DMARC policy are recognized correctly, and Mailman list
  administrators are able to configure the way these messages are handled.
  As a result, after a proper configuration, subscribers now correctly
  receive Mailman forwarded messages in this scenario. (BZ#1095359)

  * Mailman used a console encoding when generating a subject for a "welcome
  email" when new mailing lists were created by the "newlist" command.
  Consequently, when the console encoding did not match the encoding used by
  Mailman for that particular language, characters in the "welcome email"
  could be displayed incorrectly. Mailman has been fixed to use the correct
  encoding, and characters in the "welcome email" are now displayed properly.
  (BZ#1056366)

  * The "rmlist" command used a hardcoded path to list data based on the
  VAR_PREFIX configuration variable. As a consequence, when the list was
  created outside of VAR_PREFIX, it was impossible to remove it using the
  "rmlist" command. With this update, the "rmlist" command uses the correct
  LIST_DATA_DIR value instead of VAR_PREFIX, and it is now possible to remove
  the list in described situation. (BZ#1008139)

  * Due to an incompatibility between Python and Mailman in Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6, when moderators were approving a moderated message to a
  mailing list and checked the "Preserve messages for the site administrator"
  checkbox, Mailman failed to approve the message and returned an error.
  This incompatibility has been fixed, and Mailman now approves messages as
  expected in this scenario. (BZ#765807)

  * When Mailman was set to not archive a list but the archive was not set to
  private, attachments sent to that list were placed in a public archive.
  Consequently, users of Mailman web interface could list private attachments
  because httpd configuration of public archive directory allows listing all
  files in the archive directory. The httpd configuration of Mailman has been
  fixed to not allow listing of private archive directory, and users of
  Mailman web interface are no longer able to list private attachments.
  (BZ#745409)

  Users of mailman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
