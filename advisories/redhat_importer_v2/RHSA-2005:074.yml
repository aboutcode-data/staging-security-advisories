  - CVE-2004-0175
summary: "Updated rsh packages that fix various bugs and a theoretical security issue\nare now\
  \ available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\n\
  Security Response Team\n\nThe rsh package contains a set of programs that allow users to run\n\
  commands on remote machines, login to other machines, and copy files\nbetween machines, using\
  \ the rsh, rlogin, and rcp commands. All three of\nthese commands use rhosts-style authentication.\n\
  \nThe rcp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside\
  \ of the current directory.  This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses\
  \ rcp to copy files from a malicious server. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0175 to this issue.\n\nThese updated packages\
  \ also address the following bugs:\n\nThe rexec command failed with \"Invalid Argument\",\
  \ because the code\nused sigaction() as an unsupported signal.\n\nThe rlogind server reported\
  \ \"SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN but calls wait()\"\nmessage to the system log because the original\
  \ BSD code was ported\nincorrectly to linux.\n\nThe rexecd server did not function on systems\
  \ where client hostnames were\nnot in the DNS service, because server code called gethostbyaddr()\
  \ for each\nnew connection.\n\nThe rcp command incorrectly used the \"errno\" variable and\
  \ produced\nerroneous error messages.\n\nThe rexecd command ignored settings in the /etc/security/limits\
  \ file,\nbecause the PAM session was incorrectly initialized.\n\nThe rexec command prompted\
  \ for username and password regardless of the\n~/.netrc configuration file contents. This\
  \ updated package contains a patch\nthat no longer skips the ~/.netrc file. \n\nAll users\
  \ of rsh should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues."
