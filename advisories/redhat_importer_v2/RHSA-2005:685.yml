  - CVE-2005-1636
summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix a temporary file flaw and a number of bugs
  are now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. MySQL is a
  client/server implementation consisting of a server daemon (mysqld)
  and many different client programs and libraries.

  An insecure temporary file handling bug was found in the mysql_install_db
  script. It is possible for a local user to create specially crafted files
  in /tmp which could allow them to execute arbitrary SQL commands during
  database installation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1636 to this issue.

  These packages update mysql to version 4.1.12, fixing a number of problems.
  Also, support for SSL-encrypted connections to the database server is now
  provided.

  All users of mysql are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
