summary: "Updated zebra packages that close a locally-exploitable and a \nremotely-exploitable\
  \ denial of service vulnerability are now available.\n\nZebra an open source implementation\
  \ of TCP/IP routing software. \n \nJonny Robertson reported that Zebra can be remotely crashed\
  \ if a Zebra\npassword has been enabled and a remote attacker can connect to the Zebra\ntelnet\
  \ management port.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has\
  \ assigned the name CAN-2003-0795 to this issue. \n \nHerbert Xu reported that Zebra can accept\
  \ spoofed messages sent on the\nkernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine.\
  \  This could\nlead to a local denial of service attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\n\
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0858 to\nthis issue. \n \n\
  Users of Zebra should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\na patch preventing\
  \ Zebra from crashing when it receives a telnet option\ndelimiter without any option data,\
  \ and a patch that checks that netlink\nmessages actually came from the kernel."
