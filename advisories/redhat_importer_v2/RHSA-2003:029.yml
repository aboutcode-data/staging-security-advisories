  - CVE-2002-1405
summary: |
  Updated lynx packages are available that fix an error in the way lynx
  parses its command line arguments, which can lead to faked headers being
  sent to a web server.

  [Updated 16 April 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  Lynx is a character-cell Web browser, suitable for running on terminals
  such as VT100.

  Lynx constructs its HTTP queries from the command line (or WWW_HOME
  environment variable) without regard to special characters such as carriage
  returns or linefeeds.  When given a URL containing such special characters,
  extra headers could be inserted into the request.  This could cause scripts
  using lynx to fetch data from the wrong site from servers with virtual hosting.

  Users of Lynx are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
  contain a patch to correct this isssue.
