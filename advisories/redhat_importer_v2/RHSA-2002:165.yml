summary: "Updated PXE packages are now available for Red Hat Linux Advanced Server\nwhich fix\
  \ a vulnerability that can crash the PXE server using certain\nDHCP packets.\n\nThe PXE package\
  \ contains the PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment)\nserver and code needed for Linux to boot\
  \ from a boot disk image on a\nLinux PXE server.  \n\nIt was found that the PXE server could\
  \ be crashed using DHCP packets from\nsome Voice Over IP (VOIP) phones.  This bug could be\
  \ used to cause a denial\nof service (DoS) attack on remote systems by using malicious packets.\n\
  \nUsers of PXE on Red Hat Linux Advanced Server are advised to upgrade to the\nnew release\
  \ which contains a version of PXE that is not vulnerable to this\nissue."
