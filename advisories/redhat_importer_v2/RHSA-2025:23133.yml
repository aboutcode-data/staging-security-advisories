summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.6

  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform provides an enterprise framework for
  building, deploying and managing IT automation at scale. IT Managers can
  provide top-down guidelines on how automation is applied to individual
  teams, while automation developers retain the freedom to write tasks that
  leverage existing knowledge without the overhead. Ansible Automation
  Platform makes it possible for users across an organization to share, vet,
  and manage automation content by means of a simple, powerful, and agentless
  language.
