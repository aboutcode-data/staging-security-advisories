  An update for spice is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a remote display system built for virtual environments which allows the user to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A vulnerability was discovered in spice in the server's protocol handling. An authenticated attacker could send crafted messages to the spice server causing a heap overflow leading to a crash or possible code execution. (CVE-2016-9577)

  * A vulnerability was discovered in spice in the server's protocol handling. An attacker able to connect to the spice server could send crafted messages which would cause the process to crash. (CVE-2016-9578)

  These issues were discovered by Frediano Ziglio (Red Hat).
