  - CVE-2001-0775
summary: |
  These updated packages fix a buffer overflow in the
  faces reader. This is normally not a security problem; however, xloadimage
  is called by the 'plugger' program from inside Netscape to handle some
  image types. Hence, a remote site could cause arbitrary code to be executed as
  the user running Netscape. It is recommended that users of Netscape
  and plugger update to the fixed xloadimage packages.

  Plugger was shipped in Red Hat Powertools 6.2; if you have
  only installed packages from Red Hat Linux 6.2, you are not vulnerable
  to this exploit.

  A buffer overflow existed in the faces reader for xloadimage. By making
  a specially constructed invalid faces file, and then having the server
  serve this file as a .tif file, arbitrary code could be executed on the
  client computer running Netscape.
