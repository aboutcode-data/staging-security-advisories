summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.2 that
  fixes two security issues, several bugs, and adds various enhancements is
  now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in
  which at least one request contained either multiple content-length
  headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding
  header, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.
  (CVE-2013-4286)

  It was found that Java Security Manager permissions configured via a policy
  file were not properly applied, causing all deployed applications to be
  granted the java.security.AllPermission permission. In certain cases, an
  attacker could use this flaw to circumvent expected security measures to
  perform actions which would otherwise be restricted. (CVE-2014-0093)

  The CVE-2014-0093 issue was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss
  EAP Quality Engineering team.

  This release serves as an update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Documentation for
  these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.2.2 Release Notes, linked to in the References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
