summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security
  issues, various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications
  based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  This release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.0.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 6.1.0
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,
  available shortly from https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/

  Security fixes:

  XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
  frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
  insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
  on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
  CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
  recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)

  Note: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when
  WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements. It is best
  practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce security requirements.

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
  in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
  applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
  response. (CVE-2013-0166)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
  padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

  When applications running on JBoss Web used the COOKIE session tracking
  method, the org.apache.catalina.connector.Response.encodeURL() method
  returned the URL with the jsessionid appended as a query string parameter
  when processing the first request of a session. An attacker could possibly
  exploit this flaw by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain a
  user's jsessionid and hijack their session, or by extracting the jsessionid
  from log files. Note that no session tracking method is used by default,
  one must be configured. (CVE-2012-4529)

  If multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class
  name, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application
  to be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications
  using the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker
  could use this flaw to deploy a malicious application that provides
  implementations of custom authorization modules that permit or deny user
  access according to rules supplied by the attacker. (CVE-2012-4572)

  The GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing
  both the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform administrator password and
  the sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A
  local user able to access the directory where the GUI installer was run
  could use this flaw to gain administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform instance. (CVE-2013-0218)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
  Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.
  CVE-2012-4572 was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP
  Quality Engineering team, and CVE-2013-0218 was discovered by Arun
  Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.1.0.
