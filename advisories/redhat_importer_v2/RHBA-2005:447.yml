  - CVE-2004-0806
summary: |
  Updated cdrtools packages that fix a possible exploit are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  Cdrecord is an application for recording audio and data CDs. Cdrecord
  works with many different brands of CD recorders, fully supports
  multi-sessions, and provides human-readable error messages.

  The cdrecord package on Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not require setuid
  root for use by normal users.  The permissions of the writer device are
  changed by pam_console_apply at console login.  Setting the uid of cdrecord
  to root opens a vulnerability to possible exploitation.

  All users of cdrecord that setuid root should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which resolve this issue.
