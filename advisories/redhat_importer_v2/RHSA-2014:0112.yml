  - CVE-2013-6491
summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues and three bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (nova), which
  provides services for provisioning, managing, and using virtual
  machine instances.

  It was discovered that enabling "qpid_protocol = ssl" in the nova.conf file
  did not result in nova using SSL to communicate to Qpid. If Qpid was not
  configured to enforce SSL this could lead to sensitive information being
  sent unencrypted over the communication channel. (CVE-2013-6491)

  A flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute controlled the size of disk
  images. An authenticated remote user could use malicious compressed qcow2
  disk images to consume large amounts of disk space, potentially causing a
  denial of service on the OpenStack Compute nodes. (CVE-2013-4463)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
  CVE-2013-4463. Upstream acknowledges Bernhard M. Wiedemann of SuSE as the
  original reporter of this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When using GroupAntiAffinityFilter, the scheduler was not filtering
  instances in the group, which could cause an instance to not be scheduled
  at all if a group was specified on boot. With this fix, groups are taken
  into account and the instance is scheduled as expected. (BZ#1014948)

  * If an exchange had not been created previously by a consumer, the
  publisher would crash because it could not find the specified exchange.
  This resulted from Qpid's direct publisher using the wrong exchange type
  'Direct'. With this fix, the exchange type in the publisher has been
  changed to 'direct'. (BZ#1042055)

  * Unhandled errors in the Qpid consuming thread could kill it silently and
  isolate the component from the rest of the system. To fix this, the
  consuming thread has been made more resilient to errors by ensuring it does
  not die on an unhandled error. Compute now logs the error and retries the
  consuming thread. (BZ#1050213)

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
