summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed HTML content. HTML
  containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2010-3767, CVE-2010-3772, CVE-2010-3776)

  Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. The above
  issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
