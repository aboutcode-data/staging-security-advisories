  - CVE-2014-0119
summary: |
  Updated tomcat packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  It was found that, in certain circumstances, it was possible for a
  malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Apache Tomcat
  to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library
  descriptors (TLDs), and tag plug-in configuration files. The injected XML
  parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities
  and/or gain access to the XML files processed for other web applications
  deployed on the same Apache Tomcat instance. (CVE-2014-0119)

  All Tomcat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. Tomcat must be restarted
  for this update to take effect.
