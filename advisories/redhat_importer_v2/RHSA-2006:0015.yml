  - CVE-2005-3629
summary: |
  Updated initscripts packages that fix a privilege escalation issue and
  several bugs are now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The initscripts package contains the basic system scripts used to boot your
  Red Hat system, change runlevels, and shut the system down cleanly.
  Initscripts also contains the scripts that activate and deactivate most
  network interfaces.

  A bug was found in the way initscripts handled various environment
  variables when the /sbin/service command is run. It is possible for a local
  user with permissions to execute /sbin/service via sudo to execute
  arbitrary commands as the 'root' user. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2005-3629 to this issue.

  The following issues have also been fixed in this update:

  * extraneous characters were logged on bootup.

  * fsck would be attempted on filesystems marked with _netdev in rc.sysinit
    before they were available.

  Additionally, support for multi-core Itanium processors has been added to
  redhat-support-check.

  All users of initscripts should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
