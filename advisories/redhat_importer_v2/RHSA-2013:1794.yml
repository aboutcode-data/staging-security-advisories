summary: |
  Updated ruby193-rubygem-actionpack packages that fix multiple security
  issues are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the
  view components.

  A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails performed JSON parameter parsing.
  An application using a third party library, which uses the Rack::Request
  interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass the protection
  implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing the application
  to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to CVE-2013-0155.
  (CVE-2013-6417)

  It was discovered that the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails
  could, under certain circumstances, return a fallback HTML string that
  contained user input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  perform a reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by providing a
  specially crafted input to an application using the aforementioned
  component. (CVE-2013-4491)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the header handling component of
  Action View. A remote attacker could send strings in specially crafted
  headers that would be cached indefinitely, which would result in all
  available system memory eventually being consumed. (CVE-2013-6414)

  It was found that the number_to_currency Action View helper did not
  properly escape the unit parameter. An attacker could use this flaw to
  perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
  data submitted by a user in the unit parameter. (CVE-2013-6415)

  All ruby193-rubygem-actionpack users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
