summary: "Updated Sendmail packages are available to fix a vulnerability that\nmay allow remote\
  \ attackers to gain root privileges by sending a\ncarefully crafted message.\n\nThese packages\
  \ also fix a security bug if sendmail is configured to use smrsh.\n\nSendmail is a widely\
  \ used Mail Transport Agent (MTA) which is included\nin all Red Hat Linux distributions.\n\
  \nDuring a code audit of Sendmail by ISS, a critical vulnerability was\nuncovered that affects\
  \ unpatched versions of Sendmail prior to version\n8.12.8.  A remote attacker can send a carefully\
  \ crafted email message\nwhich, when processed by sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be\n\
  executed as root.\n\nWe are advised that a proof-of-concept exploit is known to exist, but\n\
  is not believed to be in the wild.\n\nSince this is a message-based vulnerability, MTAs other\
  \ than Sendmail\nmay pass on the carefully crafted message.  This means that unpatched\nversions\
  \ of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if\nthey do not accept external\
  \ connections directly.\n\nIn addition, the restricted shell (SMRSH) in Sendmail  allows attackers\
  \ to\nbypass the intended restrictions of smrsh by inserting additional commands\nafter \"\
  ||\" sequences or \"/\" characters, which are not properly filtered or\nverified.  A sucessful\
  \ attack would allow an attacker who has a local\naccount on a system which has explicitly\
  \ enabled smrsh to execute arbitrary\nbinaries as themselves by utilizing their .forward file.\
  \ \n\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages.  For Red Hat\nLinux 8.0 we\
  \ have included Sendmail version 8.12.8 which is not vulnerable\nto these issues.  For all\
  \ other distributions we have included a backported\npatch which corrects these vulnerabilities.\n\
  \nRed Hat would like to thank Eric Allman for his assistance with this\nvulnerability."
