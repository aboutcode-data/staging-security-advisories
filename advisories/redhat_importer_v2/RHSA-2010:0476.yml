summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes two security issues, multiple
  bugs, and adds enhancements is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the
  Linux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a
  deficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's
  virtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM
  process on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,
  causing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)

  A flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
  handled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an
  image or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely
  deleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a
  new, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it,
  could use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs,
  potentially disclosing sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2223)

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for dbus issue
  CVE-2009-1189; kernel issues CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0410, CVE-2010-0730,
  CVE-2010-1085, and CVE-2010-1086; openldap issue CVE-2009-3767; and sudo
  issues CVE-2010-0426, CVE-2010-0427, and CVE-2010-1163.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds several enhancements.
  Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available from
  http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/2.2/html/Servers-5.5-2.2_Hypervisor_Security_Update

  As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
  fixes and enhancements from the KVM updates RHSA-2010:0271 and
  RHBA-2010:0419 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug
  fixes and enhancements from the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
  update RHSA-2010:0473, and fence-agents update RHBA-2010:0477.

  fence-agents: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0477.html

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues and adds these
  enhancements.
