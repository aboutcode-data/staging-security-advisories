summary: |
  Updated texlive packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  TeX Live is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
  formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
  Independent (DVI) file as output. The texlive packages provide a number of
  utilities, including dvips.

  TeX Live embeds a copy of t1lib. The t1lib library allows you to rasterize
  bitmaps from PostScript Type 1 fonts. The following issues affect t1lib
  code:

  Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way t1lib processed
  Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. If a specially-crafted font file was opened
  by a TeX Live utility, it could cause the utility to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the utility.
  (CVE-2010-2642, CVE-2011-0433)

  An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause a TeX Live utility to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the utility. (CVE-2011-0764)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file
  could, when opened, cause a TeX Live utility to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the utility.
  (CVE-2011-1553)

  An off-by-one flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file could,
  when opened, cause a TeX Live utility to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the utility.
  (CVE-2011-1554)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause a TeX Live utility to crash.
  (CVE-2011-1552)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting
  CVE-2010-2642. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the
  original reporter of CVE-2010-2642.

  All users of texlive are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
