summary: "Updated PostgreSQL packages are available for Red Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0.\nThese packages\
  \ correct several security and other bugs.  A separate\nadvisory deals with updated PostgreSQL\
  \ packages for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7,\n7.1, and 7.2.\n\nPostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational\
  \ database management system. \nRed Hat Linux 7.3 shipped with PostgreSQL version 7.2.1. \
  \ Red Hat Linux 8.0\nshipped with PostgreSQL version 7.2.2.\n\nPostgreSQL versions 7.2.1 and\
  \ 7.2.2 contain a serious issue with the VACUUM\ncommand when it is run by a non-superuser.\
  \  It is possible for the system\nto prematurely remove old transaction log data (pg_clog\
  \ files), which can\nresult in unrecoverable data loss.\n\nA number of minor security issues\
  \ affect the PostgreSQL 7.2.1 packages\nshipped with Red Hat Linux 7.3 only:\n\n1. Buffer\
  \ overflows in PostgreSQL 7.2 allow attackers to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute\
  \ arbitrary code via long arguments to the lpad\nor rpad functions.   CAN-2002-0972\n \n2.\
  \ Buffer overflow in the cash_words() function allows local users to cause\na denial of service\
  \ and possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed\nargument. CAN-2002-1397\n\n3. Buffer\
  \ overflow in the date parser allows attackers to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly\
  \ execute arbitrary code via a long date string, also\nknown as a vulnerability \"in handling\
  \ long datetime input.\" CAN-2002-1398\n\n4. Heap-based buffer overflow in the repeat() function\
  \ allows attackers to\nexecute arbitrary code by causing repeat() to generate a large string.\n\
  CAN-2002-1400\n\n5. Buffer overflows in the TZ and SET TIME ZONE enivronment variables allow\n\
  local users to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. CAN-2002-1402\n\
  \nAdditionally, buffer overflows in circle_poly, path_encode and path_add\nallow attackers\
  \ to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. Note that these overflows\
  \ have been fixed in our erratum packages and\nin PostgreSQL CVS, but are not fixed in the\
  \ released versions of PostgreSQL\nversion 7.2.3. CAN-2002-1401\n\nThe above vulnerabilities\
  \ are only critical on open or shared systems\nbecause connecting to the database is required\
  \ before the vulnerabilities\ncan be exploited. \n\nThis update also contains fixes for several\
  \ other PostgreSQL bugs,\nincluding handling of pre-1970 date values in newer versions of\
  \ glibc,\npossible server shutdown hangs, spinlock hangs on SMP PPC machines, and\npg_dump\
  \ improperly dumping with the FULL JOIN USING clauses.\n\nAll users of PostgreSQL should upgrade\
  \ to these errata packages containing\nPostgreSQL 7.2.3 with additional patches to correct\
  \ all these issues. Note\nthat running initdb is not necessary when upgrading from 7.2.1 or\
  \ 7.2.2 to\nthe packages contained in this errata."
