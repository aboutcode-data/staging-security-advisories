  - CVE-2016-2074
summary: |
  An update for openvswitch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Open vSwitch provides standard network bridging functions and support for the OpenFlow protocol for remote per-flow control of traffic.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the OVS processing of MPLS labels. A remote attacker able to deliver a frame containing a malicious MPLS label that would be processed by OVS could trigger the flaw and use the resulting memory corruption to cause a denial of service (DoS) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2074)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Open vSwitch project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Kashyap Thimmaraju and Bhargava Shastry as the original reporters.
