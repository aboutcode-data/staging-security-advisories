summary: |
  Updated packages that provide Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.3.0 and fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and add various
  enhancements are now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in
  the mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page
  served by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module
  (MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd
  child process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user. (CVE-2014-0226)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module
  handled request body decompression (configured via the "DEFLATE" input
  filter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be
  decompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system
  memory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain DTLS
  ServerHello requests. A specially crafted DTLS handshake packet could cause
  a DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2014-0221)

  Note: This update provides a fix for the CVE-2014-0221 issue in openssl
  packages for Solaris, HP-UX, and Microsoft Windows.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module
  executed CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.
  A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause
  the httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)

  A flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could
  allow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a
  series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on
  the server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2014-0193)

  It was found that the isCallerInRole() method of the SimpleSecurityManager
  did not correctly check caller roles. A remote, authenticated attacker
  could use this flaw to circumvent the caller check in applications that use
  black list access control based on caller roles. (CVE-2014-3472)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting
  CVE-2014-0221; upstream acknowledges Imre Rad of Search-Lab as the original
  reporter of this issue. Red Hat would also like to thank James Roper of
  Typesafe for reporting CVE-2014-0193, and CA Technologies for reporting
  CVE-2014-3472.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform also includes bug
  fixes and enhancements. Documentation for these changes will be available
  shortly from the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.0 Release Notes,
  linked to in the References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
