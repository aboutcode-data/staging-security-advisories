  - CVE-2002-0638
summary: "A locally exploitable vulnerability is present in the util-linux package\nwhich shipped\
  \ with Red Hat Linux.\n\n[Updated 8 July 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries\
  \ and pSeries systems.\n\nThe util-linux package contains a large variety of low-level system\n\
  utilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function. The chfn\nutility included in\
  \ this package allows users to modify personal\ninformation stored in the system-wide password\
  \ file, /etc/passwd. In order\nto modify this file, this application is installed setuid root.\n\
  \nUnder certain conditions, a carefully crafted attack sequence can be\nperformed to exploit\
  \ a complex file locking and modification race present\nin this utility allowing changes to\
  \ be made to /etc/passwd.  \n\nIn order to successfully exploit the vulnerability and perform\
  \ privilege\nescalation there is a need for minimal administrator interaction. \nAdditionally,\
  \ the password file must be over 4 kilobytes, and the local\nattackers entry must not be in\
  \ the last 4 kilobytes of the password file.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0638 to this issue.\n\nAn interim workaround\
  \ is to remove setuid flags from /usr/bin/chfn and\n/usr/bin/chsh.  All users of Red Hat Linux\
  \ should update the packages\ncontained in this erratum, which are patched to correct this\
  \ vulnerability.\n\nMany thanks to Michal Zalewski of Bindview for alerting us to this issue."
