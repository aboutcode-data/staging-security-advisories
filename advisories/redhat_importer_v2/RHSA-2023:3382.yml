  - CVE-2023-25815
  - CVE-2023-29007
summary: |
  An update for git is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Git is a distributed revision control system with a decentralized architecture. As opposed to centralized version control systems with a client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git repository is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows the user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection.

  Security Fix(es):

  * git: by feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially controlled contents (CVE-2023-25652)

  * git: arbitrary configuration injection when renaming or deleting a section from a configuration file (CVE-2023-29007)

  * git: malicious placement of crafted messages when git was compiled with runtime prefix (CVE-2023-25815)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
