  - CVE-2014-3917
summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are\nnow available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Moderate security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\n\
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\
  \n* An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's\nsystem call auditing\
  \ implementation. On a system with existing audit rules\ndefined, a local, unprivileged user\
  \ could use this flaw to leak kernel\nmemory to user space or, potentially, crash the system.\
  \ (CVE-2014-3917,\nModerate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs: \n\n* A bug in\
  \ the mtip32xx driver could prevent the Micron P420m PCIe SSD\ndevices with unaligned I/O\
  \ access from completing the submitted I/O\nrequests. This resulted in a livelock situation\
  \ and rendered the Micron\nP420m PCIe SSD devices unusable. To fix this problem, mtip32xx\
  \ now checks\nwhether an I/O access is unaligned and if so, it uses the correct\nsemaphore.\
  \ (BZ#1125776)\n\n* A series of patches has been backported to improve the functionality of\n\
  a touch pad on the latest Lenovo laptops in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n(BZ#1122559)\n\n\
  * Due to a bug in the bnx2x driver, a network adapter could be unable to\nrecover from EEH\
  \ error injection. The network adapter had to be taken\noffline and rebooted in order to function\
  \ properly again. With this update,\nthe bnx2x driver has been corrected and network adapters\
  \ now recover from\nEEH errors as expected. (BZ#1107722)\n\n* Previously, if an hrtimer interrupt\
  \ was delayed, all future pending\nhrtimer events that were queued on the same processor were\
  \ also delayed\nuntil the initial hrtimer event was handled. This could cause all hrtimer\n\
  processing to stop for a significant period of time. To prevent this\nproblem, the kernel\
  \ has been modified to handle all expired hrtimer events\nwhen handling the initially delayed\
  \ hrtimer event. (BZ#1113175)\n\n* A previous change to the nouveau driver introduced a bit\
  \ shift error,\nwhich resulted in a wrong display resolution being set with some models\n\
  of NVIDIA controllers. With this update, the erroneous code has been\ncorrected, and the affected\
  \ NVIDIA controllers can now set the correct\ndisplay resolution. (BZ#1114869)\n\n* Due to\
  \ a NULL pointer dereference bug in the be2net driver, the system\ncould experience a kernel\
  \ oops and reboot when disabling a network adapter\nafter a permanent failure. This problem\
  \ has been fixed by introducing a\nflag to keep track of the setup state. The failing adapter\
  \ can now be\ndisabled successfully without a kernel crash. (BZ#1122558)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ the Huge Translation Lookaside Buffer (HugeTLB) allowed\naccess to huge pages access by\
  \ default. However, huge pages may be\nunsupported in some environments, such as a KVM guest\
  \ on a PowerPC\narchitecture, and an attempt to access a huge page in memory would result\n\
  in a kernel oops. This update ensures that HugeTLB denies access to huge\npages if the huge\
  \ pages are not supported on the system. (BZ#1122115)\n\n* If an NVMe device becomes ready\
  \ but fails to create I/O queues, the nvme\ndriver creates a character device handle to manage\
  \ such a device.\nPreviously, a character device could be created before a device reference\n\
  counter was initialized, which resulted in a kernel oops. This problem has\nbeen fixed by\
  \ calling the relevant initialization function earlier in the\ncode. (BZ#1119720)\n\n* On\
  \ some firmware versions of the BladeEngine 3 (BE3) controller,\ninterrupts remain disabled\
  \ after a hardware reset. This was a problem for\nall Emulex-based network adapters using\
  \ such a BE3 controller because\nthese adapters would fail to recover from an EEH error if\
  \ it occurred. To\nresolve this problem, the be2net driver has been modified to enable the\n\
  interrupts in the eeh_resume handler explicitly. (BZ#1121712)\n\nAll kernel users are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these\
  \ issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect."
