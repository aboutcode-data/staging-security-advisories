  - CVE-2015-3988
summary: "Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix multiple security issues\nare now\
  \ available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having Moderate security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each\
  \ vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nOpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)\
  \ provides administrators and users with a\ngraphical interface to access, provision, and\
  \ automate cloud-based\nresources.\n\nTwo security issues were discovered in the Horizon dashboard\
  \ and are\naddressed in this update: \n\n* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in\
  \ the Horizon Orchestration\ndashboard. An attacker able to trick a Horizon user into using\
  \ a malicious\ntemplate during the stack creation could use this flaw to perform an XSS\n\
  attack on that user. (CVE-2015-3219)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project\
  \ for reporting the\nCVE-2015-3219 issue. Upstream acknowledges Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis\n\
  as the original reporter of CVE-2015-3219.\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the Horizon metadata\
  \ dashboard whereby\npotentially untrusted data was displayed from Glance images, Nova flavors,\n\
  or host aggregates without correct clean up. An attacker could use this\nflaw to conduct an\
  \ XSS attack.(CVE-2015-3988)\n\nAdditionally, the following non-security issues are addressed:\n\
  \n* It was impossible to associate a floating IP address to a port for an\ninstance. This\
  \ occurred if the gateway router was not in the same tenant as\nthe instance but was attached\
  \ to a network shared across tenants because\nonly ports within the tenant were used to find\
  \ reachable gateway routers.\n(BZ#1187992)\n\n* If two or more regions were configured in\
  \ Horizon, then the User, Help,\nand Current Project links would no longer work and the region\
  \ selector\nwas in the wrong location in the UI. (BZ#1189887)\n\n* A load balancer monitor\
  \ was erroneously displayed as associated with\nevery tenant in every pool. The load balancer\
  \ monitor was not actually\nassociated with any tenants, but the improper display prevented\
  \ users \nfrom using the Horizon dashboard to create a tenant association.\n(BZ#1196249)\n\
  \n* When logging into the Horizon dashboard, Horizon sends a query to Nova to\nupdate usage\
  \ statistics. One of the calls would erroneously query deleted\nvirtual machines; if there\
  \ were thousands of deleted virtual machines, the\nCPU usage for Nova would spike and the\
  \ Nova process could crash.\n(BZ#1243301)\n\n* The network profile was not supported by Cisco\
  \ N1KV ML2 drivers. This\nprofile has been removed to maintain Horizon compatibility with\
  \ the Cisco\ndriver. (BZ#1246690)\n\n* A neutron attribute extension was renamed from profile_id\
  \ to profile for\nnetworks and ports. This caused create operations for networks and ports\
  \ to\nfail from the dashboard since the dashboard was still using the attribute\nname n1kv:profile_id\
  \ rather than n1kv:profile.(BZ#1248367)\n\n* If a virtual machine instance failed to launch,\
  \ then the stale port\nassignments were left in the configuration rather than being cleaned\
  \ up.\n(BZ#1249228)\n\nAll python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated\n\
  packages, which correct these issues."
