summary: "Updated Hangul Terminal packages fix two security issues.\n\nHangul Terminal is a\
  \ terminal emulator for the X Window System, based on Xterm.\n\nHangul Terminal provides an\
  \ escape sequence for reporting the current\nwindow title, which essentially takes the current\
  \ title and places it\ndirectly on the command line.  An attacker can craft an escape sequence\n\
  that sets the window title of a victim using Hangul Terminal to an\narbitrary command and\
  \ then report it to the command line.   Since it is not\npossible to embed a carriage return\
  \ into the window title the attacker\nwould then have to convince the victim to press Enter\
  \ for it to process the\ntitle as a command, although the attacker could craft other escape\n\
  sequences that might convince the victim to do so.\n\nIt is possible to lock up Hangul Terminal\
  \ before version 2.0.5 by sending\nan invalid DEC UDK escape sequence.  \n\nUsers are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nHangul Terminal version 2.0.5 which\
  \ is not vulnerable to these issues."
