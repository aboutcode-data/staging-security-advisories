  - CVE-2008-2384
summary: |
  An updated mod_auth_mysql package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The mod_auth_mysql package includes an extension module for the Apache HTTP
  Server, which can be used to implement web user authentication against a
  MySQL database.

  A flaw was found in the way mod_auth_mysql escaped certain
  multibyte-encoded strings. If mod_auth_mysql was configured to use a
  multibyte character set that allowed a backslash ("\") as part of the
  character encodings, a remote attacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands
  into a login request. (CVE-2008-2384)

  Note: This flaw only affected non-default installations where
  AuthMySQLCharacterSet is configured to use one of the affected multibyte
  character sets. Installations that did not use the AuthMySQLCharacterSet
  configuration option were not vulnerable to this flaw.

  All mod_auth_mysql users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  the updated package, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
