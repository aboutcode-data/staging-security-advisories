  - CVE-2010-2235
summary: |
  An updated cobbler package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Cobbler is a network install server. Cobbler supports PXE, virtualized
  installs, and re-installing existing Linux machines. Cheetah is a template
  engine used by Cobbler to process kickstart files.

  A code injection flaw was found in the way Cobbler processed templates for
  kickstart files. A remote, authenticated user, that has the Configuration
  Administrator role privilege, could use this flaw to create a
  specially-crafted kickstart template file containing embedded Python code
  that could, when processed by Cheetah, execute arbitrary code with root
  privileges on the Red Hat Network Satellite Server. (CVE-2010-2235)

  Red Hat would like to thank Doug Knight of the University of Alaska for
  reporting this issue.

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.3 are advised to upgrade to
  this updated cobbler package, which contains backported patches to correct
  this issue. Red Hat Network Satellite Server must be restarted
  ("/usr/sbin/rhn-satellite restart") for this update to take effect.
