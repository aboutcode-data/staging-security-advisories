summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 roll up patch 4, which fixes two security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
  automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
  existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
  CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
  execution speed and quality.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss SOA
  Platform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security
  issues are also fixed with this release:

  A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
  validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
  arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
  SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
  XML signature via a specially-crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

  It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
  for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
  on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
  application server. The patch for this flaw disables external entity
  processing by default, and provides a configuration directive to re-enable
  it. (CVE-2013-4152)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  SOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
