  - CVE-2013-7424
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
  Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
  Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  An invalid free flaw was found in glibc's getaddrinfo() function when used
  with the AI_IDN flag. A remote attacker able to make an application call
  this function could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the
  permissions of the user running the application. Note that this flaw only
  affected applications using glibc compiled with libidn support.
  (CVE-2013-7424)

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
