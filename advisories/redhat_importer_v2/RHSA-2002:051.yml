summary: |
  New Squid packages are available which fix various security issues.

  [Updated 16 April 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server. The following summary
  describes the various issues found and their resolutions.

  A problem was found in the code used by Squid to handle compressed DNS
  replies where a malicious DNS server could cause Squid to crash. This bug
  is fixed in the 2.4.STABLE6 release of Squid.  The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0163
  to this issue. Note that Red Hat Linux 7.3 is not vulnerable to this issue.

  Several buffer overflows have been found in the MSNT auth helper
  (msnt_auth) when configured to use denyusers or allowusers access control
  files.

  Several buffer overflows were found in the gopher client of Squid. It
  could be possible for a malicious gopher server to cause Squid to crash.

  A problem was found in the handling of the FTP data channel, possibly
  allowing abuse of the FTP proxy to bypass firewall rules or inject false
  FTP replies.

  Several possible buffer overflows were found in the code parsing FTP
  directories, potentially allowing an untrusted FTP server to crash Squid.

  Thanks go to Olaf Kirch and the Squid team for notifying us of the
  problems, and to the Squid team for providing patches.

  Note that Carp support has been disabled in this errata. If you need Carp
  support, you can reconfigure it with --enable-carp and rebuild the packages.

  All users of Squid are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which
  contain patches to correct each of these issues.
