summary: |
  An update for dhcp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast address. The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC DHCP service required to enable and administer DHCP on a network.

  Security Fix(es):

  * dhcp: stack-based buffer overflow when parsing statements with colon-separated hex digits in config or lease files in dhcpd and dhclient (CVE-2021-25217)
