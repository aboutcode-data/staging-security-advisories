  - CVE-2009-4029
summary: |
  Updated automake, automake14, automake15, automake16, and automake17
  packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files compliant
  with the GNU Coding Standards.

  Automake-generated Makefiles made certain directories world-writable when
  preparing source archives, as was recommended by the GNU Coding Standards.
  If a malicious, local user could access the directory where a victim was
  creating distribution archives, they could use this flaw to modify the
  files being added to those archives. Makefiles generated by these updated
  automake packages no longer make distribution directories world-writable,
  as recommended by the updated GNU Coding Standards. (CVE-2009-4029)

  Note: This issue affected Makefile targets used by developers to prepare
  distribution source archives. Those targets are not used when compiling
  programs from the source code.

  All users of automake, automake14, automake15, automake16, and automake17
  should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve this issue.
