  - CVE-2012-5483
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues, multiple
  bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Essex.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2012.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. (BZ#867029)

  This update also fixes the following security issues:

  It was found that Keystone did not correctly handle users being removed
  from tenants when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) style
  credentials (credentials that are issued in the same format as standard
  Amazon EC2 credentials) were in use. When a user was removed from a tenant,
  they retained the privileges provided by that tenant, allowing them to
  access resources they should no longer have access to. (CVE-2012-5571)

  When access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) was configured,
  a file permissions flaw in Keystone allowed a local attacker to view the
  administrative access and secret values used for authenticating requests to
  Amazon EC2 services. An attacker could use this flaw to access Amazon EC2
  and enable, disable, and modify services and settings. (CVE-2012-5483)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
  CVE-2012-5571. Upstream acknowledges Vijaya Erukala as the original
  reporter of CVE-2012-5571. The CVE-2012-5483 issue was discovered by Kurt
  Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After
  installing the updated packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone)
  will be restarted automatically.
