summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language\
  \ commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nA flaw was found in the way PHP registers\
  \ global variables during a file\nupload request.  A remote attacker could submit a carefully\
  \ crafted\nmultipart/form-data POST request that would overwrite the $GLOBALS array,\naltering\
  \ expected script behavior, and possibly leading to the execution of\narbitrary PHP commands.\
  \  Please note that this vulnerability only affects\ninstallations which have register_globals\
  \ enabled in the PHP configuration\nfile, which is not a default or recommended option.  The\
  \ Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2005-3390 to\nthis issue.\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the PHP parse_str() function. If a PHP script passes\nonly one argument\
  \ to the parse_str() function, and the script can be forced\nto abort execution during operation\
  \ (for example due to the memory_limit\nsetting), the register_globals may be enabled even\
  \ if it is disabled in the\nPHP configuration file.  This vulnerability only affects installations\
  \ that\nhave PHP scripts using the parse_str function in this way.  (CVE-2005-3389)\n\nA Cross-Site\
  \ Scripting flaw was found in the phpinfo() function. If a\nvictim can be tricked into following\
  \ a malicious URL to a site with a page\ndisplaying the phpinfo() output, it may be possible\
  \ to inject javascript\nor HTML content into the displayed page or steal data such as cookies.\
  \ \nThis vulnerability only affects installations which allow users to view the\noutput of\
  \ the phpinfo() function.  As the phpinfo() function outputs a\nlarge amount of information\
  \ about the current state of PHP, it should only\nbe used during debugging or if protected\
  \ by authentication.  (CVE-2005-3388)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way PHP\
  \ processes EXIF image\ndata.  It is possible for an attacker to cause PHP to crash by supplying\n\
  carefully crafted EXIF image data. (CVE-2005-3353)\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that resolve these issues."
