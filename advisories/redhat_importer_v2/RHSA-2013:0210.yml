summary: |
  This is the one-year notification for the end of support services provided
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy, Red
  Hat will discontinue the extended subscription services provided through
  the Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) Add-On for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
  on January 30, 2014. After that date, critical impact security fixes and
  urgent-priority bug fixes will no longer be available for the following
  products:

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 3
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3

  After January 30, 2014, technical support through Red Hat’s Global Support
  Services will no longer be provided for these products.

  This date also marks the end of the Extended Life Phase for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 3 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6, both of which are currently
  supported within their active, production phase life cycle. As a benefit
  of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on the currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 or 6 releases.

  For more information on the Red Hat Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS)
  Add-On, contact your Red Hat sales representative or channel partner.
  Additionally, you can find more information here:
