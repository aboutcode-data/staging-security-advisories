  - CVE-2008-5519
summary: |
  Updated mod_jk packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Application Server v2.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  mod_jk is an Apache Tomcat connector that allows Apache Tomcat and the
  Apache HTTP Server to communicate with each other.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_jk. In certain situations,
  if a faulty client set the "Content-Length" header without providing data,
  or if a user sent repeated requests very quickly, one user may view a
  response intended for another user. (CVE-2008-5519)

  All mod_jk users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. They
  provide mod_jk 1.2.28, which is not vulnerable to this issue.
