summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
  bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Moderate security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
  JBoss Fuse 6.0.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
  the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
  section, for a list of changes.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
  flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

  Security fixes:

  A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
  validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
  arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
  SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
  XML signature via a specially crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

  A flaw was found in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could possibly use this flaw to unilaterally disable bidirectional
  authentication between a client and a server, forcing a downgrade to simple
  (unidirectional) authentication. This flaw only affected users who have
  enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. (CVE-2013-2192)

  It was discovered that the Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property
  for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
  on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
  application server. (CVE-2013-4152)

  It was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project
  allowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying
  Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
  denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

  It was found that the Spring MVC SourceHttpMessageConverter enabled entity
  resolution by default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct XXE
  attacks on web sites, and read files in the context of the user running the
  application server. (CVE-2013-6429)

  The Spring JavaScript escape method insufficiently escaped some characters.
  Applications using this method to escape user-supplied content, which would
  be rendered in HTML5 documents, could be exposed to cross-site scripting
  (XSS) flaws. (CVE-2013-6430)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload
  handled small-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a
  multipart request, causing Apache Commons FileUpload to enter an infinite
  loop when processing such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)

  It was found that fixes for the CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-6429 XXE issues
  in Spring were incomplete. Spring MVC processed user-provided XML and
  neither disabled XML external entities nor provided an option to disable
  them, possibly allowing a remote attacker to conduct XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2014-0054)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Spring Framework when
  using Spring MVC. When the action was not specified in a Spring form, the
  action field would be populated with the requested URI, allowing an
  attacker to inject malicious content into the form. (CVE-2014-1904)

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom
  library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native
  libraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI
  writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Apache Zookeeper stored
  the password of an administrative user in the log files. A local user with
  access to these log files could use the exposed sensitive information to
  gain administrative access to an application using Apache Zookeeper.
  (CVE-2014-0085)

  The CVE-2013-6430 issue was discovered by Jon Passki of Coverity SRL and
  Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team, the CVE-2013-2035
  issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security
  Team, and the CVE-2014-0085 issue was discovered by Graeme Colman of
  Red Hat.
