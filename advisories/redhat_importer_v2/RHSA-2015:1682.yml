summary: "An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update\
  \ as having Important security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\
  \ which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE\
  \ links in the References section.\n\nMozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup\
  \ client.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\n\
  page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,\npotentially, execute\
  \ arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nThunderbird. (CVE-2015-4473, CVE-2015-4491,\
  \ CVE-2015-4487, CVE-2015-4488, \nCVE-2015-4489)\n\nNote: All of the above issues cannot be\
  \ exploited by a specially crafted\nHTML mail message because JavaScript is disabled by default\
  \ for mail\nmessages. However, they could be exploited in other ways in Thunderbird\n(for\
  \ example, by viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed).\n\nRed Hat would like to thank\
  \ the Mozilla project for reporting these\nissues. Upstream acknowledges Gary Kwong, Christian\
  \ Holler, Byron Campen, \nGustavo Grieco, and Ronald Crane as the original reporters of these\
  \ issues.\n\nFor technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security\n\
  advisories for Thunderbird 38.2. You can find a link to the Mozilla\nadvisories in the References\
  \ section of this erratum.\n\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package,\
  \ which\ncontains Thunderbird version 38.2, which corrects these issues.\nAfter installing\
  \ the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes\nto take effect."
