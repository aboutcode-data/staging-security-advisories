summary: |
  Updated cfme packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
  automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual
  environments.

  A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails' actionpack rubygem performed
  JSON parameter parsing. An application using a third party library, which
  uses the Rack::Request interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass
  the protection implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing
  the application to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to
  CVE-2013-0155. (CVE-2013-6417)

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the saved_report_delete action in
  the ReportController. An authenticated Management Engine user could use
  this flaw to perform an SQL injection attack on the Management Engine back
  end database. (CVE-2014-0137)

  It was found that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine did not properly
  check user role permissions for actions associated with catalogs.
  An authenticated Management Engine user could use this flaw to delete
  arbitrary catalogs regardless of the granted permissions. (CVE-2014-0078)

  Multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the date/time
  implementation of PostgreSQL. An authenticated database user could provide
  a specially crafted date/time value that, when processed, could cause
  PostgreSQL to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  permissions of the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0063)

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in various type input functions in PostgreSQL. An authenticated
  database user could possibly use these flaws to crash PostgreSQL or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
  running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0064, CVE-2014-2669)

  Multiple potential buffer overflow flaws were found in PostgreSQL.
  An authenticated database user could possibly use these flaws to crash
  PostgreSQL or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0065)

  It was found that granting an SQL role to a database user in a PostgreSQL
  database without specifying the "ADMIN" option allowed the grantee to
  remove other users from their granted role. An authenticated database user
  could use this flaw to remove a user from an SQL role which they were
  granted access to. (CVE-2014-0060)

  A flaw was found in the validator functions provided by PostgreSQL's
  procedural languages. An authenticated database user could possibly use
  this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-0061)

  A race condition was found in the way PostgreSQL's CREATE INDEX command
  performed multiple independent lookups of a table that had to be indexed.
  An authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate
  their privileges. (CVE-2014-0062)

  It was found that the chkpass extension of PostgreSQL did not check the
  return value of the crypt() function. An authenticated database user could
  possibly use this flaw to crash PostgreSQL via a null pointer dereference.
  (CVE-2014-0066)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting
  CVE-2013-6417; upstream acknowledges Sudhir Rao as the original reporter
  of this issue.

  Red Hat would also like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting
  CVE-2014-0060, CVE-2014-0061, CVE-2014-0062, CVE-2014-0063, CVE-2014-0064,
  CVE-2014-0065, CVE-2014-0066, and CVE-2014-2669; upstream acknowledges Noah
  Misch, Heikki Linnakangas, Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich, Andres Freund,
  Robert Haas, Honza Horak, and Bruce Momjian as the original reporters of
  these issues.

  The CVE-2014-0137 and CVE-2014-0078 issues were discovered by Jan Rusnacko
  of the Red Hat Product Security Team.
