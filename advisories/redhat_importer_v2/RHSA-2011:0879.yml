  - CVE-2009-4139
summary: |
  Updated spacewalk-java packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4.1 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite provides a solution to organizations
  requiring absolute control over and privacy of the maintenance and package
  deployment of their servers. It allows organizations to utilize the
  benefits of the Red Hat Network without having to provide public Internet
  access to their servers or other client systems.

  It was found that RHN Satellite did not protect against Cross-Site Request
  Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If an authenticated RHN Satellite user visited a
  specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized command execution
  with the privileges of that user, for example, creating a new user account,
  granting administrator privileges to user accounts, disabling the account
  of the current user, and so on. (CVE-2009-4139)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christian Johansson of Bitsec AB and Thomas
  Biege of the SUSE Security Team for independently reporting this issue.

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated spacewalk-java packages, which resolve this issue. For this update
  to take effect, Red Hat Network Satellite must be restarted. Refer to the
  Solution section for details.
