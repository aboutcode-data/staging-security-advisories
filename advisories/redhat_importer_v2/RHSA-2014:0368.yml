  - CVE-2014-2237
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
  OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
  The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication including
  user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and
  AWS-style logins.

  It was found that the ec2token API in keystone, which is used to generate
  EC2-style (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) credentials, could generate a
  token not scoped to a particular trust when creating a token from a
  received trust-scoped token. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  retrieve a token that elevated their privileges to all of the trustor's
  roles. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups that have EC2-style
  authentication enabled were affected. (CVE-2013-6391)

  It was found that the the memcache token back end of OpenStack Identity did
  not correctly invalidate a revoked trust token, allowing users with revoked
  tokens to retain access to services they should no longer be able to
  access. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups using the memcache back
  end for tokens were affected. (CVE-2014-2237)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
  reporting CVE-2013-6391. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as
  the original reporter of CVE-2013-6391.

  All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
