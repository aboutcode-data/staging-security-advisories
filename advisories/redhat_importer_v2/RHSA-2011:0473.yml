summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2011-0080)

  An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled
  out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
  malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
  with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0078)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML
  frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
  the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
  to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0077)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML iframe tag. A web
  page with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
  trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0075)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed multiple marquee elements.
  A malformed HTML document could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0074)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the nsTreeSelection element.
  Malformed content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0073)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey appended frame and
  iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
  Malicious HTML content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-0072)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
