  - CVE-2019-9636
summary: "An update for python3 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language, which includes\
  \ modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python\
  \ supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing\
  \ systems. \n\nThis package provides the \"python3\" executable: the reference interpreter\
  \ for the Python language, version 3. The majority of its standard library is provided in\
  \ the python3-libs package, which should be installed automatically along with python3. The\
  \ remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the python3-tkinter and\
  \ python3-test packages.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* python: Information Disclosure due to urlsplit\
  \ improper NFKC normalization (CVE-2019-9636)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s),\
  \ including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer\
  \ to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section."
