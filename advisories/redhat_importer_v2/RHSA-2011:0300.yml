summary: |
  Updated packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red Hat
  Network Satellite Server 5.4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Network Satellite Server (RHN Satellite Server) is a system
  management tool for Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for the
  provisioning, remote management and monitoring of multiple Linux
  deployments with a single, centralized tool.

  A session fixation flaw was found in the way RHN Satellite Server handled
  session cookies. An RHN Satellite Server user able to pre-set the session
  cookie in a victim's browser to a valid value could use this flaw to hijack
  the victim's session after the next log in. (CVE-2011-0717)

  A flaw was found in the way RHN Satellite Server managed user
  authentication. A time delay was not inserted after each failed log in,
  which could allow a remote attacker to conduct a password guessing attack
  efficiently. (CVE-2011-0718)

  Red Hat would like to thank Thomas Biege of the SuSE Security Team for
  reporting these issues.

  Users of RHN Satellite Server 5.4 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. RHN
  Satellite Server must be restarted ("rhn-satellite restart") for this
  update to take effect.
