  - CVE-2011-3201
summary: |
  Updated evolution packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, contact manager and communication
  tool. The components which make up Evolution are tightly integrated with
  one another and act as a seamless personal information-management tool.

  The way Evolution handled mailto URLs allowed any file to be attached to
  the new message. This could lead to information disclosure if the user did
  not notice the attached file before sending the message. With this update,
  mailto URLs cannot be used to attach certain files, such as hidden files or
  files in hidden directories, files in the /etc/ directory, or files
  specified using a path containing "..". (CVE-2011-3201)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matt McCutchen for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Creating a contact list with contact names encoded in UTF-8 caused these
  names to be displayed in the contact list editor in the ASCII encoding
  instead of UTF-8. This bug has been fixed and the contact list editor now
  displays the names in the correct format. (BZ#707526)

  * Due to a bug in the evolution-alarm-notify process, calendar appointment
  alarms did not appear in some types of calendars. The underlying source
  code has been modified and calendar notifications work as expected.
  (BZ#805239)

  * An attempt to print a calendar month view as a PDF file caused Evolution
  to terminate unexpectedly. This update applies a patch to fix this bug and
  Evolution no longer crashes in this situation. (BZ#890642)

  All evolution users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running instances
  of Evolution must be restarted for this update to take effect.
