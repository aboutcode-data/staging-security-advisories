  - CVE-2008-1686
summary: |
  Updated speex packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Speex is a patent-free compression format designed especially for speech.
  The Speex package contains a library for handling Speex files and sample
  encoder and decoder implementations using this library.

  The Speex library was found to not properly validate input values read from
  the Speex files headers. An attacker could create a malicious Speex file
  that would crash an application or, possibly, allow arbitrary code
  execution with the privileges of the application calling the Speex library.
  (CVE-2008-1686)

  All users of speex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
