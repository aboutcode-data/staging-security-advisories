  - CVE-2004-0411
summary: "Updated kdelibs packages that fix telnet URI handler and mailto URI handler\nfile\
  \ vulnerabilities are now available.\n\nThe kdelibs packages include libraries for the K Desktop\
  \ Environment. \n\nKDE Libraries include: kdecore (KDE core library), kdeui (user interface),\n\
  kfm (file manager), khtmlw (HTML widget), kio (Input/Output, networking),\nkspell (spelling\
  \ checker), jscript (javascript), kab (addressbook), kimgio\n(image manipulation).  Konqueror\
  \ is a file manager and Web browser for the\nK Desktop Environment (KDE).\n\niDEFENSE identified\
  \ a vulnerability in the Opera web browser that could\nallow remote attackers to create or\
  \ truncate arbitrary files. The KDE team\nhas found two similar vulnerabilities that also\
  \ exist in KDE. \n\nA flaw in the telnet URI handler may allow options to be passed to the\n\
  telnet program, resulting in creation or replacement of files. An attacker\ncould create a\
  \ carefully crafted link such that when opened by a victim it\ncreates or overwrites a file\
  \ with the victim's permissions. \n\nA flaw in the mailto URI handler may allow options to\
  \ be passed to the\nkmail program.  These options could cause kmail to write to the file system\n\
  or to run on a remote X display.  An attacker could create a carefully\ncrafted link in such\
  \ a way that access may be obtained to run arbitrary\ncode as the victim.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0411 to these issues.\n\
  \nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 is only vulnerable to the mailto URI\nflaw as a previous\
  \ update shipped without a telnet.protocol file.\n\nAll users of KDE are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported patch for these issues."
