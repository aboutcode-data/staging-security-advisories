summary: "Updated Fetchmail packages are available for Red Hat Linux versions 6.2, 7,\n7.1,\
  \ 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 which close a remotely-exploitable vulnerability in\nunpatched versions\
  \ of Fetchmail prior to 6.2.0.\n\nFetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility\
  \ intended for\nuse over on-demand TCP/IP links such as SLIP and PPP connections.  A bug\n\
  has been found in the header parsing code in versions of Fetchmail prior\nto 6.2.0.  \n\n\
  This bug allows a remote attacker to crash Fetchmail and potentially\nexecute arbitrary code\
  \ by sending a carefully crafted email which is \nthen parsed by Fetchmail.\n\nAll users of\
  \ Fetchmail are advised to upgrade to the errata packages\ncontaining a backported fix which\
  \ corrects this issue."
