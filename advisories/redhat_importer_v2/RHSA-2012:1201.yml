summary: |
  Updated tetex packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
  formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
  Independent (DVI) file as output.

  teTeX embeds a copy of t1lib to rasterize bitmaps from PostScript Type 1
  fonts. The following issues affect t1lib code:

  Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way t1lib processed
  Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. If a specially-crafted font file was opened
  by teTeX, it could cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2010-2642,
  CVE-2011-0433)

  An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running teTeX.
  (CVE-2011-0764)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file
  could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1553)

  An off-by-one flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file could,
  when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1554)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
  font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash. (CVE-2011-1552)

  teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)
  file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF
  documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code:

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in Xpdf. If pdflatex was
  used to process a TeX document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it
  could cause pdflatex to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3702)

  An array index error was found in the way Xpdf parsed PostScript Type 1
  fonts embedded in PDF documents. If pdflatex was used to process a TeX
  document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it could cause pdflatex
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3704)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting
  CVE-2010-2642. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the
  original reporter of CVE-2010-2642.

  All users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
