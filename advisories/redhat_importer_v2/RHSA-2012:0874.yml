  - CVE-2012-2102
summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix one security issue and add one enhancement
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
  the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed HANDLER READ NEXT statements
  after deleting a record. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to provide such requests, causing mysqld to crash. This issue only
  caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted
  after the crash. (CVE-2012-2102)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * The InnoDB storage engine is built-in for all architectures. This update
  adds InnoDB Plugin, the InnoDB storage engine as a plug-in for the 32-bit
  x86, AMD64, and Intel 64 architectures. The plug-in offers additional
  features and better performance than when using the built-in InnoDB storage
  engine. Refer to the MySQL documentation, linked to in the References
  section, for information about enabling the plug-in. (BZ#740224)

  All MySQL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which add this
  enhancement and contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After
  installing this update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted
  automatically.
