  - CVE-2011-0001
summary: |
  An updated scsi-target-utils package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The scsi-target-utils package contains the daemon and tools to set up and
  monitor SCSI targets. Currently, iSCSI software and iSER targets are
  supported.

  A double-free flaw was found in scsi-target-utils' tgtd daemon. A remote
  attacker could trigger this flaw by sending carefully-crafted network
  traffic, causing the tgtd daemon to crash. (CVE-2011-0001)

  Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NATO C3 Agency for
  reporting this issue.

  All scsi-target-utils users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue. All running
  scsi-target-utils services must be restarted for the update to take effect.
