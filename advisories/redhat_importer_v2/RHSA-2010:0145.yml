  - CVE-2010-0624
summary: |
  An updated cpio package that fixes two security issues is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way cpio expanded
  archive files. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
  archive, it could cause the cpio executable to crash or execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running cpio. (CVE-2010-0624)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jakob Lell for responsibly reporting the
  CVE-2010-0624 issue.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way cpio expanded large
  archive files. If a user expanded a specially-crafted archive, it could
  cause the cpio executable to crash. This issue only affected 64-bit
  platforms. (CVE-2005-4268)

  Users of cpio are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
