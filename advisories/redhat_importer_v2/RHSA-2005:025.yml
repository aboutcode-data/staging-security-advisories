  - CVE-2005-0022
summary: "Updated exim packages that resolve security issues are now available for Red\nHat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by\
  \ the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nExim is a mail transport agent (MTA) developed at\
  \ the University of\nCambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. \n\nA buffer\
  \ overflow was discovered in the spa_base64_to_bits function in\nExim, as originally obtained\
  \ from Samba code.  If SPA authentication is\nenabled, a remote attacker may be able to exploit\
  \ this vulnerability to\nexecute arbitrary code as the 'exim' user.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0022 to\nthis issue.\
  \  Please note that SPA authentication is not enabled by default\nin Red Hat Enterprise Linux\
  \ 4.\n\nBuffer overflow flaws were discovered in the host_aton and\ndns_build_reverse functions\
  \ in Exim.  A local user can trigger these flaws\nby executing exim with carefully crafted\
  \ command line arguments and may be\nable to gain the privileges of the 'exim' account.  The\
  \ Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0021\
  \ to this issue.\n\nUsers of Exim are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain\n\
  backported patches to correct these issues."
