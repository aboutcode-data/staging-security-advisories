summary: |
  An update for redis is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

  Security Fix(es):

  * redis: Heap corruption in lua_cmsgpack.c (CVE-2018-11218)

  * redis: Integer overflow in lua_struct.c:b_unpack() (CVE-2018-11219)

  * redis: code execution via a crafted command line (CVE-2018-12326)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
