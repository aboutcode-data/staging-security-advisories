summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A flaw was found in the way PHP parsed multipart HTTP POST requests. A
  specially crafted request could cause PHP to use an excessive amount of CPU
  time. (CVE-2015-4024)

  An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in PHP's Exif extension. A
  specially crafted JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the
  exif_read_data() function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running that PHP application.
  (CVE-2015-0232)

  An integer overflow flaw leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found
  in the way PHP's FTP extension parsed file listing FTP server responses. A
  malicious FTP server could use this flaw to cause a PHP application to
  crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-4022)

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the way PHP performed object
  unserialization. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
  function could cause a PHP application to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-0273, CVE-2015-2787, CVE-2015-4147,
  CVE-2015-4148, CVE-2015-4599, CVE-2015-4600, CVE-2015-4601, CVE-2015-4602,
  CVE-2015-4603)

  It was found that certain PHP functions did not properly handle file names
  containing a NULL character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw
  to make a PHP script access unexpected files and bypass intended file
  system access restrictions. (CVE-2015-4026, CVE-2015-3411, CVE-2015-3412,
  CVE-2015-4598)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way the way PHP's Phar extension parsed
  Phar archives. A specially crafted archive could cause PHP to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2015-2301,
  CVE-2015-2783, CVE-2015-3307, CVE-2015-3329, CVE-2015-4021)

  A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the enchant_broker_request_dict()
  function of PHP's enchant extension. An attacker able to make a PHP
  application enchant dictionaries could possibly cause it to crash.
  (CVE-2014-9705)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the GD library used by the PHP gd
  extension. A specially crafted GIF file could cause a PHP application using
  the imagecreatefromgif() function to crash. (CVE-2014-9709)

  A double free flaw was found in zend_ts_hash_graceful_destroy() function in
  the PHP ZTS module. This flaw could possibly cause a PHP application to
  crash. (CVE-2014-9425)

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
