summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues and three bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0461, CVE-2012-0462, CVE-2012-0464)

  Two flaws were found in the way Firefox parsed certain Scalable Vector
  Graphics (SVG) image files. A web page containing a malicious SVG image
  file could cause an information leak, or cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2012-0456, CVE-2012-0457)

  A flaw could allow a malicious site to bypass intended restrictions,
  possibly leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack if a user were
  tricked into dropping a "javascript:" link onto a frame. (CVE-2012-0455)

  It was found that the home page could be set to a "javascript:" link. If a
  user were tricked into setting such a home page by dragging a link to the
  home button, it could cause Firefox to repeatedly crash, eventually
  leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0458)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox parsed certain web content containing
  "cssText". A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0459)

  It was found that by using the DOM fullscreen API, untrusted content could
  bypass the mozRequestFullscreen security protections. A web page containing
  malicious web content could exploit this API flaw to cause user interface
  spoofing. (CVE-2012-0460)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled pages with multiple Content
  Security Policy (CSP) headers. This could lead to a cross-site scripting
  attack if used in conjunction with a website that has a header injection
  flaw. (CVE-2012-0451)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 10.0.3 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * When using the Traditional Chinese locale (zh-TW), a segmentation fault
  sometimes occurred when closing Firefox. (BZ#729632)

  * Inputting any text in the Web Console (Tools -> Web Developer ->
  Web Console) caused Firefox to crash. (BZ#784048)

  * The java-1.6.0-ibm-plugin and java-1.6.0-sun-plugin packages require the
  "/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/" directory on 32-bit systems, and the
  "/usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins/" directory on 64-bit systems. These
  directories are created by the xulrunner package; however, they were
  missing from the xulrunner package provided by the RHEA-2012:0327 update.
  Therefore, upgrading to RHEA-2012:0327 removed those directories, causing
  dependency errors when attempting to install the java-1.6.0-ibm-plugin or
  java-1.6.0-sun-plugin package. With this update, xulrunner once again
  creates the plugins directory. This issue did not affect users of Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6. (BZ#799042)

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 10.0.3 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
