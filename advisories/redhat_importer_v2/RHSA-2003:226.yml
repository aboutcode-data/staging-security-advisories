summary: |
  Updated Samba packages fixing various security vulnerabilities are now
  available for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  Samba is a suite of utilities providing file and printer sharing services
  to SMB/CIFS clients.

  A buffer overflow in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment re-assembly code for the
  SMB daemon (smbd) in unpatched versions of Samba before 2.2.8 allows remote
  attackers to execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0085 to
  this issue.

  The code for writing reg files in Samba before 2.2.8 allows local users to
  overwrite arbitrary files via a race condition involving chown.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0086 to this issue.

  Multiple buffer overflows in Samba before 2.2.8a may allow remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service, as discovered by
  the Samba team during a code audit.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0196 to
  this issue.

  A buffer overflow in the call_trans2open function allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0201 to this issue.

  All users of Samba are advised to update to the packages listed in this
  erratum, which contain backported patches correcting these vulnerabilities.
