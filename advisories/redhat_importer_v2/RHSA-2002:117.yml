  - CVE-2002-0392
summary: "The Apache Web server contains a security vulnerability which can be used\nto launch\
  \ a denial of service attack (DoS), or in some cases, allow remote\ncode execution.  Red Hat\
  \ Secure Web server is based on the Apache Web\nserver and the secureweb package has been\
  \ updated to fix this denial of service\nvulnerability.\n\nVersions of the Apache Web server\
  \ up to and including 1.3.24 contain a bug\nin the routines which deal with requests that\
  \ are processed with \"chunked\"\nencoding. A carefully crafted invalid request can cause\
  \ an Apache child\nprocess to call the memcpy() function in a way that will write past the\
  \ end\nof its buffer, corrupting the stack.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\n\nOur investigations\
  \ show that this bug cannot be used to gain remote access\nto a server running Red Hat Secure\
  \ Web Server, but it does cause the child\nprocess to die. The Apache parent process will\
  \ notice this and start a new\nchild process when necessary -- using slightly more resources\
  \ than normal.  \n\nAll users of Secure Web Server should update to these errata packages\
  \ to\ncorrect this security issue.  \n\nNOTE: Pay special attention to the installation instructions\
  \ in the\n\"Solution\" section below as they differ from standard upgrade instructions."
