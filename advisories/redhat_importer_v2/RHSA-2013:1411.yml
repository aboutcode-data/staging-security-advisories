  - CVE-2013-4332
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server
  Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without
  these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in glibc's memory allocator functions (pvalloc, valloc, and
  memalign). If an application used such a function, it could cause the
  application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-4332)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, the size of the L3 cache in certain CPUs for SMP
  (Symmetric Multiprocessing) servers was not correctly detected. The
  incorrect cache size detection resulted in less than optimal performance
  for routines that used this information, including the memset() function.
  To fix this bug, the cache size detection has been corrected and core
  routines including memset() have their performance restored to expected
  levels. (BZ#1011424)

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
