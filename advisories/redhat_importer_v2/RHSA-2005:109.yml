  - CVE-2005-0089
summary: |
  Updated Python packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.

  An object traversal bug was found in the Python SimpleXMLRPCServer.  This
  bug could allow a remote untrusted user to do unrestricted object traversal
  and allow them to access or change function internals using the im_* and
  func_* attributes.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0089 to this issue.

  Users of Python are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct this issue.
