summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for\nStronghold\
  \ 4.0 for Enterprise Linux. \n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nThe Hardened-PHP Project discovered an overflow\
  \ in the PHP htmlentities()\nand htmlspecialchars() routines.  If a PHP script used the vulnerable\n\
  functions to parse UTF-8 data, a remote attacker sending a carefully\ncrafted request could\
  \ trigger the overflow and potentially execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-5465)\
  \ \n\nA response-splitting issue was discovered in the PHP session handling. If\na remote\
  \ attacker can force a carefully crafted session identifier to be\nused, a cross-site-scripting\
  \ or response-splitting attack could be\npossible. (CVE-2006-3016)\n\nA buffer overflow was\
  \ discovered found in the PHP sscanf() function. If a\nscript used the sscanf() function with\
  \ positional arguments in the format\nstring, a remote attacker sending a carefully crafted\
  \ request could execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-4020)\n\nUsers of\
  \ Stronghold should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to\
  \ correct these issues."
