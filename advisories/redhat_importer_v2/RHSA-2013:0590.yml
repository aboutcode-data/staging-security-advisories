  - CVE-2013-0288
summary: |
  Updated nss-pam-ldapd packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The nss-pam-ldapd packages provide the nss-pam-ldapd daemon (nslcd), which
  uses a directory server to lookup name service information on behalf of a
  lightweight nsswitch module.

  An array index error, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow flaw, was
  found in the way nss-pam-ldapd managed open file descriptors. An attacker
  able to make a process have a large number of open file descriptors and
  perform name lookups could use this flaw to cause the process to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the process. (CVE-2013-0288)

  Red Hat would like to thank Garth Mollett for reporting this issue.

  All users of nss-pam-ldapd are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to fix this issue.
