summary: |
  An oprofile enhancement update that provides support for POWER5+ and uses
  the current event names for POWER4 and POWER5 is now available.

  The oprofile package contains a profiling system for systems running the
  Linux kernel. Profiling runs transparently in the background while profile
  data is collected.

  OProfile did not recognize the ppc64 POWER5+ processor. The events for the
  POWER4 and POWER5 did not match the currently used event names.

  Users of OProfile are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  add these enhancements.
