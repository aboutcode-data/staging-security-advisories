summary: |
  An update for valkey is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Valkey is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.  You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set.  In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Valkey works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.  Valkey also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split and so forth.  Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Valkey behave like a cache.  You can use Valkey from most programming languages also.

  Security Fix(es):

  * redis: Lua library commands may lead to integer overflow and potential RCE (CVE-2025-46817)

  * Redis: Redis: Authenticated users can execute LUA scripts as a different user (CVE-2025-46818)

  * Redis: Redis is vulnerable to DoS via specially crafted LUA scripts (CVE-2025-46819)

  * Redis: Redis Lua Use-After-Free may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2025-49844)
