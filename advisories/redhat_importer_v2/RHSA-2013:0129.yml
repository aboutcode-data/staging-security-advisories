  - CVE-2012-4522
summary: |
  Updated ruby packages that fix two security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  It was found that certain methods did not sanitize file names before
  passing them to lower layer routines in Ruby. If a Ruby application created
  files with names based on untrusted input, it could result in the creation
  of files with different names than expected. (CVE-2012-4522)

  It was found that the RHSA-2011:0909 update did not correctly fix the
  CVE-2011-1005 issue, a flaw in the method for translating an exception
  message into a string in the Exception class. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to bypass safe level 4 restrictions, allowing untrusted (tainted)
  code to modify arbitrary, trusted (untainted) strings, which safe level 4
  restrictions would otherwise prevent. (CVE-2012-4481)

  The CVE-2012-4481 issue was discovered by Vit Ondruch of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, the "rb_syck_mktime" option could, under certain
  circumstances, terminate with a segmentation fault when installing
  libraries with certain gems. This update modifies the underlying code so
  that Ruby gems can be installed as expected. (BZ#834381)

  All users of Ruby are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
