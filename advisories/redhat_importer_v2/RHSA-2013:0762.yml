summary: |
  This is the 1-Year notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG Version 1 and Version 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise MRG Life Cycle policy, the Red
  Hat Enterprise MRG products, which include the MRG-Messaging, MRG-Realtime,
  and MRG-Grid, Version 1 and Version 2 offerings for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5, will be retired on March 31, 2014, and support will no longer be
  provided.

  Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including
  critical impact security patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for
  MRG-Messaging, MRG-Realtime, and MRG-Grid on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
  after that date. In addition, after March 31, 2014, technical support
  through Red Hat's Global Support Services will no longer be provided for
  these products on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Note: This notification applies only to those customers with subscriptions
  for Red Hat Enterprise MRG Version 1 and Version 2 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise MRG
  Version 1 and Version 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG Version 2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. As a benefit of
  the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently
  supported version of that product.
