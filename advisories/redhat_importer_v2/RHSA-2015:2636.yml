summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's file system implementation
  handled rename operations in which the source was inside and the
  destination was outside of a bind mount. A privileged user inside a
  container could use this flaw to escape the bind mount and, potentially,
  escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-2925, Important)

  * It was found that the x86 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is prone to
  a denial of service attack inside a virtualized environment in the form of
  an infinite loop in the microcode due to the way (sequential) delivering of
  benign exceptions such as #AC (alignment check exception) and #DB (debug
  exception) is handled. A privileged user inside a guest could use these
  flaws to create denial of service conditions on the host kernel.
  (CVE-2015-5307, CVE-2015-8104, Important)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPC
  subsystem initialized certain fields in an IPC object structure that were
  later used for permission checking before inserting the object into a
  globally visible list. A local, unprivileged user could potentially use
  this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-7613,
  Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's keys subsystem did not correctly
  garbage collect uninstantiated keyrings. A local attacker could use this
  flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
  the system. (CVE-2015-7872, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Serebrin of Google Inc. for reporting the
  CVE-2015-5307 issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, Human Interface Device (HID) ran a report on an unaligned
  buffer, which could cause a page fault interrupt and an oops when the end
  of the report was read. This update fixes this bug by padding the end of
  the report with extra bytes, so the reading of the report never crosses a
  page boundary. As a result, a page fault and subsequent oops no longer
  occur. (BZ#1268203)

  * The NFS client was previously failing to detect a directory loop for some
  NFS server directory structures. This failure could cause NFS inodes to
  remain referenced after attempting to unmount the file system, leading to a
  kernel crash. Loop checks have been added to VFS, which effectively
  prevents this problem from occurring. (BZ#1272858)

  * Due to a race whereby the nfs_wb_pages_cancel() and
  nfs_commit_release_pages() calls both removed a request from the nfs_inode
  struct type, the kernel panicked with negative nfs_inode.npages count.
  The provided upstream patch performs the required serialization by holding
  the inode i_lock over the check of PagePrivate and locking the request,
  thus preventing the race and kernel panic from occurring. (BZ#1273721)

  * Due to incorrect URB_ISO_ASAP semantics, playing an audio file using a
  USB sound card could previously fail for some hardware configurations.
  This update fixes the bug, and playing audio from a USB sound card now
  works as expected. (BZ#1273916)

  * Inside hugetlb, region data structures were protected by a combination of
  a memory map semaphore and a single hugetlb instance mutex. However, a
  page-fault scalability improvement backported to the kernel on previous
  releases removed the single hugetlb instance mutex and introduced a new
  mutex table, making the locking combination insufficient, leading to
  possible race windows that could cause corruption and undefined behavior.
  This update fixes the problem by introducing a required spinlock to the
  region tracking functions for proper serialization. The problem only
  affects software using huge pages through hugetlb interface. (BZ#1274599)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
