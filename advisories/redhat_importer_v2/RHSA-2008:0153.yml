summary: "Updated cups packages that fixes two security issues and a bug are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS)\
  \ provides a portable printing layer\nfor UNIX(R) operating systems.\n\nA flaw was found in\
  \ the way CUPS handled the addition and removal of remote\nshared printers via IPP.  A remote\
  \ attacker could send malicious UDP IPP\npackets causing the CUPS daemon to attempt to dereference\
  \ already freed\nmemory and crash. (CVE-2008-0597)\n\nA memory management flaw was found in\
  \ the way CUPS handled the addition and\nremoval of remote shared printers via IPP.  When\
  \ shared printer was\nremoved, allocated memory was not properly freed, leading to a memory\
  \ leak\npossibly causing CUPS daemon crash after exhausting available memory.\n(CVE-2008-0596)\n\
  \nThese issues were found during the investigation of CVE-2008-0882, which\ndid not affect\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3. \n\nNote that the default configuration of CUPS on Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux\n3 allow requests of this type only from the local subnet.\n\nIn addition, these updated\
  \ cups packages fix a bug that occurred when using\nthe CUPS polling daemon. Excessive debugging\
  \ log information was saved to\nthe error_log file regardless of the LogLevel setting, which\
  \ filled up disk\nspace rapidly.\n\nAll CUPS users are advised to upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve this issue."
