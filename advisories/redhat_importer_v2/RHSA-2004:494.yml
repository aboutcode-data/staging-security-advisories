aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0455
  - CVE-2004-0827
summary: |
  Updated ImageMagick packages that fix various security vulnerabilities are
  now available.

  ImageMagick(TM) is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
  System.

  A heap overflow flaw was discovered in the ImageMagick image handler.
  An attacker could create a carefully crafted BMP file in such a way that it
  would cause ImageMagick to execute arbitrary code when processing the
  image.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2004-0827 to this issue.

  A temporary file handling bug has been found in ImageMagick's libmagick
  library.  A local user could overwrite or create files as a different user
  if a program was linked with the vulnerable library.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0455 to this issue.

  Users of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.
