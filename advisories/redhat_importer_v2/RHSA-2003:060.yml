summary: "Updated NetPBM packages are available that fix a number of vulnerabilities\nin the\
  \ netpbm libraries.\n\nThe netpbm package contains a library of functions that support\nprograms\
  \ for handling various graphics file formats, including .pbm\n(portable bitmaps), .pgm (portable\
  \ graymaps), .pnm (portable anymaps),\n.ppm (portable pixmaps), and others.\n\nDuring an audit\
  \ of the NetPBM library, Al Viro, Alan Cox, and Sebastian\nKrahmer found a number of bugs\
  \ that are potentially exploitable.  These\nbugs could be exploited by creating a carefully\
  \ crafted image in such a way\nthat it executes arbitrary code when it is processed by either\
  \ an\napplication from the netpbm-progs package or an application that uses the\nvulnerable\
  \ netpbm library.\n\nOne way that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities would be\
  \ to \nsubmit a carefully crafted image to be printed, as the LPRng print spooler\nused by\
  \ default in Red Hat Linux releases uses netpbm utilities to parse\nvarious types of image\
  \ files.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain patches\n\
  that correct these vulnerabilities."
