  - CVE-2021-29923
summary: "Updated images are now available for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for\nKubernetes\
  \ (RHACS). The updated image includes a bug fixes, security patches and new feature enhancements.\n\
  \nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact\nof Moderate.\
  \ A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives a detailed severity\
  \ rating, is available for each vulnerability from\nthe CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\
  \nNew features\n1. Vulnerability triage workflows - RHACS 3.68 includes the ability to triage\
  \ vulnerabilities in a variety of ways to support your vulnerability management process. See\
  \ Managing vulnerabilities for more information.\n2. Report scheduling for vulnerabilities\
  \ - RHACS 3.68 includes the ability to schedule reports for vulnerabilities helping you to\
  \ send scheduled communications to key stakeholders to assist in the vulnerability management\
  \ process. See Reporting vulnerabilities to teams for more information.\n3. Use AWS ECR AssumeRoles\
  \ - AWS AssumeRoles allows you to define roles with specific permissions and then granting\
  \ users access to those roles. {product-title} 3.68 includes the ability to use AWS ECR AssumeRoles\
  \ to configure roles and grant various levels of access to users. For more details, see Using\
  \ assumerole with Amazon ECR.\n\nImportant bug fixes\n\n1. Previously, searching for CVE’s\
  \ with a specific severity did not returned any results. This issue has been fixed.\n2. Previously,\
  \ when configuring the Manage Watches feature, if you added more than 12 images to the watch\
  \ list, the image list would not display properly. This issue has been fixed.\n3. Previously,\
  \ when the RHACS Operator accessed the central-htpasswd secret, it would create a false positive\
  \ policy violation for the OpenShift: Advanced Cluster Security Central Admin Secret Accessed\
  \ default policy. This issue has been fixed.\n\nSecurity update\n\n1. In earlier versions\
  \ of RHACS, the write permission for the APIToken resource allowed users to create API tokens\
  \ for any role, including the admin role. This issue has been fixed.\n2. The scanner image\
  \ has been updated to patch CVE-2021-29923.\n* golang: net: incorrect parsing of extraneous\
  \ zero characters at the\nbeginning of an IP address octet (CVE-2021-29923)\n\nImportant system\
  \ changes\n\n1. RHACS 3.68 includes updates for the Log4Shell vulnerability detection policy.\
  \ With this update this policy also detects CVE-2021-45046 and it includes the updated remediation\
  \ based on the latest guidance by the Apache Logging security team.\n2. When you upgrade to\
  \ RHACS 3.68, roles that include write access on the Images resource will have write permissions\
  \ for both VulnerabilityManagementRequests and VulnerabilityManagementApprovals resource.\
  \ Red Hat recommends updating the roles to only include the least amount of resources required\
  \ for each role.\n3. If you have installed RHACS using Helm, this update disabled the cluster\
  \ configuration options in the {product-title-short} portal. You can continue to use Helm\
  \ configuration files.\n4. RHACS 3.68 sends notifications for every runtime policy violation\
  \ rather than sending notifications only the first encountered violation. This is the default\
  \ behavior. \n5. Tags of the scanner, scanner-db, and collector images, including the collector-slim\
  \ variant, are now identical to the main image tag. \n6. Red Has changed the image names for\
  \ collector-slim. -slim is no longer part of the image tag. \n7. The roxctl CLI includes a\
  \ new --image-defaults option for the roxctl helm output and roxctl central generate commands.\
  \ It allows selecting the default registry from which container images are taken for deploying\
  \ central and scanner.\n8. Red Hat has deprecated the --rhacs option for the roxctl helm output\
  \ command. Use --rhacs-image-defaults option instead.\n9. By default, the roxctl helm output\
  \ command now uses the images from registry.redhat.io rather than stackrox.io."
