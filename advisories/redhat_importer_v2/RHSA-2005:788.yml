summary: |
  An updated HelixPlayer package that fixes a string format issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  HelixPlayer is a media player.

  A format string bug was discovered in the way HelixPlayer processes RealPix
  (.rp) files. It is possible for a malformed RealPix file to execute
  arbitrary code as the user running HelixPlayer. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2710
  to this issue.

  All users of HelixPlayer are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains HelixPlayer version 10.0.6 and is not vulnerable to this issue.
