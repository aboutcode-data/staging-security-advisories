summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes two security issues is
  now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
  specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
  communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
  and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

  Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
  using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
  version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
  OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
  https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433

  A flaw was found in the way the handle_rx() function handled large network
  packets when mergeable buffers were disabled. A privileged guest user could
  use this flaw to crash the host or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host,
  which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with
  the privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-0077)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting
  CVE-2014-0224. Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-0224. The CVE-2014-0077 issue was discovered
  by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2014-0015 and CVE-2014-0138 (curl issues)

  CVE-2014-2523 and CVE-2013-6383 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2014-0179 (libvirt issue)

  CVE-2010-5298, CVE-2014-0198, CVE-2014-0221, CVE-2014-0195, and
  CVE-2014-3470 (openssl issues)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
