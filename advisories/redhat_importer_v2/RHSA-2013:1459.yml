summary: |
  An updated gnupg2 package that fixes three security issues is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a tool for encrypting data and
  creating digital signatures, compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet
  standard and the S/MIME standard.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way GnuPG parsed certain
  compressed OpenPGP packets. An attacker could use this flaw to send
  specially crafted input data to GnuPG, making GnuPG enter an infinite loop
  when parsing data. (CVE-2013-4402)

  It was found that importing a corrupted public key into a GnuPG keyring
  database corrupted that keyring. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a
  local user into importing a specially crafted public key into their keyring
  database, causing the keyring to be corrupted and preventing its further
  use. (CVE-2012-6085)

  It was found that GnuPG did not properly interpret the key flags in a PGP
  key packet. GPG could accept a key for uses not indicated by its holder.
  (CVE-2013-4351)

  Red Hat would like to thank Werner Koch for reporting the CVE-2013-4402
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Taylor R Campbell as the original reporter.

  All gnupg2 users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
