summary: "Updated Fetchmail packages that close a number of vulnerabilities are\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.\n\nFetchmail is a remote mail retrieval\
  \ and forwarding utility intended for\nuse over on-demand TCP/IP links such as SLIP and PPP\
  \ connections.  Three\nbugs have been found in the header parsing code in Fetchmail versions\
  \ \nprior to 6.2.0:\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow in Fetchmail 6.1.3 and earlier does not\n\
  account for the \"@\" character when determining buffer lengths for local\naddresses, which\
  \ allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a\nheader with a large number of local\
  \ addresses.\n\nBuffer overflows in Fetchmail 6.0.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to\n\
  cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via long\nheaders that are not\
  \ properly processed by the readheaders function, or \nvia long Received: headers, which are\
  \ not properly parsed by the\nparse_received function.\n\nThe getmxrecord function in Fetchmail\
  \ 6.0.0 and earlier does not properly\ncheck the boundary of a particular malformed DNS packet\
  \ from a malicious\nDNS server, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n\
  (crash) when Fetchmail attempts to read data beyond the expected boundary.\n\nAll users of\
  \ Fetchmail are advised to upgrade to the errata packages\ncontaining a backported fix, which\
  \ is not vulnerable to these issues."
