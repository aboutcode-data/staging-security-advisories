  - CVE-2013-4073
summary: |
  Updated ruby packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language.
  It has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  A flaw was found in Ruby's SSL client's hostname identity check when
  handling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL bytes. An attacker
  could potentially exploit this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to
  spoof SSL servers. Note that to exploit this issue, an attacker would need
  to obtain a carefully-crafted certificate signed by an authority that the
  client trusts. (CVE-2013-4073)

  All users of Ruby are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve this issue.
