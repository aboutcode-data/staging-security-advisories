  - CVE-2013-1912
summary: |
  An updated haproxy package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  HAProxy provides high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP
  and HTTP-based applications.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way HAProxy handled pipelined HTTP
  requests. A remote attacker could send pipelined HTTP requests that would
  cause HAProxy to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running HAProxy. This issue only affected systems
  using all of the following combined configuration options: HTTP keep alive
  enabled, HTTP keywords in TCP inspection rules, and request appending
  rules. (CVE-2013-1912)

  In Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise, the HAProxy cartridge is added to your
  application when you select to have your application scaled. Due to the
  way this cartridge is currently used in Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise, the
  CVE-2013-1912 issue is not exploitable.

  Red Hat would like to thank Willy Tarreau of HAProxy upstream for reporting
  this issue. Upstream acknowledges Yves Lafon from the W3C as the original
  reporter.

  Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.3 are advised to upgrade to this
  updated package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
