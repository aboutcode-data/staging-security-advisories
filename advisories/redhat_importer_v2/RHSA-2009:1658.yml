summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
  is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Extras and 4 Extras.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
  Player web browser plug-in.

  Multiple security flaws were found in the way Flash Player displayed
  certain SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
  specially-crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing
  the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2009-3794, CVE-2009-3796,
  CVE-2009-3798, CVE-2009-3799, CVE-2009-3800)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
  upgrades Flash Player to version 9.0.260.0.
