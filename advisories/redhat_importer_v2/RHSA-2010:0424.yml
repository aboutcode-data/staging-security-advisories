  - CVE-2010-1188
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and add one enhancement
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * a use-after-free flaw was found in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function
  in the Linux kernel TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using
  IPv6 had the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote
  attacker could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic
  (denial of service). (CVE-2010-1188, Important)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * kernel support for the iptables connlimit module. This module can be used
  to help mitigate some types of denial of service attacks. Note: This update
  alone does not address connlimit support. A future iptables package update
  will allow connlimit to work correctly. (BZ#563222)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct this issue and add this enhancement. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
