  - CVE-2003-0961
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages are now available that fix a security
  vulnerability allowing local users to gain root privileges.

  The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

  A flaw in bounds checking in the do_brk() function in the Linux kernel
  versions 2.4.22 and previous can allow a local attacker to gain root
  privileges.  This issue is known to be exploitable; an exploit has been
  seen in the wild that takes advantage of this vulnerability.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0961 to this issue.

  All users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  errata packages, which contain a backported security patch that corrects
  this vulnerability.

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 should upgrade to the kernel packages
  provided by RHBA-2003:308 (released on 30 October 2003), which already
  contained a patch correcting this issue.
