  - CVE-2011-4314
summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2, which fixes one security issue,
  various bugs, and adds several enhancements is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light
  and rich Java applications. OpenID4Java allows you to implement OpenID
  authentication in your Java applications. OpenID4Java is a Technology
  Preview.

  This JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 release serves as a replacement
  for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.1.

  This update includes bug fixes and enhancements. JBoss Enterprise Web
  Platform is a subset of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. Users are
  directed to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 Release Notes
  for information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes
  will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was
  not checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to
  receive information that an application only trusts the identity provider
  to assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
  man-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information
  via a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid
  example application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up the
  "jboss-as-web/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory and any other customized
  configuration files of your JBoss Enterprise Web Platform.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.1 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Web Platform
  5.1.2.
