  - CVE-2010-2251
summary: |
  An updated lftp package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program for the FTP and HTTP
  protocols. Like Bash, it has job control and uses the Readline library for
  input. It has bookmarks, built-in mirroring, and can transfer several files
  in parallel. It is designed with reliability in mind.

  It was discovered that lftp trusted the file name provided in the
  Content-Disposition HTTP header. A malicious HTTP server could use this
  flaw to write or overwrite files in the current working directory of a
  victim running lftp, by sending a different file from what the victim
  requested. (CVE-2010-2251)

  To correct this flaw, the following changes were made to lftp: the
  "xfer:clobber" option now defaults to "no", causing lftp to not overwrite
  existing files, and a new option, "xfer:auto-rename", which defaults to
  "no", has been introduced to control whether lftp should use
  server-suggested file names. Refer to the "Settings" section of the lftp(1)
  manual page for additional details on changing lftp settings.

  All lftp users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
