  - CVE-2014-0223
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix two security issues and three bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  Two integer overflow flaws were found in the QEMU block driver for QCOW
  version 1 disk images. A user able to alter the QEMU disk image files
  loaded by a guest could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process
  memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
  execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
  (CVE-2014-0222, CVE-2014-0223)

  Red Hat would like to thank NSA for reporting these issues.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * In certain scenarios, when performing live incremental migration, the
  disk size could be expanded considerably due to the transfer of unallocated
  sectors past the end of the base image. With this update, the
  bdrv_is_allocated() function has been fixed to no longer return "True" for
  unallocated sectors, and the disk size no longer changes after performing
  live incremental migration. (BZ#1109715)

  * This update enables ioeventfd in virtio-scsi-pci. This allows QEMU to
  process I/O requests outside of the vCPU thread, reducing the latency of
  submitting requests and improving single task throughput. (BZ#1123271)

  * Prior to this update, vendor-specific SCSI commands issued from a KVM
  guest did not reach the target device due to QEMU considering such commands
  as invalid. This update fixes this bug by properly propagating
  vendor-specific SCSI commands to the target device. (BZ#1125131)

  All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
