  - CVE-2016-1950
summary: |
  Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way NSS parsed certain
  ASN.1 structures. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially
  crafted certificate which, when parsed by NSS, could cause it to crash, or
  execute arbitrary code, using the permissions of the user running an
  application compiled against the NSS library. (CVE-2016-1950)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Francis Gabriel as the original reporter.

  All nss users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all applications linked to the nss library must be restarted, or
  the system rebooted.
