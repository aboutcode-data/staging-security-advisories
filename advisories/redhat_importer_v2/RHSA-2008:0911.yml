summary: "Updated condor packages that address multiple security issues, fix several\nbugs,\
  \ and introduce feature enhancements are now available for Red Hat\nEnterprise MRG 1.0 for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nCondor is a specialized workload management system\
  \ for compute-intensive\njobs. It provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority\n\
  scheme, and resource monitoring and management.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Condor processed\
  \ user submitted jobs. It was\npossible for a user to submit a job in a way that could cause\
  \ that job to\nrun as a different user with access to the pool. (CVE-2008-3826)\n\nA stack\
  \ based buffer overflow flaw was found in Condor's condor_schedd\ndaemon. A user who had permissions\
  \ to submit a job could do so in a manner\nthat could cause condor_schedd to crash or, potentially,\
  \ execute arbitrary\ncode with the permissions of condor_schedd. (CVE-2008-3828)\n\nA denial-of-service\
  \ flaw was found in Condor's condor_schedd daemon. A user\nwho had permissions to submit a\
  \ job could do so in a manner that would\ncause condor_schedd to crash. (CVE-2008-3829)\n\n\
  A flaw was found in the way Condor processes allowed and denied netmasks\nfor access control.\
  \ If a configuration file contained an overlapping\nnetmask in the allow or deny rules, it\
  \ could cause that rule to be ignored,\nallowing unintended access. (CVE-2008-3830)\n\nThis\
  \ update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the \"amazon_gahp -m\" command sets the AMAZON_GAHP_WORKER_MAX_NUM\n\
  configuration option, fixing the maximum number of processes contacting EC2\nat any given\
  \ time. Previously, Condor did not honor this option, leaving\nthe maximum number of created\
  \ threads unbounded. This has been corrected:\nvalues set with the \"-m\" argument are now\
  \ properly understood.\n\n* the gridmanager constructed KeyPairs for all outstanding EC2 jobs\
  \ before\nany jobs are started. When there were many (>10,000) EC2 jobs in the queue,\nsignificant\
  \ delays occurred. With this update, KeyPairs are no longer \nconstructed up-front.\n\n* an\
  \ error in condor_negotiator caused intialization code to re-run\nwhenever condor_reconfig\
  \ was run. The flag which noted if the\ninitialization code should run was always set to \"\
  true\". This error has\nbeen corrected: the initialization code now executes only at startup.\n\
  \nAs well, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* this release introduces Concurrency\
  \ Limits. These allow Condor to account\nfor resources not directly under its control, such\
  \ as software licenses.\n\n* this update includes the latest stable upstream release of Condor:\n\
  version 7.0.5. Information on the features and fixes included with this\nrelease are in the\
  \ Condor Release Notes, available via the link in the\nReferences section below.\n\n* base\
  \ support for low-latency scheduling and transparent translation of\nEC2 jobs has also been\
  \ added in this update. Note: implementation of these\ntwo features depends on separate packages\
  \ which are yet to be released.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.0 users are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these\nupdated packages which address these vulnerabilities, fix these bugs and\nadd\
  \ these enhancements."
