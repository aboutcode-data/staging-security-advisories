aliases:
  - CVE-2009-3560
  - CVE-2009-3720
summary: |
  Updated expat packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Expat is a C library written by James Clark for parsing XML documents.

  Two buffer over-read flaws were found in the way Expat handled malformed
  UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A specially-crafted XML file
  could cause applications using Expat to crash while parsing the file.
  (CVE-2009-3560, CVE-2009-3720)

  All expat users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, applications using the Expat library must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
