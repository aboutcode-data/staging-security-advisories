  - CVE-2015-5279
summary: |
  Updated xen packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
  managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's NE2000 NIC
  emulation implementation handled certain packets received over the network.
  A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU
  instance (denial of service) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the
  host. (CVE-2015-5279)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. for reporting
  this issue.

  All xen users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, all running fully-virtualized guests must be restarted
  for this update to take effect.
