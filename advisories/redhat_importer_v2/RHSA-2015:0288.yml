  - CVE-2014-3691
summary: |
  Updated foreman-proxy packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The foreman-proxy package provides a RESTful API to manage DNS, DHCP, TFTP,
  and Puppet settings, and can be used as part of Foreman.

  It was discovered that foreman-proxy, when running in SSL-secured mode, did
  not correctly verify SSL client certificates. This could permit any client
  with access to the API to make requests and perform actions otherwise
  restricted. (CVE-2014-3691)

  All foreman-proxy users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which corrects this issue.
