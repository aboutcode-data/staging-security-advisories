  - CVE-2015-7547
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2, 6.4, and 6.5 Advanced Update Support, and Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 and 7.1 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name
  Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
  Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the libresolv library
  performed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could create a
  specially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or,
  potentially, execute code with the permissions of the user running the
  library. Note: this issue is only exposed when libresolv is called from the
  nss_dns NSS service module. (CVE-2015-7547)

  This issue was discovered by the Google Security Team and Red Hat.

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
