  - CVE-2015-1851
summary: |
  Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix one security issue and multiple
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
  and 6.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the
  presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend
  physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and
  NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports
  volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations.
  Programatic management is available via Block Storage’s API.

  A flaw was found in the cinder upload-to-image functionality. When
  processing a malicious qcow2 header cinder could be tricked into reading
  an arbitrary file from the cinder host. (CVE-2015-1851)

  All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the cinder running services will be restarted automatically.
