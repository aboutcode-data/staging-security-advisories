summary: |
  An updated swiftonfile package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
  and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that
  provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data
  storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves
  availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.

  Red Hat Gluster Storage's Unified File and Object Storage is built on
  OpenStack's Object Storage (swift).

  A flaw was found in the way swiftonfile (gluster-swift) serialized and
  stored metadata on disk by using Python's pickle module. A remote,
  authenticated user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the
  storage node. (CVE-2015-5242)
