summary: |
  Updated shim packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Shim is the initial UEFI bootloader that handles chaining to a trusted full
  bootloader under secure boot environments.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found the way shim parsed certain
  IPv6 addresses. If IPv6 network booting was enabled, a malicious server
  could supply a crafted IPv6 address that would cause shim to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3676)

  An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the way shim processed
  certain Machine Owner Keys (MOKs). A local attacker could potentially use
  this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system. (CVE-2014-3677)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way shim parsed certain
  IPv6 packets. A specially crafted DHCPv6 packet could possibly cause shim
  to crash, preventing the system from booting if IPv6 booting was enabled.
  (CVE-2014-3675)

  Red Hat would like to thank the SUSE Security Team for reporting these
  issues.

  All shim users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
