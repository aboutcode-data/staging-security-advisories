aliases:
  - CVE-2002-0082
summary: |
  Updated mod_ssl packages for Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, and
  7.2 are available which close a buffer overflow in mod_ssl.

  When session caching is enabled, mod_ssl will serialize SSL session
  variables to store them for later use.  Unpatched versions of mod_ssl prior
  to version 2.8.7 which use the 'shm' or 'dbm' session caches would store
  session variables using a buffer with a fixed size, making it vulnerable to
  overflow.

  To exploit the overflow, the server must be configured to require client
  certificates, and an attacker must obtain a carefully crafted client
  certificate that has been signed by a Certificate Authority which is
  trusted by the server. If these conditions are met, it would be possible
  for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

  Red Hat Linux 6.2 and earlier releases which did not include the mod_ssl
  package are not vulnerable to this bug.  Users who utilize client
  certificate authentication are strongly advised to upgrade or switch to
  shared memory session cache, shmcb, which is not vulnerable to this issue.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2002-0082 to this issue.
