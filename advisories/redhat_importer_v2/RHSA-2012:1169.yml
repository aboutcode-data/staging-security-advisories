  - CVE-2012-3416
summary: |
  Updated condor packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Condor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive
  jobs. It provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority
  scheme, and resource monitoring and management.

  Condor installations that rely solely upon host-based authentication were
  vulnerable to an attacker who controls an IP, its reverse-DNS entry and has
  knowledge of a target site's security configuration. With this control and
  knowledge, the attacker could bypass the target site's host-based
  authentication and be authorized to perform privileged actions (i.e.
  actions requiring ALLOW_ADMINISTRATOR or ALLOW_WRITE). Condor deployments
  using host-based authentication that contain no hostnames (IPs or IP globs
  only) or use authentication stronger than host-based are not vulnerable.
  (CVE-2012-3416)

  Note: Condor will not run jobs as root; therefore, this flaw cannot lead to
  a compromise of the root user account.

  Red Hat would like to thank Ken Hahn and Dan Bradley for reporting this
  issue.

  All Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.1 users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  Condor must be restarted for the update to take effect.
