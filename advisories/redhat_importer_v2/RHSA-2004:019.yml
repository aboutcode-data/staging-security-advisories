  - CVE-2003-0991
summary: |
  Updated mailman packages that close a DoS vulnerability present in mailman
  versions prior to version 2.1 are now available.

  Mailman is a mailing list manager.

  Matthew Galgoci of Red Hat discovered a Denial of Service (DoS)
  vulnerability in versions of Mailman prior to 2.1.  An attacker could send
  a carefully-crafted message causing mailman to crash.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0991 to this issue.

  Users of Mailman are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which
  include a backported security fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank Barry Warsaw for providing a patch for this issue.
