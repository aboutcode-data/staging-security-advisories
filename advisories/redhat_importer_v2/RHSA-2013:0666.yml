summary: |
  Updates to the java-1.6.0-sun packages that disable the Java Web Browser
  Plug-in and Web Start included in these packages. As a result, customers
  who rely on Java-based browser applets may need to re-configure their
  browser to use one of the Java implementations listed in the Solution
  section below.

  Oracle Java SE version 6 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
  the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

  Oracle Java SE 6 will not receive updates after February 28, 2013. The
  Oracle Java SE 6 packages on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
  Supplementary media and in Red Hat Network (RHN) channels will continue to
  be available.

  Red Hat will continue to provide these packages only as a courtesy to
  customers. Red Hat will not provide updates to these packages after this
  date.

  Once customers update their system by installing the packages associated
  with this advisory, the Oracle Java Web Plug-in will be disabled. As a
  result, customers who rely on Java-based browser applets may need to
  re-configure their browser to use one of the Java implementations listed
  in the Solution section below.

  All users of java-1.6.0-sun are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages.
