  - CVE-2007-4743
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that correct a security flaw are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other through use of symmetric encryption
  and a trusted third party, the KDC.  kadmind is the KADM5 administration
  server.

  The MIT Kerberos Team discovered a problem with the originally published
  patch for svc_auth_gss.c (CVE-2007-3999).  A remote unauthenticated
  attacker who can access kadmind could trigger this flaw and cause kadmind
  to crash.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 it is not possible to exploit this
  flaw to run arbitrary code as the overflow is blocked by FORTIFY_SOURCE.
  (CVE-2007-4743)

  This issue did not affect the versions of Kerberos distributed with Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, or 4.

  Users of krb5-server are advised to update to these erratum packages which
  contain a corrected backported fix for this issue.
