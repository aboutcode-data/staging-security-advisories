summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  This Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0 release serves as a replacement for
  6.0.0. Refer to the 6.1.0 Release Notes for further information, available
  shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
  protected resource could bypass the CSRF prevention filter in JBoss Web. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to perform CSRF attacks against
  applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter. (CVE-2012-4431)

  When applications used the COOKIE session tracking method, the jsessionid
  would be appended as a query string parameter when processing the first
  request of a session. This could possibly lead to users' sessions being
  hijacked via man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-4529)

  If multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class
  name, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application
  to be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications
  using the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker
  could deploy a malicious application that provides implementations of
  custom authorization modules that apply authorization rules supplied by the
  attacker. (CVE-2012-4572)

  XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
  frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
  insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
  on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
  CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
  recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)

  Note: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when
  WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements, which is best
  practice.

  The data file used by PicketBox Vault to store encrypted passwords contains
  a copy of its own admin key. The file is encrypted using only this admin
  key, not the corresponding JKS key. A local attacker with permission to
  read the vault data file could read the admin key from the file.
  (CVE-2013-1921)

  A session fixation flaw was found in the Tomcat FormAuthenticator module.
  (CVE-2013-2067)

  When a JGroups channel was started, the JGroups diagnostics service was
  enabled by default with no authentication via IP multicast. An attacker on
  an adjacent network could exploit this flaw to read diagnostics
  information. (CVE-2013-2102)

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the Apache CXF StAX
  parser implementation processed certain XML files. A remote attacker could
  provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to
  excessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2013-2160)

  A flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java
  validated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an
  arbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the
  SignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an
  XML signature, via a specially-crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)

  A flaw was found in JGroup's DiagnosticsHandler that allowed an attacker on
  an adjacent network to reuse the credentials from a previous successful
  authentication. This could be exploited to read diagnostic information and
  attain limited remote code execution. (CVE-2013-4112)

  A flaw was discovered in the way authenticated connections were cached on
  the server by remote-naming. After a user has successfully logged in, a
  remote attacker could use a remoting client to log in as that user without
  knowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform actions
  with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-4128)

  A flaw was discovered in the way connections for remote EJB invocations via
  the EJB client API were cached on the server. After a user has successfully
  logged in, a remote attacker could use an EJB client to log in as that user
  without knowing their password. (CVE-2013-4213)
