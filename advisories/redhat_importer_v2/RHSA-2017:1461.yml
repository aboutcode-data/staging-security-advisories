  - CVE-2017-2673
summary: |
  An update for openstack-keystone is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities. The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style logins.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-keystone (9.3.0). (BZ#1427684)

  Security Fix(es):

  * An authorization-check flaw was discovered in federation configurations of the OpenStack Identity service (keystone). An authenticated federated user could request permissions to a project and unintentionally be granted all related roles including administrative roles. (CVE-2017-2673)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Openstack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Boris Bobrov (Mail.Ru) as the original reporter.
