summary: |
  An update for python27-python is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language, which includes modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the Python CGIHandler class did not properly protect against the HTTP_PROXY variable name clash in a CGI context. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a Python CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-1000110)

  * It was found that Python's smtplib library did not return an exception when StartTLS failed to be established in the SMTP.starttls() function. A man in the middle attacker could strip out the STARTTLS command without generating an exception on the Python SMTP client application, preventing the establishment of the TLS layer. (CVE-2016-0772)

  * It was found that the Python's httplib library (used by urllib, urllib2 and others) did not properly check HTTPConnection.putheader() function arguments. An attacker could use this flaw to inject additional headers in a Python application that allowed user provided header names or values. (CVE-2016-5699)

  Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting CVE-2016-1000110.
