  - CVE-2008-2641
summary: |
  Updated acroread packages that fix various security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Extras, 4 Extras, and 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Adobe Acrobat Reader allows users to view and print documents in Portable
  Document Format (PDF).

  An input validation flaw was discovered in a JavaScript engine used by
  Acrobat Reader. A malicious PDF file could cause Acrobat Reader to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Acrobat Reader.
  (CVE-2008-2641)

  An insecure temporary file usage issue was discovered in the Acrobat Reader
  "acroread" startup script. A local attacker could potentially overwrite
  arbitrary files that were writable by the user running Acrobat Reader, if
  the victim ran "acroread" with certain command line arguments.
  (CVE-2008-0883)

  All acroread users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, that
  contain Acrobat Reader version 8.1.2 Security Update 1, and are not
  vulnerable to these issues.
