  A Subscription Management tool for finding and reporting Red Hat product usage

  Red Hat Discovery, also known as Discovery, is an inspection and reporting tool that finds,
  identifies, and reports environment data, or facts, such as the number of physical and virtual
  systems on a network, their operating systems, and relevant configuration data stored within
  them. Discovery also identifies and reports more detailed facts for some versions of key
  Red Hat packages and products that it finds in the network.
