summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.2.0, JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.0, and JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0 that fixes multiple
  security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Web is a web container based on Apache Tomcat. It provides a single
  deployment platform for the JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet
  technologies.

  A flaw was found in the way JBoss Web handled UTF-8 surrogate pair
  characters. If JBoss Web was hosting an application with UTF-8 character
  encoding enabled, or that included user-supplied UTF-8 strings in a
  response, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service (infinite loop) on the JBoss Web server. (CVE-2011-4610)

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible
  to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  cause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP
  request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash
  value. This update introduces a limit on the number of parameters and
  headers processed per request to mitigate this issue. The default limit is
  512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by
  setting the org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and
  org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in
  "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/properties-service.xml". (CVE-2011-4858)

  It was found that JBoss Web did not handle large numbers of parameters and
  large parameter values efficiently. A remote attacker could make a JBoss
  Web server use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP request
  containing a large number of parameters or large parameter values. This
  update introduces limits on the number of parameters and headers processed
  per request to address this issue. Refer to the CVE-2011-4858 description
  for information about the org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT
  and org.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties.
  (CVE-2012-0022)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way JBoss Web handled HTTP DIGEST
  authentication. These flaws weakened the JBoss Web HTTP DIGEST
  authentication implementation, subjecting it to some of the weaknesses of
  HTTP BASIC authentication, for example, allowing remote attackers to
  perform session replay attacks. (CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-5062,
  CVE-2011-5063, CVE-2011-5064)

  A flaw was found in the way JBoss Web handled sendfile request attributes
  when using the HTTP APR (Apache Portable Runtime) or NIO (Non-Blocking I/O)
  connector. A malicious web application running on a JBoss Web instance
  could use this flaw to bypass security manager restrictions and gain access
  to files it would otherwise be unable to access, or possibly terminate the
  Java Virtual Machine (JVM). (CVE-2011-2526)

  Red Hat would like to thank NTT OSSC for reporting CVE-2011-4610; oCERT for
  reporting CVE-2011-4858; and the Apache Tomcat project for reporting
  CVE-2011-2526. oCERT acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the
  original reporters of CVE-2011-4858.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss installation,
  including any databases, applications, configuration files, and so on.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.2.0, JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.0, and JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
