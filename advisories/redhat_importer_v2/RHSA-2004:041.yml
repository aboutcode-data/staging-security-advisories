aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0056
  - CVE-2003-0848
summary: |
  Updated slocate packages are now available that fix vulnerabilities
  allowing a local user to gain "slocate" group privileges.

  Slocate is a security-enhanced version of locate, designed to find files on
  a system via a central database.

  Patrik Hornik discovered a vulnerability in Slocate versions up to and
  including 2.7 where a carefully crafted database could overflow a
  heap-based buffer.  A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain
  "slocate" group privileges and then read the entire slocate database.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2003-0848 to this issue.

  Users of Slocate should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain
  Slocate version 2.7 with the addition of a patch from Kevin Lindsay that
  causes slocate to drop privileges before reading a user-supplied database.

  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 these packages also fix a buffer overflow
  that affected unpatched versions of Slocate prior to 2.7.  This
  vulnerability could also allow a local user to gain "slocate" group
  privileges.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0056 to this issue.
