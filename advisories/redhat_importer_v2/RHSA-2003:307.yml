  - CVE-2003-0858
summary: |
  Updated zebra packages that close a locally-exploitable and a
  remotely-exploitable denial of service vulnerability are now available.

  Zebra an open source implementation of TCP/IP routing software.

  Jonny Robertson reported that Zebra can be remotely crashed if a Zebra
  password has been enabled and a remote attacker can connect to the Zebra
  telnet management port.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0795 to this issue.

  Herbert Xu reported that Zebra can accept spoofed messages sent on the
  kernel netlink interface by other users on the local machine.  This could
  lead to a local denial of service attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0858 to
  this issue.

  Users of Zebra should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain
  a patch preventing Zebra from crashing when it receives a telnet option
  delimiter without any option data, and a patch that checks that netlink
  messages actually came from the kernel.
