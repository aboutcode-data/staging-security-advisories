aliases:
  - CVE-2014-8159
  - CVE-2014-8867
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not
  properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from
  user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a
  /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,
  Important)

  * An insufficient bound checking flaw was found in the Xen hypervisor's
  implementation of acceleration support for the "REP MOVS" instructions.
  A privileged HVM guest user could potentially use this flaw to crash the
  host. (CVE-2014-8867, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting CVE-2014-8159, and the
  Xen project for reporting CVE-2014-8867.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Under memory pressure, cached data was previously flushed to the backing
  server using the PID of the thread responsible for flushing the data in the
  Server Message Block (SMB) headers instead of the PID of the thread which
  actually wrote the data. As a consequence, when a file was locked by the
  writing thread prior to writing, the server considered writes by the thread
  flushing the pagecache as being a separate process from writing to a locked
  file, and thus rejected the writes. In addition, the data to be written was
  discarded. This update ensures that the correct PID is sent to the server,
  and data corruption is avoided when data is being written from a client
  under memory pressure. (BZ#1169304)

  * This update adds support for new cryptographic hardware in toleration
  mode for IBM System z. (BZ#1182522)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
