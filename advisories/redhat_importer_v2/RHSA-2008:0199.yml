aliases:
  - CVE-2008-0892
summary: |
  An updated redhat-ds package that addresses a security issue is now
  available as Red Hat Directory Server 7.1, Service Pack 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server.

  A shell command injection flaw was discovered in the Red Hat Administration
  Server replication monitor CGI script used by Red Hat Directory Server 7.1.
  An attacker with access to the replication monitor web page could execute
  arbitrary shell commands with the "root" user privileges used by
  Administration Server. (CVE-2008-0892)

  Please note: simply installing the updated package does not correct the
  security issue for previously created instances of the Administration
  Server. After installation, the following steps must be manually performed
  to resolve the security issue:

  # cd /opt/redhat-ds
  # ./setup/setup -r

  For more information about Service Pack 5, including upgrade and
  installation instructions for users running Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 on
  Solaris, please refer to the Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 SP5 release
  notes, available at:

  http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/release-notes/7.1SP5/

  All users of Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 should upgrade to Service Pack 5,
  which resolves this issue.
