  - CVE-2010-3067
  - CVE-2010-3081
summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix two security issues and three bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * The compat_alloc_user_space() function in the Linux kernel 32/64-bit
  compatibility layer implementation was missing sanity checks. This function
  could be abused in other areas of the Linux kernel if its length argument
  can be controlled from user-space. On 64-bit systems, a local, unprivileged
  user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3081,
  Important)

  * A missing upper bound integer check was found in the sys_io_submit()
  function in the Linux kernel asynchronous I/O implementation. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause an information leak.
  (CVE-2010-3067, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hawkes for reporting CVE-2010-3081, and
  Tavis Ormandy for reporting CVE-2010-3067.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The RHSA-2010:0631 kernel-rt update resolved an issue (CVE-2010-2240)
  where, when an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently
  overwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault
  occurring. This update implements the official upstream fixes for that
  issue. Note: This is not a security regression. The original fix was
  complete. (BZ#624604)

  * In certain circumstances, under heavy load, certain network interface
  cards using the bnx2 driver, and configured to use MSI-X, could stop
  processing interrupts and then network connectivity would cease.
  (BZ#622952)

  * This update upgrades the tg3 driver to version 3.110. (BZ#640334)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for
  this update to take effect.
