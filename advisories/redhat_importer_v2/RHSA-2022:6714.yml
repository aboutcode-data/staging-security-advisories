summary: "Updated images are now available for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes\
  \ (RHACS). The updated image includes new features and bug fixes.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each\
  \ vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nRelease of RHACS 3.72 provides\
  \ these changes:\n\nNew features\n* Automatic removal of nonactive clusters from RHACS: RHACS\
  \ provides the ability to configure your system to automatically remove nonactive clusters\
  \ from RHACS so that you can monitor active clusters only. \n* Support for unauthenticated\
  \ email integration: RHACS now supports unauthenticated SMTP for email integrations. This\
  \ is insecure and not recommended.\n* Support for Quay robot accounts: RHACS now supports\
  \ use of robot accounts in quay.io integrations. You can create robot accounts in Quay that\
  \ allow you to share credentials for use in multiple repositories.\n* Ability to view Dockerfile\
  \ lines in images that introduced components with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs):\
  \ In the Images view, under Image Findings, you can view individual lines in the Dockerfile\
  \ that introduced the components that have been identified as containing CVEs.\n* Network\
  \ graph improvements: RHACS 3.72 includes some improvements to the Network Graph user interface.\n\
  \nKnown issue\n* RHACS shows the wrong severity when two severities exist for a single vulnerability\
  \ in a single distribution. This issue occurs because RHACS scopes severities by namespace\
  \ rather than component. There is no workaround. It is anticipated that an upcoming release\
  \ will include a fix for this issue. (ROX-12527)\n\nBug fixes\n* Before this update, the steps\
  \ to configure OpenShift Container Platform OAuth for more than one URI were missing. The\
  \ documentation has been revised to include instructions for configuring OAuth in OpenShift\
  \ Container Platform to use more than one URI. For more information, see Creating additional\
  \ routes for the OpenShift Container Platform OAuth server. (ROX-11296)\n* Before this update,\
  \ the autogenerated image integration, such as a Docker registry integration, for a cluster\
  \ is not deleted when the cluster is removed from Central. This issue is fixed. (ROX-9398)\n\
  * Before this update, the Image OS policy criteria did not support regular expressions, or\
  \ regex. However, the documentation indicated that regular expressions were supported. This\
  \ issue is fixed by adding support for regular expressions for the Image OS policy criteria.\
  \ (ROX-12301)\n* Before this update, the syslog integration did not respect a configured TCP\
  \ proxy. This is now fixed.\n* Before this update, the scanner-db pod failed to start when\
  \ a resource quota was set for the stackrox namespace, because the init-db container in the\
  \ pod did not have any resources assigned to it. The init-db container for ScannerDB now specifies\
  \ resource requests and limits that match the db container. (ROX-12291)\n\nNotable technical\
  \ changes\n* Scanning support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: RHEL 9 is now generally available\
  \ (GA). RHACS 3.72 introduces support for analyzing images built with Red Hat Universal Base\
  \ Image (UBI) 9 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 RPMs for vulnerabilities.\n* Policy\
  \ for CVEs with fixable CVSS of 6 or greater disabled by default: Beginning with this release,\
  \ the Fixable CVSS >= 6 and Privileged policy is no longer enabled by default for new RHACS\
  \ installations. The configuration of this policy is not changed when upgrading an existing\
  \ system. A new policy Privileged Containers with Important and Critical Fixable CVEs, which\
  \ gives an alert for containers running in privileged mode that have important or critical\
  \ fixable vulnerabilities, has been added.\n\nSecurity Fix(es)\n* golang: encoding/pem: fix\
  \ stack overflow in Decode (CVE-2022-24675)\n* golang: regexp: stack exhaustion via a deeply\
  \ nested expression (CVE-2022-24921)\n* golang: crypto/elliptic: panic caused by oversized\
  \ scalar (CVE-2022-28327)\n* golang: syscall: faccessat checks wrong group (CVE-2022-29526)\n\
  * golang: compress/gzip: stack exhaustion in Reader.Read (CVE-2022-30631)\n\nFor more details\
  \ about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other\
  \ related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section."
