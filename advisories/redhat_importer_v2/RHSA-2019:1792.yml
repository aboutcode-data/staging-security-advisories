aliases:
  - CVE-2018-19115
summary: |
  An update for keepalived is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The keepalived utility provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing and high availability. The load balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used IP Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing layer-4 (transport layer) load balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load balanced server pool according to the health of the servers. Keepalived also implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2) to achieve high availability with director failover.

  Security Fix(es):

  * keepalived: Heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes allows for denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-19115)
