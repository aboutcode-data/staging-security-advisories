summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes several security issues is
  now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
  messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
  to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
  overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
  the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2014-3466)

  It was discovered that the asn1_get_bit_der() function of the libtasn1
  library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
  crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
  an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

  Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
  libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
  libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
  asn1_read_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
  application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
  aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting CVE-2014-3466,
  CVE-2014-3468, CVE-2014-3467, and CVE-2014-3469. Upstream acknowledges
  Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon as the original reporter of CVE-2014-3466.

  This updated package provides an updated kernel component that includes
  fixes for various security issues. These issues have no security impact on
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security
  fixes included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2013-6378, CVE-2014-0203, CVE-2014-1737, CVE-2014-1738, CVE-2014-1874,
  CVE-2014-2039 and CVE-2014-3153 (kernel issues)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package.
