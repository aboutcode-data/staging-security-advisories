summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues is
  now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  Upgrade Note: If you upgrade Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  6.4 to version 6.5 through the 3.3 Manager administration portal,
  configuration of the previous system appears to be lost when reported in
  the TUI. However, this is an issue in the TUI itself, not in the upgrade
  process; the configuration of the system is not affected.

  A flaw was found in the way NSS handled invalid handshake packets. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to cause a TLS/SSL client using NSS to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2013-5605)

  A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL determined which hashing algorithm to
  use when TLS protocol version 1.2 was enabled. This could possibly cause
  OpenSSL to use an incorrect hashing algorithm, leading to a crash of an
  application using the library. (CVE-2013-6449)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled
  TLS/SSL protocol handshake packets. A specially crafted handshake packet
  could cause a TLS/SSL client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2013-4353)

  It was discovered that NSS did not reject certificates with incompatible
  key usage constraints when validating them while the verifyLog feature was
  enabled. An application using the NSS certificate validation API could
  accept an invalid certificate. (CVE-2013-5606)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting
  CVE-2013-5606. Upstream acknowledges Camilo Viecco as the original reporter
  of CVE-2013-5606.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2013-6462 (libXfont issue)

  CVE-2013-6629, and CVE-2013-6630 (libjpeg-turbo issues)

  CVE-2013-1739, CVE-2013-1741, and CVE-2013-5607 (nss, nspr issues)

  CVE-2013-6450 (openssl issue)

  CVE-2013-6425 (pixman issue)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
