summary: "Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues, multiple\nbugs,\
  \ and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.\n\nThe Red Hat Security\
  \ Response Team has rated this update as having moderate\nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available\
  \ for each vulnerability\nfrom the CVE links in the References section.\n\nThe openstack-keystone\
  \ packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation\nof the OpenStack identity service API,\
  \ which provides Identity, Token,\nCatalog, and Policy services.\n\nThe openstack-keystone\
  \ packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2012.2.1, which provides a number of bug\
  \ fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version. (BZ#883829)\n\nThis update also fixes\
  \ the following security issues:\n\nA flaw in Keystone allowed an attacker with access to\
  \ the web and network  \ninterfaces to continue using chained tokens linked to tokens that\
  \ had \nexpired. This would allow the attacker to continue using the tokens despite \nthe\
  \ parent token being expired, giving them continued access to OpenStack \nservices. (CVE-2012-5563)\n\
  \nIt was found that Keystone did not correctly handle users being removed\nfrom tenants when\
  \ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) style\ncredentials (credentials that are issued\
  \ in the same format as standard\nAmazon EC2 credentials) were in use. When a user was removed\
  \ from a tenant,\nthey retained the privileges provided by that tenant, allowing them to\n\
  access resources they should no longer have access to. (CVE-2012-5571)\n\nRed Hat would like\
  \ to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these\nissues. Upstream acknowledges Anndy\
  \ as the original reporter of\nCVE-2012-5563, and Vijaya Erukala as the original reporter\
  \ of\nCVE-2012-5571.\n\nAll users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated\n\
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After\ninstalling the updated\
  \ packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone)\nwill be restarted automatically."
