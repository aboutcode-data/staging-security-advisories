summary: "Updated nss, nss-util, and nss-softokn packages that contain a patch to\nmitigate\
  \ the CVE-2014-3566 issue, fix a number of bugs, and add various\nenhancements are now available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update\
  \ as having Important \nsecurity impact.\n\nNetwork Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries\
  \ designed to support\nthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server\n\
  applications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform\nindependence for non-GUI\
  \ operating system facilities.\n\nThis update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling\
  \ Cipher Suite Value\n(TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade\n\
  attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS\nprotocol version when\
  \ the initial connection indicating the highest\nsupported protocol version fails.\n\nThis\
  \ can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.\nThe SSL 3.0 protocol\
  \ was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle\nattack when using block cipher suites\
  \ in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nThis issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also\
  \ known under the alias\nPOODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future\n\
  update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to\nrequire at least TLS\
  \ protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.\n\nFor additional information about this\
  \ flaw, see the Knowledgebase article\nat https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123\n\nThe\
  \ nss, nss-util, and nss-softokn packages have been upgraded to upstream\nversion 3.16.2.3,\
  \ which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements\nover the previous version, and adds\
  \ the support for Mozilla Firefox 31.3.\n(BZ#1158159, BZ#1165003, BZ#1165525)\n\nUsers of\
  \ nss, nss-util, and nss-softokn are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages, which\
  \ contain a backported patch to mitigate the\nCVE-2014-3566 issue, fix these bugs, and add\
  \ these enhancements. After\ninstalling this update, applications using NSS or NSPR must be\
  \ restarted\nfor this update to take effect."
