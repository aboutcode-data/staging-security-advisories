  - CVE-2011-2196
summary: |
  Updated jboss-seam2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The JBoss Seam 2 framework is an application framework for building web
  applications in Java.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2011-1484 was incomplete: JBoss Seam 2
  did not block access to all malicious JBoss Expression Language (EL)
  constructs in page exception handling, allowing arbitrary Java methods to
  be executed. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code via a specially-crafted URL provided to certain applications based on
  the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly configured and enabled Java
  Security Manager would prevent exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2011-2196)

  Red Hat would like to thank the ObjectWorks+ Development Team at Nomura
  Research Institute for reporting this issue.

  Users of jboss-seam2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. Manual action is required for this update to take
  effect. Refer to the Solution section for details.
