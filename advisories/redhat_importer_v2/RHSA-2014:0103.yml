  - CVE-2014-1447
summary: |
  Updated libvirt packages that fix two security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the
  virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems.
  In addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of
  virtualized systems.

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way several libvirt block APIs
  handled domain jobs. A remote attacker able to establish a read-only
  connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the libvirtd
  process (usually root). (CVE-2013-6458)

  A race condition was found in the way libvirtd handled keepalive
  initialization requests when the connection was closed prior to
  establishing connection credentials. An attacker able to establish a
  read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd,
  resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2014-1447)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * A race condition was possible between a thread starting a virtual machine
  with a guest agent configured (regular start-up or while migrating) and a
  thread that was killing the VM process (or the process crashing). The race
  could cause the monitor object to be freed by the thread that killed the VM
  process, which was later accessed by the thread that was attempting to
  start the VM, resulting in a crash. This issue was fixed by checking the
  state of the VM after the attempted connection to the guest agent; if the
  VM in the meantime exited, no other operations are attempted. (BZ#1055578)

  All libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.
