  - CVE-2003-0427
summary: "Updated mikmod packages that fix a security issue are now available.\n\nThis update\
  \ has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\n\
  MikMod is a well known MOD music file player for UNIX-based systems.\n\nA buffer overflow\
  \ bug was found in mikmod during the processing of archive\nfilenames. An attacker could create\
  \ a malicious archive that when opened by\nmikmod could result in arbitrary code execution.\
  \ The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2003-0427\nto this issue. \n\nUsers of mikmod are advised to upgrade to these erratum\
  \ packages, which\ncontain backported security patches and are not vulnerable to these issues."
