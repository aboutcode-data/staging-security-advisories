  - CVE-2010-3170
summary: |
  Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the development of security-enabled client and server applications.

  A flaw was found in the way NSS matched SSL certificates when the
  certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
  address. NSS incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that fell
  within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
  possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
  (CVE-2010-3170)

  All NSS users should upgrade to these updated packages, which provide NSS
  version 3.12.8 to resolve this issue. After installing the update,
  applications using NSS must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
