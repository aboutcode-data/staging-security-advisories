summary: "An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several\nbugs is\
  \ now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the\
  \ Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Virtualization\n(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated\nKernel-based\
  \ Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything\nnecessary to run and manage virtual\
  \ machines: A subset of the Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat\
  \ Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel\
  \ 64 and AMD64\narchitectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the IPv6\
  \ Extension Header (EH) handling\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure\
  \ was not\nproperly validated in the ipv6_hop_jumbo() function. This could possibly\nlead\
  \ to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)\n\nThe Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team\
  \ reported two flaws in the routing\nimplementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large\
  \ enough number of\ncollisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for\n\
  the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if\nthe kernel routing\
  \ cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be\nleft behind after a route lookup,\
  \ leading to a kernel panic.\n(CVE-2009-4272)\n\nA flaw was found in each of the following\
  \ Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in\nthe Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using\
  \ packets larger\nthan the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in\npartial,\
  \ invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws\ncould also possibly be used\
  \ to trigger a remote denial of service.\n(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)\n\nA flaw was found\
  \ in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.\nReceiving overly-long frames\
  \ with a certain revision of the network cards\nsupported by this driver could possibly result\
  \ in a remote denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-4537)\n\nThe x86 emulator implementation was missing\
  \ a check for the Current\nPrivilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in\
  \ a guest\ncould leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or\npossibly\
  \ escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,\nCVE-2010-0306)\n\nA flaw was\
  \ found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access\nto the internal data structure\
  \ pit_state, which represents the data state\nof the emulated PIT, was not properly validated\
  \ in the pit_ioport_read()\nfunction. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash\
  \ the host.\n(CVE-2010-0309)\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include\
  \ fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV\nHypervisor.\
  \ These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,\nCVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556,\
  \ CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,\nCVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141;\
  \ ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;\ndbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;\n\
  gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue \nCVE-2010-0097; gzip issue\
  \ CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and \nCVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.\n\
  \nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* on systems with a large number of disk devices,\
  \ USB storage devices may\nget enumerated after \"/dev/sdz\", for example, \"/dev/sdcd\".\
  \ This was not\nhandled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing \"/dev/live\" symbolic\n\
  link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev\nrules correctly\
  \ handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number\nof disk devices, which resolves\
  \ this issue. (BZ#555083)\n\nAs RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM\
  \ update\nRHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html\n\
  \nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this\
  \ updated package, which corrects these issues."
