  - CVE-2013-6420
summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the openssl_x509_parse()
  function of the PHP openssl extension parsed X.509 certificates. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to provide a malicious self-signed certificate
  or a certificate signed by a trusted authority to a PHP application using
  the aforementioned function, causing the application to crash or, possibly,
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the PHP interpreter. (CVE-2013-6420)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PHP project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Stefan Esser as the original reporter of this issue.

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
