summary: "An updated gpdf package that fixes two security issues is now available.\n\nThis update\
  \ has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\
  \nGPdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files for GNOME. \n\nA buffer overflow\
  \ flaw was found in the Gfx::doImage function of Xpdf which\nalso affects GPdf due to a shared\
  \ codebase. An attacker could construct a\ncarefully crafted PDF file that could cause GPdf\
  \ to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code when opened. The Common Vulnerabilities and\n\
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1125 to\nthis issue.\n\n\
  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Decrypt::makeFileKey2 function of\nXpdf which also\
  \ affects GPdf due to a shared codebase. An attacker could\nconstruct a carefully crafted\
  \ PDF file that could cause GPdf to crash or\npossibly execute arbitrary code when opened.\
  \ The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2005-0064 to\nthis issue.\n\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans and others discovered\
  \ a number of\ninteger overflow bugs that affected all versions of Xpdf, which also\naffects\
  \ GPdf due to a shared codebase. An attacker could construct a\ncarefully crafted PDF file\
  \ that could cause GPdf to crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code when opened.  This issue\
  \ was assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0888 by The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n\
  (cve.mitre.org). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 contained a fix for this issue,\nbut it was found\
  \ to be incomplete and left 64-bit architectures vulnerable.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and\
  \ Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0206 to this issue.\n\n\
  Users should update to this erratum package which contains backported\npatches to correct\
  \ these issues."
