summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one security
  issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component can be used to build HTTP-aware
  client applications (such as web browsers and web service clients).

  The Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server
  hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
  subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
  man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate
  that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and
  configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
