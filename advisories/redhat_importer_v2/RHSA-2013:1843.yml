summary: |
  An update for the GateIn Portal component in Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0
  that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Portal is the open source implementation of the Java EE suite
  of services and Portal services running atop Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Middleware
  components that have been tested and certified together to provide an
  integrated experience.

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the GateIn Portal
  component. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the
  GateIn Portal interface, into visiting a specially crafted URL, it would
  lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's GateIn
  Portal session. (CVE-2013-4424)

  Red Hat would like to thank Cloud Technology Development Department, Ricoh
  Company, Ltd. for reporting this issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
