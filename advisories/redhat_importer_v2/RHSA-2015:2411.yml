summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's file system implementation
  handled rename operations in which the source was inside and the
  destination was outside of a bind mount. A privileged user inside a
  container could use this flaw to escape the bind mount and, potentially,
  escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-2925, Important)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPC
  subsystem initialized certain fields in an IPC object structure that were
  later used for permission checking before inserting the object into a
  globally visible list. A local, unprivileged user could potentially use
  this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-7613,
  Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel memory resource controller's (memcg)
  handling of OOM (out of memory) conditions could lead to deadlocks.
  An attacker able to continuously spawn new processes within a single
  memory-constrained cgroup during an OOM event could use this flaw to lock
  up the system. (CVE-2014-8171, Moderate)

  * A race condition flaw was found between the chown and execve system
  calls. When changing the owner of a setuid user binary to root, the race
  condition could momentarily make the binary setuid root. A local,
  unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3339, Moderate)

  * A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel's TTY subsystem handled
  the tty shutdown phase. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
  cause a denial of service on the system by holding a reference to the ldisc
  lock during tty shutdown, causing a deadlock. (CVE-2015-4170, Moderate)

  * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the SCTP implementation.
  A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service on the system
  by triggering a kernel panic when creating multiple sockets in parallel
  while the system did not have the SCTP module loaded. (CVE-2015-5283,
  Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Crypto subsystem handled
  automatic loading of kernel modules. A local user could use this flaw to
  load any installed kernel module, and thus increase the attack surface of
  the running kernel. (CVE-2013-7421, CVE-2014-9644, Low)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel changed
  certain segment registers and thread-local storage (TLS) during a context
  switch. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak the user
  space TLS base address of an arbitrary process. (CVE-2014-9419, Low)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled the securelevel
  functionality after performing a kexec operation. A local attacker could
  use this flaw to bypass the security mechanism of the
  securelevel/secureboot combination. (CVE-2015-7837, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Linn Crosetto of HP for reporting the
  CVE-2015-7837 issue. The CVE-2015-5283 issue was discovered by Ji Jianwen
  from Red Hat engineering.

  The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-326.rt56.204,
  which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements. (BZ#1201915,
  BZ#1211724)

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds multiple enhancements.
  Refer to the following Red Hat Knowledgebase article for information on the
  most significant of these changes:

  https://access.redhat.com/articles/2055783

  All kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
