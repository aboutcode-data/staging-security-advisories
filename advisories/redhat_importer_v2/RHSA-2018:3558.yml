summary: |
  An update for httpd24-httpd, httpd24-nghttp2, and httpd24-curl is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server. The httpd24 packages provide a recent stable release of version 2.4 of the Apache HTTP Server, along with the mod_auth_kerb module.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: httpd24-httpd (2.4.34), httpd24-curl (7.61.1). (BZ#1590833, BZ#1648928)

  Security Fix(es):

  * httpd: Improper handling of headers in mod_session can allow a remote user to modify session data for CGI applications (CVE-2018-1283)

  * httpd: Out of bounds read in mod_cache_socache can allow a remote attacker to cause DoS (CVE-2018-1303)

  * httpd: mod_http2: Too much time allocated to workers, possibly leading to DoS (CVE-2018-1333)

  * httpd: DoS for HTTP/2 connections by continuous SETTINGS frames (CVE-2018-11763)

  * httpd: Out of bounds write in mod_authnz_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values (CVE-2017-15710)

  * httpd: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name (CVE-2017-15715)

  * httpd: Out of bounds access after failure in reading the HTTP request (CVE-2018-1301)

  * httpd: Weak Digest auth nonce generation in mod_auth_digest (CVE-2018-1312)

  * curl: Multiple security issues were fixed in httpd24-curl (CVE-2016-5419, CVE-2016-5420, CVE-2016-5421, CVE-2016-7141, CVE-2016-7167, CVE-2016-8615, CVE-2016-8616, CVE-2016-8617, CVE-2016-8618, CVE-2016-8619, CVE-2016-8620, CVE-2016-8621, CVE-2016-8622, CVE-2016-8623, CVE-2016-8624, CVE-2016-8625, CVE-2016-9586, CVE-2017-1000100, CVE-2017-1000101, CVE-2017-1000254, CVE-2017-1000257, CVE-2017-7407, CVE-2017-8816, CVE-2017-8817, CVE-2018-1000007, CVE-2018-1000120, CVE-2018-1000121, CVE-2018-1000122, CVE-2018-1000301, CVE-2018-14618)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Curl project for reporting CVE-2017-8816, CVE-2017-8817, CVE-2017-1000254, CVE-2017-1000257, CVE-2018-1000007, CVE-2018-1000120, CVE-2018-1000122, CVE-2018-1000301, CVE-2016-9586, CVE-2017-1000100, CVE-2017-1000101, CVE-2018-14618, and CVE-2018-1000121. Upstream acknowledges Alex Nichols as the original reporter of CVE-2017-8816; the OSS-Fuzz project as the original reporter of CVE-2017-8817 and CVE-2018-1000301; Max Dymond as the original reporter of CVE-2017-1000254 and CVE-2018-1000122; Brian Carpenter and the OSS-Fuzz project as the original reporters of CVE-2017-1000257; Craig de Stigter as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000007; Duy Phan Thanh as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000120; Even Rouault as the original reporter of CVE-2017-1000100; Brian Carpenter as the original reporter of CVE-2017-1000101; Zhaoyang Wu as the original reporter of CVE-2018-14618; and Dario Weisser as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000121.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, the Apache HTTP Server from the httpd24 Software Collection was unable to handle situations when static content was repeatedly requested in a browser by refreshing the page. As a consequence, HTTP/2 connections timed out and httpd became unresponsive. This bug has been fixed, and HTTP/2 connections now work as expected in the described scenario. (BZ#1518737)

  Enhancement(s):

  * This update adds the mod_md module to the httpd24 Software Collection. This module enables managing domains across virtual hosts and certificate provisioning using the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. The mod_md module is available only for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. (BZ#1640722)
