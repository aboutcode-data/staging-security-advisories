  - CVE-2017-1000250
summary: |
  An update for bluez is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The bluez packages contain the following utilities for use in Bluetooth applications: hcitool, hciattach, hciconfig, bluetoothd, l2ping, start scripts (Red Hat), and pcmcia configuration files.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An information-disclosure flaw was found in the bluetoothd implementation of the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). A specially crafted Bluetooth device could, without prior pairing or user interaction, retrieve portions of the bluetoothd process memory, including potentially sensitive information such as Bluetooth encryption keys. (CVE-2017-1000250)

  Red Hat would like to thank Armis Labs for reporting this issue.
