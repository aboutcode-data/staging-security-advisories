summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG
  2.5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read
  and write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were
  already processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,
  potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array
  overrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system
  or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,
  Important)

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel keys
  management subsystem performed key garbage collection. A local attacker
  could attempt accessing a key while it was being garbage collected, which
  would cause the system to crash. (CVE-2014-9529, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's 32-bit emulation
  implementation handled forking or closing of a task with an 'int80' entry.
  A local user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges
  on the system. (CVE-2015-2830, Low)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's ISO file system implementation did
  not correctly limit the traversal of Rock Ridge extension Continuation
  Entries (CE). An attacker with physical access to the system could use this
  flaw to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, resulting in a denial of
  service. (CVE-2014-9420, Low)

  * An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ISO9660
  file system implementation accessed data on an ISO9660 image with RockRidge
  Extension Reference (ER) records. An attacker with physical access to the
  system could use this flaw to disclose up to 255 bytes of kernel memory.
  (CVE-2014-9584, Low)

  * A flaw was found in the way the nft_flush_table() function of the Linux
  kernel's netfilter tables implementation flushed rules that were
  referencing deleted chains. A local user who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN
  capability could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2015-1573, Low)

  * An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel randomized
  the stack for processes on certain 64-bit architecture systems, such as
  x86-64, causing the stack entropy to be reduced by four. (CVE-2015-1593,
  Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Carl Henrik Lunde for reporting CVE-2014-9420
  and CVE-2014-9584. The security impact of CVE-2015-1805 was discovered by
  Red Hat.

  This update provides a build of the kernel-rt package for Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG 2.5 that is layered on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and
  fixes the following issues:

  * storvsc: get rid of overly verbose warning messages
  * storvsc: force discovery of LUNs that may have been removed
  * storvsc: in responce to a scan event, scan the hos
  * storvsc: NULL pointer dereference fix
  * futex: Mention key referencing differences between shared and private
  futexes
  * futex: Ensure get_futex_key_refs() always implies a barrier
  * kernel module: set nx before marking module MODULE_STATE_COMING
  * kernel module: Clean up ro/nx after early module load failures
  * btrfs: make xattr replace operations atomic
  * megaraid_sas: revert: Add release date and update driver version
  * radeon: fix kernel segfault in hwmonitor

  (BZ#1223077)

  Bug fix:

  * There is an XFS optimization that depended on a spinlock to disable
  preemption using the preempt_disable() function. When CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT is
  enabled on realtime kernels, spinlocks do not disable preemption while
  held, so the XFS critical section was not protected from preemption.
  Systems on the Realtime kernel-rt could lock up in this XFS optimization
  when a task that locked all the counters was then preempted by a realtime
  task, causing all callers of that lock to block indefinitely. This update
  disables the optimization when building a kernel with
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_FULL enabled. (BZ#1217849)

  All kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
