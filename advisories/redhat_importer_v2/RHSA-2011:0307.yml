summary: |
  An updated mailman package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mailman is a program used to help manage email discussion lists.

  Multiple input sanitization flaws were found in the way Mailman displayed
  usernames of subscribed users on certain pages. If a user who is subscribed
  to a mailing list were able to trick a victim into visiting one of those
  pages, they could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the
  victim. (CVE-2011-0707)

  Multiple input sanitization flaws were found in the way Mailman displayed
  mailing list information. A mailing list administrator could use this flaw
  to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims viewing a
  list's "listinfo" page. (CVE-2008-0564, CVE-2010-3089)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mark Sapiro for reporting the CVE-2011-0707 and
  CVE-2010-3089 issues.

  Users of mailman should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to correct these issues.
