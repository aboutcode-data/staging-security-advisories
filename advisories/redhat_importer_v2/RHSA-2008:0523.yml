summary: |
  Red Hat Network Proxy Server version 4.2.3 is now available. This update
  includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network Proxy
  Server components.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Red Hat Network Proxy Server 4.2.3 release corrects several security
  vulnerabilities in several shipped components. In a typical operating
  environment, these components are not exposed to users of Proxy Server in a
  vulnerable manner. These security updates will reduce risk in unique Proxy
  Server environments.

  Multiple flaws were fixed in the Apache HTTPD server. These flaws could
  result in a cross-site scripting or denial-of-service attack.
  (CVE-2007-6388, CVE-2007-5000, CVE-2007-4465, CVE-2007-3304, CVE-2006-5752,
  CVE-2006-3918, CVE-2005-3352)

  A denial-of-service flaw was fixed in mod_perl. (CVE-2007-1349)

  Multiple flaws in mod_ssl. (CVE-2004-0488, CVE-2004-0700, CVE-2004-0885)

  A denial-of-service flaw was fixed in the jabberd server. (CVE-2006-1329)

  Users of Red Hat Network Proxy Server 4.2 are advised to upgrade to 4.2.3,
  which resolves these issues.
