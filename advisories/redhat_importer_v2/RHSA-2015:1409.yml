  - CVE-2014-9680
summary: "Updated sudo packages that fix one security issue, three bugs, and add one\nenhancement\
  \ are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated\
  \ this update as having Moderate security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\
  \ base score, which\ngives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\n\
  References section.\n\nThe sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system \nadministrators\
  \ to provide certain users with the permission to execute \nprivileged commands, which are\
  \ used for system management purposes, without \nhaving to log in as root.\n\nIt was discovered\
  \ that sudo did not perform any checks of the TZ\nenvironment variable value. If sudo was\
  \ configured to preserve the TZ\nenvironment variable, a local user with privileges to execute\
  \ commands via\nsudo could possibly use this flaw to achieve system state changes not\npermitted\
  \ by the configured commands. (CVE-2014-9680)\n\nNote: The default sudoers configuration in\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux removes\nthe TZ variable from the environment in which commands\
  \ run by sudo are\nexecuted.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously,\
  \ the sudo utility child processes could sometimes become\nunresponsive because they ignored\
  \ the SIGPIPE signal. With this update,\nSIGPIPE handler is properly restored in the function\
  \ that reads passwords\nfrom the user, and the child processes no longer ignore SIGPIPE. As\
  \ a\nresult, sudo child processes do not hang in this situation. (BZ#1094548)\n\n* Prior to\
  \ this update, the order in which sudo rules were processed did\nnot honor the user-defined\
  \ sudoOrder attribute. Consequently, sudo rules\nwere processed in an undefined order even\
  \ when the user defined the order\nin sudoOrder. The implementation of SSSD support in sudo\
  \ has been modified\nto sort the rules according to the sudoOrder value, and sudo rules are\
  \ now\nsorted in the order defined by the user in sudoOrder. (BZ#1138581)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ sudo became unresponsive after the user issued a command when\na sudoers source was mentioned\
  \ multiple times in the /etc/nsswitch.conf\nfile. The problem occurred when nsswitch.conf\
  \ contained, for example, the\n\"sudoers: files sss sss\" entry. The sudoers source processing\
  \ code has been\nfixed to correctly handle multiple instances of the same sudoers source.\n\
  As a result, sudo no longer hangs when a sudoers source is mentioned\nmultiple times in /etc/nsswitch.conf.\
  \ (BZ#1147498)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\n* The sudo utility\
  \ now supports I/O logs compressed using the zlib library.\nWith this update, sudo can generate\
  \ zlib compressed I/O logs and also\nprocess zlib compressed I/O logs generated by other versions\
  \ of sudo with\nzlib support. (BZ#1106433)\n\nAll sudo users are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add this\n\
  enhancement."
