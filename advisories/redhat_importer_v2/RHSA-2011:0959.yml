  - CVE-2011-1429
summary: |
  An updated mutt package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Mutt is a text-mode mail user agent.

  A flaw was found in the way Mutt verified SSL certificates. When a server
  presented an SSL certificate chain, Mutt could ignore a server hostname
  check failure. A remote attacker able to get a certificate from a trusted
  Certificate Authority could use this flaw to trick Mutt into accepting a
  certificate issued for a different hostname, and perform man-in-the-middle
  attacks against Mutt's SSL connections. (CVE-2011-1429)

  All Mutt users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue. All running instances of Mutt must
  be restarted for this update to take effect.
