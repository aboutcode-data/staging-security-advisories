  - CVE-2004-0808
summary: "Updated samba packages that fix two denial of service vulnerabilities are\nnow available.\n\
  \n[Updated 23rd September 2004]\nPackages have been updated to include the ppc64 packages\
  \ which were left\nout of the initial errata.\n\nSamba provides file and printer sharing services\
  \ to SMB/CIFS clients.\n\nThe Samba team has discovered a denial of service bug in the smbd\
  \ daemon. \nA defect in smbd's ASN.1 parsing allows an attacker to send a specially\ncrafted\
  \ packet during the authentication request which will send the newly\nspawned smbd process\
  \ into an infinite loop.  Given enough of these packets,\nit is possible to exhaust the available\
  \ memory on the server.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0807 to this issue.\n\nAdditionally the Samba team has also\
  \ discovered a denial of service bug in\nthe nmbd daemon.  It is possible that an attacker\
  \ could send a specially\ncrafted UDP packet which could allow the attacker to anonymously\n\
  crash nmbd.  This issue only affects nmbd daemons which are configured to\nprocess domain\
  \ logons.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2004-0808 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Samba should upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages, which contain an\nupgrade to Samba-3.0.7, which is not vulnerable to these issues."
