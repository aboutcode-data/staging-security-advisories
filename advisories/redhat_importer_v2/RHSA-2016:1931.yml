  This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.1. It includes several bug fixes, which are documented in the readme.txt file included with the patch files.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code
  added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a
  subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A
  man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using
  a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

  Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for installation instructions.
