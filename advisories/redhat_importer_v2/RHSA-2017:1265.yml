summary: |
  An update for samba is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the related Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allow PC-compatible machines to share files, printers, and various information.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that Samba always requested forwardable tickets when using Kerberos authentication. A service to which Samba authenticated using Kerberos could subsequently use the ticket to impersonate Samba to other services or domain users. (CVE-2016-2125)

  * A flaw was found in the way Samba handled PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) checksums. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash the winbindd process. (CVE-2016-2126)

  * A race condition was found in samba server. A malicious samba client could use this flaw to access files and directories, in areas of the server file system not exported under the share definitions. (CVE-2017-2619)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2017-2619. Upstream acknowledges Jann Horn (Google) as the original reporter of CVE-2017-2619.
