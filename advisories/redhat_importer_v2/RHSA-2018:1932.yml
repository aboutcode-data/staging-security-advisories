summary: |
  An update for zsh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The zsh shell is a command interpreter usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script command processor. Zsh resembles the ksh shell (the Korn shell), but includes many enhancements. Zsh supports command-line editing, built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and more.

  Security Fix(es):

  * zsh: Stack-based buffer overflow in gen_matches_files() at compctl.c (CVE-2018-1083)

  * zsh: buffer overflow when scanning very long directory paths for symbolic links (CVE-2014-10072)

  * zsh: buffer overrun in symlinks (CVE-2017-18206)

  * zsh: buffer overflow in utils.c:checkmailpath() can lead to local arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-1100)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  The CVE-2018-1083 and CVE-2018-1100 issues were discovered by Richard Maciel Costa (Red Hat).
