  workloads to be scaled using additional metrics sources other than pod metrics.

  toolset versions.

  This version makes use of newer tools and libraries to address the following

  golang: net/http, x/net/http2: unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames causes DoS (CVE-2023-45288)
  golang: html/template: errors returned from MarshalJSON methods may break template escaping (CVE-2024-24785)
