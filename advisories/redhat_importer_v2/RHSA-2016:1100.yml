summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's networking implementation handled UDP packets with incorrect checksum values. A remote attacker could potentially use these flaws to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the system, or cause a denial of service in applications using the edge triggered epoll functionality. (CVE-2015-5364, CVE-2015-5366, Important)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * In anon_vma data structure, the degree counts number of child anon_vmas and of VMAs that point to this anon_vma. In the unlink_anon_vma() function, when its list is empty, anon_vma is going to be freed whether the external refcount is zero or not, so the parent's degree should be decremented. However, failure to decrement the degree triggered a BUG_ON() signal in unlink_anon_vma(). The provided patch fixes this bug, and the degree is now decremented as expected. (BZ#1326027)

  Enhancement(s):

  * The ixgbe NIC driver has been upgraded to upstream version 4.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. Notably:

  NULL pointer crashes related to VLAN support have been fixed

  Two more devices from the Intel X550 Ethernet controller family are now supported: IDs 15AC and 15AD

  Several PHY-related problems have been addressed: link disruptions and link flapping

  Added PHY-related support for Intel X550

  System performance has been improved

  (BZ#1315702)
