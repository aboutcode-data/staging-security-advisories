summary: "Updated LPRng packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems\nresolve\
  \ a temporary file vulnerability and an insecure default.\n\nLPRng is a print spooler.  \n\
  \nLPRng includes a program, psbanner, that can be used to produce Postscript\nbanner pages\
  \ to separate print jobs.   A vulnerability has been found in\npsbanner, which creates a temporary\
  \ file with a known filename in an\ninsecure manner.  An attacker could create a symbolic\
  \ link and cause\narbitrary files to be written as the 'lp' user.  The Common Vulnerabilities\n\
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0136\nto this issue.\n\
  \nNote: psbanner is not used by the default Red Hat Linux LPRng configuration.\n\nWith its\
  \ default configuration, LPRng accepts job submissions from any\nhost, which is not appropriate\
  \ in a workstation environment. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0378 to this issue.\n\nThe updated packages from this advisory\
  \ change the job submission\npolicy (in /etc/lpd.perms) so that jobs from remote hosts are\
  \ refused\nby default and contain a patch so that psbanner does not create\nthe temporary\
  \ file.\n\nThose sites running print servers may want to adjust this policy as\nappropriate;\
  \ for example, to give access to certain hosts or subnets.\nRefer to the lpd.perms(5) man\
  \ page for details.\n\nNote: Default installations of Red Hat Linux 7.1 include ipchains rules\n\
  blocking remote access to the print spooler IP port; as a result default\ninstallations already\
  \ reject remote job submissions.  \n\nIMPORTANT: There are special instructions for installing\
  \ this update at\nthe end of the \"Solution\" section."
