summary: |
  An update for linux-firmware is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Telco Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The linux-firmware packages contain all of the firmware files that are required by various devices to operate.

  This update supersedes microcode provided by Red Hat with the CVE-2017-5715 (“Spectre”) CPU branch injection vulnerability mitigation. (Historically, Red Hat has provided updated microcode, developed by our microprocessor partners, as a customer convenience.) Further testing has uncovered problems with the microcode provided along with the “Spectre” mitigation that could lead to system instabilities. As a result, Red Hat is providing an microcode update that reverts to the last known good microcode version dated before 03 January 2018. Red Hat strongly recommends that customers contact their hardware provider for the latest microcode updates.

  IMPORTANT: Customers using Intel Skylake-, Broadwell-, and Haswell-based platforms must obtain and install updated microcode from their hardware vendor immediately. The "Spectre" mitigation requires both an updated kernel from Red Hat and updated microcode from your hardware vendor.
