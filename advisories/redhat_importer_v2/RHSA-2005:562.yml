summary: "Updated krb5 packages which fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\n[Updated 26 Sep 2005]\nkrb5-server packages\
  \ have been added to this advisory for Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 3 WS and Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 3 Desktop.\n\nKerberos is a networked authentication system which uses a trusted third\n\
  party (a KDC) to authenticate clients and servers to each other.\n\nA double-free flaw was\
  \ found in the krb5_recvauth() routine which may be\ntriggered by a remote unauthenticated\
  \ attacker.  Although no exploit is\ncurrently known to exist, this issue could potentially\
  \ be exploited to\nallow arbitrary code execution on a Key Distribution Center (KDC). The\n\
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name\nCAN-2005-1689 to this issue.\
  \ \n\nDaniel Wachdorf discovered a single byte heap overflow in the\nkrb5_unparse_name() function,\
  \ part of krb5-libs. Sucessful exploitation of\nthis flaw would lead to a denial of service\
  \ (crash). To trigger this flaw\nan attacker would need to have control of a kerberos realm\
  \ that shares a\ncross-realm key with the target, making exploitation of this flaw unlikely.\n\
  (CAN-2005-1175). \n\nGaël Delalleau discovered an information disclosure issue in the way\n\
  some telnet clients handle messages from a server. An attacker could\nconstruct a malicious\
  \ telnet server that collects information from the\nenvironment of any victim who connects\
  \ to it using the Kerberos-aware\ntelnet client (CAN-2005-0488).\n\nThe rcp protocol allows\
  \ a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside of the current directory.\
  \ This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses the Kerberos-aware rcp to\
  \ copy files from a\nmalicious server (CAN-2004-0175). \n\nAll users of krb5 should update\
  \ to these erratum packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Red\
  \ Hat would like to thank\nthe MIT Kerberos Development Team for their responsible disclosure\
  \ of these\nissues."
