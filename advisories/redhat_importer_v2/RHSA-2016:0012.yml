  - CVE-2015-7575
summary: |
  Updated gnutls packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

  A flaw was found in the way TLS 1.2 could use the MD5 hash function for
  signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a TLS
  handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to force a TLS connection to
  use the MD5 hash function could use this flaw to conduct collision attacks
  to impersonate a TLS server or an authenticated TLS client. (CVE-2015-7575)

  All gnutls users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all applications linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted.
