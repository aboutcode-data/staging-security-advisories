  - CVE-2010-3433
summary: |
  Updated postgresql packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
  (DBMS). PL/Perl and PL/Tcl allow users to write PostgreSQL functions in the
  Perl and Tcl languages. The PostgreSQL SECURITY DEFINER parameter, which
  can be used when creating a new PostgreSQL function, specifies that the
  function will be executed with the privileges of the user that created it.

  It was discovered that a user could utilize the features of the PL/Perl and
  PL/Tcl languages to modify the behavior of a SECURITY DEFINER function
  created by a different user. If the PL/Perl or PL/Tcl language was used to
  implement a SECURITY DEFINER function, an authenticated database user could
  use a PL/Perl or PL/Tcl script to modify the behavior of that function
  during subsequent calls in the same session. This would result in the
  modified or injected code also being executed with the privileges of the
  user who created the SECURITY DEFINER function, possibly leading to
  privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-3433)

  These updated postgresql packages upgrade PostgreSQL to version 8.4.5.
  Refer to the PostgreSQL Release Notes for a list of changes:

  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/release.html

  All PostgreSQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct this issue. If the postgresql service is running, it will be
  automatically restarted after installing this update.
