  - CVE-2002-0391
summary: "Updated Kerberos 5 packages are now available for Red Hat LInux Advanced\nServer.\
  \  These updates fix a buffer overflow in the XDR decoder.\n\nSun RPC is a remote procedure\
  \ call framework which allows clients to invoke\nprocedures in a server process over a network.\
  \  XDR is a mechanism for\nencoding data structures for use with RPC.  \n\nThe Kerberos 5\
  \ network authentication system contains an RPC library which\nincludes an XDR decoder derived\
  \ from Sun's RPC implementation. The Sun\nimplementation was recently demonstrated to be vulnerable\
  \ to a heap\noverflow.  It is believed that the attacker needs to be able to\nauthenticate\
  \ to the kadmin daemon for this attack to be successful.  No\nexploits are known to currently\
  \ exist.\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain an updated\nversion\
  \ of Kerberos 5 which is not vulnerable to this issue."
