  - CVE-2015-7704
summary: |
  Updated ntp packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 and 6.6 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
  with a referenced time source.

  It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check timestamps
  in Kiss-of-Death packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
  crafted Kiss-of-Death packet to an ntpd client that would increase the
  client's polling interval value, and effectively disable synchronization
  with the server. (CVE-2015-7704)

  Red Hat would like to thank Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon
  Goldberg of Boston University for reporting this issue.

  All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
  update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.
