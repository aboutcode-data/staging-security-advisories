summary: "Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 7.\n\nThe 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages include\
  \ the LDAP server and command-line utilities for server administration. \n\nThis update fixes\
  \ the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the code of search requests for asynchronous simple\
  \ paged\nresults was not thread-safe, which created a small window during which a conflict\
  \ could occur in the simple paged result slot. As a consequence, the server could terminate\
  \ unexpectedly. To fix this bug, the code is now thread-safe, and the crash no longer occurs\
  \ in this situation. \nIn addition, abandoning simple paged results request was previously\
  \ not handled correctly if an abandon request was issued too quickly. Consequently, an internal\
  \ search result object was in some cases not released. With this update, the search result\
  \ request is safely released regardless of the timing of the abandon request. (BZ#1230037)\n\
  \n* Prior to this update, a helper function to check whether the cache size is valid or not\
  \ was resetting the cash size to a very small value. Consequently, the helper function was\
  \ applied and the Distinguished Name (DN) cache was applied at the server start-up timing,\
  \ which reduced the cache size. With this update, the helper function provides only the validity\
  \ check and no longer resets the cache size. As a result, the entry and DN cache sizes do\
  \ not get affected by the helper function. (BZ#1230038)\n\n* Previously, when AD users had\
  \ multiple spaces inside the value of the RDN attribute, synchronizing the entry to the Directory\
  \ Server failed. The underlying source code has been fixed, and Windows Synchronization (WinSync)\
  \ plug-in in the Directory Server now works as expected. (BZ#1243718) \n\nUsers of 389-ds-base\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs. After installing\
  \ this update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically."
