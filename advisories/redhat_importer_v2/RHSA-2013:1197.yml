  - CVE-2013-4155
summary: |
  Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Swift (http://swift.openstack.org) is a highly available,
  distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store.

  A denial of service flaw in OpenStack Swift allowed attackers to fill the
  object server with object tombstones. This could lead to subsequent
  requests from legitimate users taking an excessive amount of time.
  (CVE-2013-4155)

  This issue was discovered by Peter Portante of Red Hat.

  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
  OpenStack Swift services will be restarted automatically.
