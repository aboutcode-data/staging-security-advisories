summary: |
  Updated Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.0 packages that
  fix two security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,
  6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5783 was incomplete: the code added
  to check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's
  Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
  using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153)

  It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted host name from
  an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially
  crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

  The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
  Product Security.

  For additional information on these flaws, refer to the Knowledgebase
  article in the References section.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
