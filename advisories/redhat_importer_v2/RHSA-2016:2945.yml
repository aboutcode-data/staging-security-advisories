  A security update is now available for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0 from the Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0 is a standalone server, based on the Keycloak project, that provides authentication and standards-based single sign-on capabilities for web and mobile applications.

  This asynchronous patch is a security update for Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that Keycloak did not implement authentication flow correctly. An attacker could use this flaw to construct a phishing URL, from which he could hijack the user's session. This could lead to information disclosure, or permit further possible attacks. (CVE-2016-8609)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hiroyuki Wada of Nomura Research Institute, Ltd for reporting this issue.
