summary: |
  Updated unzip packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The unzip utility is used to list, test, or extract files from a
  zip archive.

  A buffer overflow was found in the way unzip uncompressed certain extra
  fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive could cause unzip to
  crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when the archive was tested with
  unzip's '-t' option. (CVE-2014-9636)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way unzip computed the CRC32
  checksum of certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive
  could cause unzip to crash when the archive was tested with unzip's '-t'
  option. (CVE-2014-8139)

  An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the
  way unzip uncompressed certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted
  Zip archive could cause unzip to crash when the archive was tested with
  unzip's '-t' option. (CVE-2014-8140)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way unzip handled Zip64 files.
  A specially crafted Zip archive could possibly cause unzip to crash when
  the archive was uncompressed. (CVE-2014-8141)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-8139,
  CVE-2014-8140, and CVE-2014-8141 issues. oCERT acknowledges Michele
  Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team as the original reporter of
  these issues.

  All unzip users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
