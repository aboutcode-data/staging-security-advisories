  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5783 was incomplete: the code added
  to check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's
  Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
  using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153)

  It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted host name from
