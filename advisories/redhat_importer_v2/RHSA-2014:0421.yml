summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments
  managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  Multiple integer overflow, input validation, logic error, and buffer
  overflow flaws were discovered in various QEMU block drivers. An attacker
  able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could use these flaws to
  crash the guest, or corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, potentially
  resulting in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of
  the QEMU process. (CVE-2014-0143, CVE-2014-0144, CVE-2014-0145,
  CVE-2014-0147)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the virtio_net_handle_mac()
  function of QEMU processed guest requests to update the table of MAC
  addresses. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU
  process memory on the host, potentially resulting in arbitrary code
  execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
  (CVE-2014-0150)

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the seek_to_sector() function of the
  parallels block driver in QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image
  file loaded by a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest.
  (CVE-2014-0142)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the QCOW2 block driver in
  QEMU. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a guest could
  use this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-0146)

  It was found that the block driver for Hyper-V VHDX images did not
  correctly calculate BAT (Block Allocation Table) entries due to a missing
  bounds check. An attacker able to modify a disk image file loaded by a
  guest could use this flaw to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-0148)

  The CVE-2014-0143 issues were discovered by Kevin Wolf and Stefan Hajnoczi
  of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0144 issues were discovered by Fam Zheng, Jeff
  Cody, Kevin Wolf, and Stefan Hajnoczi of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0145 issues
  were discovered by Stefan Hajnoczi of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0150 issue was
  discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat, the CVE-2014-0142,
  CVE-2014-0146, and CVE-2014-0147 issues were discovered by Kevin Wolf of
  Red Hat, and the CVE-2014-0148 issue was discovered by Jeff Cody of
  Red Hat.

  All users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After
  installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all
  virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take
  effect.
