  - CVE-2010-0419
summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix two security issues and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
  the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  A flaw was found in the way the x86 emulator loaded segment selectors (used
  for memory segmentation and protection) into segment registers. In some
  guest system configurations, an unprivileged guest user could leverage this
  flaw to crash the guest or possibly escalate their privileges within the
  guest. (CVE-2010-0419)

  The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
  Privilege Level (CPL) while accessing debug registers. An unprivileged
  user in a guest could leverage this flaw to crash the guest.
  (CVE-2009-3722)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  With Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, the virtio_blk_dma_restart_bh()
  function was previously used to handle write errors; however, a bug fix
  provided by the RHSA-2009:1659 update meant that read errors would also
  have to be handled by this function. The function was not updated for this,
  causing read errors to be resubmitted as writes. This caused guest image
  corruption in some cases.

  Additionally, the return values of the bdrv_aio_write() and bdrv_aio_read()
  functions were ignored. If an immediate failure occurred in one of these
  functions, errors would be missed and the guest could hang or read
  corrupted data. (BZ#562776)

  All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The procedure in the
  Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.
