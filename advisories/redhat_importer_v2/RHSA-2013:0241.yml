  - CVE-2012-4544
summary: |
  Updated xen packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
  managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  A flaw was found in the way libxc, the Xen control library, handled
  excessively large kernel and ramdisk images when starting new guests. A
  privileged guest user in a para-virtualized guest (a DomU) could create a
  crafted kernel or ramdisk image that, when attempting to use it during
  guest start, could result in an out-of-memory condition in the privileged
  domain (the Dom0). (CVE-2012-4544)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.

  All users of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. After installing the updated packages, the xend service
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
