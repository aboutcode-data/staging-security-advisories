  - CVE-2013-1865
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues and
  various bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  It was found that Keystone did not correctly handle revoked PKI tokens,
  allowing users with revoked tokens to retain access to resources they
  should no longer be able to access. (CVE-2013-1865)

  A flaw was found in the way Keystone handled tenant names in token
  requests. A request containing an excessively long tenant name could cause
  Keystone to consume a large amount of CPU and memory. With this update,
  the maximum HTTP request size is limited to 112k. This can be changed via
  the "max_request_body_size" option in "/etc/keystone/keystone.conf".
  (CVE-2013-0270)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting the
  CVE-2013-1865 issue. Upstream acknowledges Guang Yee (HP) as the original
  reporter of CVE-2013-1865. The CVE-2013-0270 issue was discovered by Dan
  Prince of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes various bugs in the openstack-keystone packages.

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
  automatically.
