summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  The RHSA-2011:1243 Thunderbird update rendered HTTPS certificates signed by
  a certain Certificate Authority (CA) as untrusted, but made an exception
  for a select few. This update removes that exception, rendering every HTTPS
  certificate signed by that CA as untrusted. (BZ#735483)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves this issue. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
