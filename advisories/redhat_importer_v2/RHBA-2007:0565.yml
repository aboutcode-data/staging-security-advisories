  - CVE-2009-0786
summary: |
  Updated tcp_wrappers packages that fix several bugs are now available.

  The tcp_wrappers package provides small daemon programs which can monitor
  and filter incoming requests for systat, finger, FTP, telnet, rlogin, rsh,
  exec, tftp, talk and other network services. It also contains the libwrap
  library that adds the same filtering capabilities to programs linked
  against it, like sshd and more.

  This update brings the following changes:

  * localhost and localhost.localdomain are treated as being equivalent when
  comparing the client hostname and the list of allowed/denied hostnames.

  * the hosts_ctl function uses the address parameter to get the ip address
  and resolve it to symbolic hostname, if not given.

  * the behavior of signal handling when the "spawn" option is used has been
  changed to be transparent to the application using the library.

  These fixes correct the behavior of certain applications, including
  net-snmp and vsftpd.

  Users should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these issues.
