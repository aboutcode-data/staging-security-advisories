summary: "Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.6.0 Release - Container Images\n\nRed Hat Mobile\
  \ Application Platform (RHMAP) 4.6.0 consists of three main components:\n\n* Core - development\
  \ and management of apps occurs in the RHMAP Core, which can be installed either in an on-premise\
  \ installation of OpenShift Container Platform 3.x.\n\n* MBaaS - Application data, runtimes,\
  \ and integrations are deployed to the RHMAP MBaaS installed on OpenShift Container Platform\
  \ 3.x.\n\n* Build Farm - deployed separately from the Core and the MBaaS, the Build Farm is\
  \ shared between all instances of RHMAP. Third-party Linux, Windows, and Apple server hosting\
  \ providers are used to support building client app binaries for all platforms.\n\nThe Core\
  \ and MBaaS in RHMAP 4.6 are built on top of OpenShift Container Platform 3.x, Kubernetes,\
  \ and Red Hat Software Collections. The Core and MBaaS both consist of several components,\
  \ each running in its own container. Similarly, every cloud app deployed to the MBaaS runs\
  \ in a container. Those containers are deployed and orchestrated by Kubernetes.\n\nThis release\
  \ includes the option of provisioning a self-managed Build Farm on your infrastructure, to\
  \ build Client Apps without relying on hosted Build Farm. For prerequisites and installation\
  \ instructions, see the Installing RHMAP guide.\n\nFor this RHMAP release, the container images\
  \ required to run the Core and MBaaS inside OpenShift Container Platform 3.x are:\n\nrhmap46/fh-aaa:1.1.3-4\n\
