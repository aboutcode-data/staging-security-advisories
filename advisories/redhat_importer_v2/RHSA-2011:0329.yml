summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's RPC server sockets
  implementation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger a denial
  of service by sending a corrupted packet to a target system.
  (CVE-2011-0714, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Adam Prince for reporting this issue.

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported
  patch to correct this issue. The system must be rebooted for this update to
  take effect.
