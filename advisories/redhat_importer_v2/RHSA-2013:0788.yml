  - CVE-2012-6137
summary: |
  Updated subscription-manager packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The subscription-manager packages provide programs and libraries to allow
  users to manage subscriptions and yum repositories from the Red Hat
  Entitlement platform.

  It was discovered that the rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm tool did not verify
  the Red Hat Network Classic server's X.509 certificate when migrating
  system profiles registered with Red Hat Network Classic to
  Certificate-based Red Hat Network. An attacker could use this flaw to
  conduct man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing them to obtain the user's Red
  Hat Network credentials. (CVE-2012-6137)

  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security
  Team.

  All users of subscription-manager are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to fix this issue.
