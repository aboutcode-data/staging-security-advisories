  - CVE-2010-0188
summary: |
  Updated acroread packages that fix two security issues and a bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extras and Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Adobe Reader allows users to view and print documents in Portable Document
  Format (PDF).

  This update fixes two vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader. These
  vulnerabilities are summarized on the Adobe Security Advisory APSB10-07
  page listed in the References section. A specially-crafted PDF file could
  cause Adobe Reader to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the
  user running Adobe Reader when opened. (CVE-2010-0186, CVE-2010-0188)

  This update also fixes a bug where, on some systems, attempting to install
  or upgrade the acroread packages failed due to a package dependency issue.
  (BZ#557506)

  All Adobe Reader users should install these updated packages. They contain
  Adobe Reader version 9.3.1, which is not vulnerable to these issues and
  fixes this bug. All running instances of Adobe Reader must be restarted for
  the update to take effect.
