  - CVE-2006-4514
summary: |
  Updated libgsf packages that fix a buffer overflow flaw are now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The GNOME Structured File Library is a utility library for reading and
  writing structured file formats.

  A heap based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way GNOME Structured
  File Library processes and certain OLE documents. If an person opened a
  specially crafted OLE file, it could cause the client application to crash or
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2006-4514)

  Users of GNOME Structured File Library should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch that resolves this issue.
