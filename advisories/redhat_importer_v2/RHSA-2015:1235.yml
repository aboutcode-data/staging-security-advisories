  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
  Player web browser plug-in.

  This update fixes two vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
  vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-18
  listed in the References section.

  Two flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content.

  that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF content.
