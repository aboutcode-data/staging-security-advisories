  - CVE-2011-3638
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the way splitting two extents in
  ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() worked. A local, unprivileged user with
  the ability to mount and unmount ext4 file systems could use this flaw to
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3638, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Zheng Liu for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6, all devices that used the
  ixgbe driver would stop stripping VLAN tags when the device entered
  promiscuous mode. Placing a device in a bridge group causes the device to
  enter promiscuous mode. This caused various issues under certain
  configurations of bridging and VLANs. A patch has been provided to address
  this issue and the devices now properly strip VLAN tags in the driver
  whether in promiscuous mode or not. (BZ#809790)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
