  - CVE-2013-1927
summary: |
  Updated icedtea-web packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an
  implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It
  also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the
  plug-in and Web Start implementations.

  It was discovered that the IcedTea-Web plug-in incorrectly used the same
  class loader instance for applets with the same value of the codebase
  attribute, even when they originated from different domains. A malicious
  applet could use this flaw to gain information about and possibly
  manipulate applets from different domains currently running in the browser.
  (CVE-2013-1926)

  The IcedTea-Web plug-in did not properly check the format of the downloaded
  Java Archive (JAR) files. This could cause the plug-in to execute code
  hidden in a file in a different format, possibly allowing attackers to
  execute code in the context of web sites that allow uploads of specific
  file types, known as a GIFAR attack. (CVE-2013-1927)

  The CVE-2013-1926 issue was discovered by Jiri Vanek of the Red Hat OpenJDK
  Team, and CVE-2013-1927 was discovered by the Red Hat Security Response
  Team.

  This erratum also upgrades IcedTea-Web to version 1.2.3. Refer to the NEWS
  file, linked to in the References, for further information.

  All IcedTea-Web users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues. Web browsers using the IcedTea-Web browser plug-in
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
