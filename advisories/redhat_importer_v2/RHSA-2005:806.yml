  - CVE-2005-1111
summary: "An updated cpio package that fixes multiple issues is now available.\n\nThis update\
  \ has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\n\
  GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive. \n\nA race condition bug was found\
  \ in cpio. It is possible for a local\nmalicious user to modify the permissions of a local\
  \ file if they have write\naccess to a directory in which a cpio archive is being extracted.\
  \ The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCVE-2005-1111 to\
  \ this issue.\n\nIt was discovered that cpio uses a 0 umask when creating files using the\
  \ -O\n(archive) option. This creates output files with mode 0666 (all users can\nread and\
  \ write) regardless of the user's umask setting. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCVE-1999-1572 to this issue.\n\nAll users\
  \ of cpio are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported fixes\
  \ for these issues."
