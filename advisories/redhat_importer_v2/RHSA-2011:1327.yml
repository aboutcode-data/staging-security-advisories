  - CVE-2011-3193
summary: |
  An updated frysk package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  frysk is an execution-analysis technology implemented using native Java and
  C++. It provides developers and system administrators with the ability to
  examine and analyze multi-host, multi-process, and multithreaded systems
  while they are running. frysk is released as a Technology Preview for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in HarfBuzz, an OpenType text shaping
  engine used in the embedded Pango library. If a frysk application were used
  to debug or trace a process that uses HarfBuzz while it loaded a
  specially-crafted font file, it could cause the application to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the application. (CVE-2011-3193)

  Users of frysk are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue. All running frysk
  applications must be restarted for this update to take effect.
