aliases:
  - CVE-2001-1175
summary: |
  New util-linux packages are available for Red Hat Linux 7.1. These packages
  fix a problem where vipw would leave the /etc/shadow file world-readable
  after editing it.

  It is recommended that all users update to the fixed packages. Also, if you
  have used vipw on Red Hat Linux 7.1 before, make sure to run (as root):

  chmod 0400 /etc/shadow

  vipw, from the util-linux package in Red Hat Linux 7.1, included a new
  option that allowed editing of the /etc/shadow file as well as /etc/passwd.
  However, this option did not take measures to ensure that the file remained
  only readable by root.

  Thanks go to lloyd@acm.jhu.edu for bringing the problem to our attention.
