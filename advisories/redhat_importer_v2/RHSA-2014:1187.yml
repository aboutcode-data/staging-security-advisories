  - CVE-2014-0223
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4 and 5 for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments
  managed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform.

  Two integer overflow flaws were found in the QEMU block driver for QCOW
  version 1 disk images. A user able to supply a malicious image file to QEMU
  or to helper tools used in image conversion by services such as Glance and
  Nova could potentially use these flaws to cause memory corruption,
  resulting in a crash or possibly arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2014-0222,
  CVE-2014-0223)

  Red Hat would like to thank NSA for reporting these issues.

  All users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After
  installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all
  virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take
  effect.
