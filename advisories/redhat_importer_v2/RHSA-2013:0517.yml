  - CVE-2013-0157
summary: |
  Updated util-linux-ng packages that fix one security issue, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The util-linux-ng packages contain a large variety of low-level system
  utilities that are necessary for a Linux operating system to function.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in the way the mount command
  reported errors. A local attacker could use this flaw to determine the
  existence of files and directories they do not have access to.
  (CVE-2013-0157)

  These updated util-linux-ng packages include numerous bug fixes and
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
  of these changes.

  All users of util-linux-ng are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements.
