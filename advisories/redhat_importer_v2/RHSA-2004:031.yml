  - CVE-2003-0924
summary: "Updated NetPBM packages are available that fix a number of temporary file\nvulnerabilities\
  \ in the netpbm libraries.\n\nThe netpbm package contains a library of functions that support\n\
  programs for handling various graphics file formats, including .pbm\n(portable bitmaps), .pgm\
  \ (portable graymaps), .pnm (portable anymaps),\n.ppm (portable pixmaps), and others.\n\n\
  A number of temporary file bugs have been found in versions of NetPBM. \nThese could make\
  \ it possible for a local user to overwrite or create files\nas a different user who happens\
  \ to run one of the the vulnerable utilities. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0924 to this issue.\n\nUsers are advised\
  \ to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain patches\nfrom Debian that correct these\
  \ bugs."
