  - CVE-2004-0175
summary: "Updated rsh packages that fix a theoretical security issue are now available.\n\n\
  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response\
  \ Team\n\nThe rsh package contains a set of programs that allow users to run\ncommands on\
  \ remote machines, login to other machines, and copy files\nbetween machines, using the rsh,\
  \ rlogin, and rcp commands. All three of\nthese commands use rhosts-style authentication.\n\
  \nThe rcp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside\
  \ of the current directory.  This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses\
  \ rcp to copy files from a malicious server. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0175 to this issue.\n\nAll users of rsh\
  \ should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues."
