summary: |
  Updated Satellite 6.2 packages that fix several bugs are now available.

  Red Hat Satellite is a system management solution that allows organizations to configure and maintain their systems without the necessity to provide public Internet access to their servers or other client systems. It performs provisioning and configuration management of predefined standard operating environments.

  This update adds the following features:

  * Satellite 6.2.2 adds additional tooling around bulk subscription management via the user interface and command line. (BZ#1188796, BZ#1267313, BZ#1296978, BZ#1316703, BZ#1366437)

  * The discovery plug-in is now enabled by default at install time. (BZ#1318538)

  * Satellite 6.2.2. allows users to search job invocations based on the host that is affected. (BZ#1331660)

  * Multiple subscriptions of the same type can now be assigned to the same activation key. (BZ#1343067)

  * The maximum core and memory limits have been increased. (BZ#1368450)

  This update fixes the following bugs:

  * Several bugs around upgrading from 6.1 have been resolved. (BZ#1336365, BZ#1361785, BZ#1364778, BZ#1365299)

  * The performance and actions of content view promotion have been improved. (BZ#1161643, BZ#1231369, BZ#1275183, BZ#1117753, BZ#1185838)

  * Hosts provisioned in a distinct domain from an IDM server could not be registered. The correct options were added to the provisioning templates to allow this to work. (BZ#1209838)

  * Several foreman-debug bugs have been fixed. (BZ#1370224, BZ#1274694)

  * The admin role could not be assigned to a user group via hammer. This role can now be assigned. (BZ#1281300)

  * When integrated with IPA, Satellite did not return an error when hammer was used to update a host. The calls to IPA are now encoded correctly. (BZ#1281687)

  * Parameter value processing caused errors in Puppet because of faulty YAML. The parameter system has been enhanced in order to handle additional cases. (BZ#1315282, BZ#1332625)

  * The host collection API was not utilizing the host_id fields. The API has been enhanced with this data. (BZ#1325989)

  * The main sync page threw errors upon completion of sync if Capsules were non-responsive. The Capsule communication checking has been improved. (BZ#1326038, BZ#1327292)

  * Publishing or promoting a Puppet content view failed with an obtuse error. The publishing process has been updated to avoid this error. (BZ#1332596)

  * The katello-remove-orphan job was producing error messages incorrectly which corrupted the emails which were sent. This no longer occurs. (BZ#1334650)

  * An unused Puppet class counter was causing database locks. This counter has been removed. (BZ#1336007)

  * Re-Registering host with uppercase host name errors 'Name has already been taken'. The look-up logic will now not take case into consideration. (BZ#1361309)

  * Custom products, when imported, were not creating subscriptions correctly. The subscriptions are now created and associated properly. (BZ#1362194)

  * Network interface names could include JavaScript resulting in a XSS exploit. This possibility has been removed. (BZ#1364235)

  * Satellite was misspelled in the installer usage message. The typo has been fixed. (BZ#1364900)

  * Derived pools for VDC subscriptions were not showing the correct content. The correct repositories are now shown. (BZ#1366327)

  Users of Red Hat Satellite are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs.
