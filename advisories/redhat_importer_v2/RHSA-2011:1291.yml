  - CVE-2011-2729
summary: |
  A jsvc update for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  jsvc is a service wrapper that allows Java applications to be run as
  daemons.

  It was found that jsvc did not correctly drop capabilities after starting
  an application. If an administrator used jsvc to run an application, and
  also used the "-user" option to specify a user for it to run as, the
  application correctly ran as that user but did not drop its increased
  capabilities, allowing it access to all files and directories accessible to
  the root user. (CVE-2011-2729)

  Note: This flaw only affected users running JBoss Enterprise Web Server
  1.0.2 from jboss-ews-1.0.2-RHEL4-[arch].zip as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal, as versions for other products are not built with
  capabilities support.

  All users running JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 are advised to apply
  this update.
