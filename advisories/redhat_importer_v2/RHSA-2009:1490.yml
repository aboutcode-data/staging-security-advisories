  - CVE-2009-2964
summary: |
  An updated squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

  Form submissions in SquirrelMail did not implement protection against
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker tricked a
  user into visiting a malicious web page, the attacker could hijack that
  user's authentication, inject malicious content into that user's
  preferences, or possibly send mail without that user's permission.
  (CVE-2009-2964)

  Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct these issues.
