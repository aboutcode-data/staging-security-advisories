  - CVE-2003-0282
summary: |
  Updated unzip packages resolving a vulnerability allowing arbitrary files
  to be overwritten are now available.

  [Updated 15 August 2003]
  Ben Laurie found that the original patch to fix this issue missed a case
  where the path component included a quoted slash. These updated packages
  contain a new patch that corrects this issue.

  The unzip utility is used for manipulating archives, which are multiple
  files stored inside of a single file.

  A vulnerabilitiy in unzip version 5.50 and earlier allows attackers to
  overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction by placing invalid
  (non-printable) characters between two "." characters. These non-printable
  characters are filtered, resulting in a ".." sequence. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0282 to this issue.

  This erratum includes a patch ensuring that non-printable characters do not
  make it possible for a malicious .zip file to write to parent directories
  unless the "-:" command line parameter is specified.

  Users of unzip are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which are
  not vulnerable to this issue.
