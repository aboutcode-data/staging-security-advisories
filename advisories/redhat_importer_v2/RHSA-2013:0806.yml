  - CVE-2013-2006
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and various
  bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2012.2.4,
  which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#950132)

  This update also fixes the following security issue:

  In environments using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), if
  debug-level logging was enabled (for example, by enabling it in
  "/etc/keystone/keystone.conf"), the LDAP server password was logged in
  plain text to a world-readable log file. Debug-level logging is not enabled
  by default. (CVE-2013-2006)

  Additionally, this update also fixes the following bugs:

  * If the Keystone service incurred an HTTP error as a result of a transient
  network error, authentication tokens were listed as invalid. With this
  update, the Keystone service will now retry requests a few times before
  failing, which masks transient network errors. (BZ#919526)

  * The "/var/log/keystone/" directory was world-readable. With this update,
  world-read permissions have been removed. (BZ#956474)

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
  automatically.
