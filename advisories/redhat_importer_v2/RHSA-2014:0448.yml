summary: |
  An updated firefox package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2014-1518, CVE-2014-1524, CVE-2014-1529, CVE-2014-1531)

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox resolved hosts in
  certain circumstances. An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2014-1532)

  An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded JPEG
  images. Loading a web page containing a specially crafted JPEG image could
  cause Firefox to crash. (CVE-2014-1523)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled browser navigations through
  history. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause the address bar
  of the browser to display a web page name while loading content from an
  entirely different web page, which could allow for cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2014-1530)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary
  Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd, Christian Holler,
  Abhishek Arya, Mariusz Mlynski, moz_bug_r_a4, Nils, Tyson Smith, and Jesse
  Schwartzentrube as the original reporters of these issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 24.5.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  Firefox version 24.5.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
