summary: |
  Updated curl packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  cURL provides the libcurl library and a command line tool for downloading
  files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

  It was found that libcurl could incorrectly reuse existing connections for
  requests that should have used different or no authentication credentials,
  when using one of the following protocols: HTTP(S) with NTLM
  authentication, LDAP(S), SCP, or SFTP. If an application using the libcurl
  library connected to a remote server with certain authentication
  credentials, this flaw could cause other requests to use those same
  credentials. (CVE-2014-0015, CVE-2014-0138)

  Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Paras Sethia as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-0015 and Yehezkel Horowitz for discovering the security impact of
  this issue, and Steve Holme as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0138.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the libcurl library was closing a network socket without
  first terminating the SSL connection using the socket. This resulted in a
  write after close and consequent leakage of memory dynamically allocated by
  the SSL library. An upstream patch has been applied on libcurl to fix this
  bug. As a result, the write after close no longer happens, and the SSL
  library no longer leaks memory. (BZ#1092479)

  * Previously, the libcurl library did not implement a non-blocking SSL
  handshake, which negatively affected performance of applications based on
  libcurl's multi API. To fix this bug, the non-blocking SSL handshake has
  been implemented by libcurl. With this update, libcurl's multi API
  immediately returns the control back to the application whenever it cannot
  read/write data from/to the underlying network socket. (BZ#1092480)

  * Previously, the curl package could not be rebuilt from sources due to an
  expired cookie in the upstream test-suite, which runs during the build. An
  upstream patch has been applied to postpone the expiration date of the
  cookie, which makes it possible to rebuild the package from sources again.
  (BZ#1092486)

  * Previously, the libcurl library attempted to authenticate using Kerberos
  whenever such an authentication method was offered by the server. This
  caused problems when the server offered multiple authentication methods and
  Kerberos was not the selected one. An upstream patch has been applied on
  libcurl to fix this bug. Now libcurl no longer uses Kerberos authentication
  if another authentication method is selected. (BZ#1096797)

  All curl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  applications that use libcurl have to be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
