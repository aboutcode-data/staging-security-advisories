  - CVE-2005-0206
summary: "Updated cups packages that fix a security issue are now available.\n\nThis update\
  \ has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\
  \nThe Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is a print spooler.\n\nDuring a source code audit,\
  \ Chris Evans discovered a number of integer\noverflow bugs that affect Xpdf.  CUPS contained\
  \ a copy of the Xpdf code\nused for parsing PDF files and was therefore affected by these\
  \ bugs.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the\n\
  name CAN-2004-0888 to this issue, and Red Hat released erratum\nRHSA-2004:543 with updated\
  \ packages.\n\nIt was found that the patch used to correct this issue was not sufficient\n\
  and did not fully protect CUPS running on 64-bit architectures.  The Common\nVulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0206 to this issue.\
  \ \n\nThese updated packages also include a fix that prevents the CUPS\ninitscript from being\
  \ accidentally replaced.\n\nAll users of CUPS on 64-bit architectures should upgrade to these\
  \ updated\npackages, which contain a corrected patch and are not vulnerable to these\nissues."
