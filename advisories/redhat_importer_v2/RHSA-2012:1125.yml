summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0, which fixes multiple security issues,
  various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 serves as a replacement
  for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.2.0. It includes various bug fixes and
  enhancements which are detailed in the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0
  Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote
  write access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to
  access the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,
  delete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,
  application-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
  arrays (hashes) in JRuby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
  inputs to a JRuby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
  a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
  could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
  take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization
  has been added to the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker
  successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2011-4838)

  Note: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of
  the scripting_chain quickstart example application. The CVE-2011-4838 flaw
  is not exposed unless the version of JRuby shipped with that quickstart is
  used by a deployed, custom application.

  It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
  attacks. If a remote attacker submitted a request containing an external
  XML entity to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing
  the attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
  (Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. The fix for this issue is not
  enabled by default. Refer to the Solution section for details.
  (CVE-2012-0818)

  Multiple flaws were found in the Oracle OpenSSO authentication and
  administration components. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
  affect the integrity and availability of a service that uses Oracle
  OpenSSO. (CVE-2011-3506, CVE-2011-3517, CVE-2012-0079)

  Note: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform only provides Oracle OpenSSO as part of
  the opensso quickstart example application. The CVE-2011-3506,
  CVE-2011-3517, and CVE-2012-0079 flaws are not exposed unless the opensso
  quickstart example application is deployed, or you have created and
  deployed a custom application that is packaged with a copy of Oracle
  OpenSSO as provided by the opensso quickstart.

  The opensso quickstart has been removed in this release to address these
  flaws. Users interested in continuing to receive updates for their custom
  applications using Oracle OpenSSO are advised to contact Oracle as Red Hat
  is no longer supporting OpenSSO.

  When a JGroups channel is started, the JGroups diagnostics service would be
  enabled by default with no authentication. This service is exposed via IP
  multicast. An attacker on an adjacent network could exploit this flaw to
  read diagnostics information. (CVE-2012-2377)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting
  CVE-2011-4605, and oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4838. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
  CVE-2011-4838.

  Warning: Before installing version 5.3.0, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise SOA Platform installation (including its databases,
  applications, configuration files, and so on).
