  - CVE-2013-2157
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and various
  bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  A flaw was found in the way Keystone handled LDAP (Lightweight Directory
  Access Protocol) based authentication. If Keystone was configured to use
  LDAP authentication, and the LDAP server was configured to allow anonymous
  binds (anonymous binds is a common default), anyone able to connect to a
  given service using Keystone could connect as any user, including the
  admin, without supplying a password. (CVE-2013-2157)

  Red Hat would like to thank Thierry Carrez of OpenStack upstream for
  reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jose Castro Leon of CERN as
  the original reporter.

  These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.1.2,
  which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#972660)

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
  automatically.
