summary: |
  Helix Player contains multiple security flaws and should no longer be used.
  This update removes the HelixPlayer package from Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Helix Player is a media player.

  Multiple security flaws were discovered in RealPlayer. Helix Player and
  RealPlayer share a common source code base; therefore, some of the flaws
  discovered in RealPlayer may also affect Helix Player. Some of these flaws
  could, when opening, viewing, or playing a malicious media file or stream,
  lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
  Helix Player. (CVE-2010-2997, CVE-2010-4375, CVE-2010-4378, CVE-2010-4379,
  CVE-2010-4382, CVE-2010-4383, CVE-2010-4384, CVE-2010-4385, CVE-2010-4386,
  CVE-2010-4392)

  The Red Hat Security Response Team is unable to properly determine the
  impact or fix all of these issues in Helix Player, due to the source code
  for RealPlayer being unavailable.

  Due to the security concerns this update removes the HelixPlayer package
  from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4. Users wishing to continue to use Helix
  Player should download it directly from https://player.helixcommunity.org/
