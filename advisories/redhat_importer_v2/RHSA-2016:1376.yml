summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
  automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
  existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
  CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
  execution speed and quality.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that JGroups did not require necessary headers for encrypt and auth protocols from new nodes joining the cluster. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass security restrictions, and use this vulnerability to send and receive messages within the cluster, leading to information disclosure, message spoofing, or further possible attacks. (CVE-2016-2141)

  * It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

  * It was found that the Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL) allowed the processing of untrusted XML documents to utilize external entity references, which could access resources on the host system and, potentially, allowing arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2015-0254)

  * A flaw was discovered in the way applications using Groovy used the standard Java serialization mechanism. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted serialized object that would execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)

  * A deserialization flaw allowing remote code execution was found in the BeanShell library. If BeanShell was on the classpath, it could permit code execution if another part of the application deserialized objects involving a specially constructed chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the BeanShell library. (CVE-2016-2510)

  The CVE-2016-2141 issue was discovered by Dennis Reed (Red Hat).
