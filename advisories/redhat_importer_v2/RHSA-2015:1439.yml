  - CVE-2015-4142
summary: |
  An updated wpa_supplicant package that fixes one security issue and adds
  one enhancement is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The wpa_supplicant package contains an 802.1X Supplicant with support for
  WEP, WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and various EAP authentication
  methods. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator for client
  stations and controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication and
  association of the WLAN driver.

  An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer over-read, was found in the
  way wpa_supplicant handled WMM Action frames. A specially crafted frame
  could possibly allow an attacker within Wi-Fi radio range to cause
  wpa_supplicant to crash. (CVE-2015-4142)

  This update includes the following enhancement:

  * Prior to this update, wpa_supplicant did not provide a way to require the
  host name to be listed in an X.509 certificate's Common Name or Subject
  Alternative Name, and only allowed host name suffix or subject substring
  checks. This update introduces a new configuration directive,
  'domain_match', which adds a full host name check. (BZ#1186806)

  All wpa_supplicant users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to correct this issue and adds this
  enhancement. After installing this update, the wpa_supplicant service will
  be restarted automatically.
