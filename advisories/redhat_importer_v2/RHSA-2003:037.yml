  - CVE-2002-1384
summary: |
  Updated Xpdf packages are now available that fix a vulnerability in which a
  maliciously-crafted pdf document could run arbitrary code.

  [Updated 16 April 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  Xpdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.

  During an audit of CUPS, a printing system, Zen Parsec found an integer
  overflow vulnerability in the pdftops filter.  Since the code for pdftops
  is taken from the Xpdf project, all versions of Xpdf including 2.01 are
  also vulnerable to this issue.  An attacker could create a PDF
  file that could execute arbitrary code.  This could would have the same
  access privileges as the user who viewed the file with Xpdf.

  All users of Xpdf are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages.  For
  Red Hat Linux 8.0 we have included new packages based on Xpdf 1.01 with a
  patch to correct this issue.  For Red Hat Linux 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 we
  have upgraded Xpdf to version 1.00 with a patch to correct this issue.  For
  Red Hat Linux 6.2 we have upgraded Xpdf to version 0.92 with a patch to
  correct this issue.
