  A resource consumption issue was found in the way Xerces-J handled XML
  declarations. A remote attacker could use an XML document with a specially
  crafted declaration using a long pseudo-attribute name that, when parsed
  by an application using Xerces-J, would cause that application to use an
  excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2013-4002)
