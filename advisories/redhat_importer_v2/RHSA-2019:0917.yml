  - CVE-2017-15139
summary: "An update for openstack-cinder is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0\
  \ (Newton).\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact\
  \ of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References\
  \ section.\n\nOpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the presentation\
  \ of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend physical storage can consist of\
  \ local disks, or Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition,\
  \ Block Storage supports volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations.\
  \ Programmatic management is available via Block Storage's API.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n*\
  \ openstack-cinder: Data retained after deletion of a ScaleIO volume (CVE-2017-15139)\n\n\
  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments,\
  \ and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\
  \nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, image operations in cinder failed due to file I/O issues.\n\
  \nWith this update, you can create volumes from an image in cinder without file I/O issues.\
  \ (BZ#1476213)\n\n* Previously, the cinder logs contained fixed_key value.\n\nWith this update,\
  \ the fixed_key value is not logged. (BZ#1655742)\n\n* Previously, it was not possible to\
  \ attach a volume on the host due to an issue with 3PAR driver and Fibre Channel World Wide\
  \ Name. \n\nWith this update, you can attach Fibre Channel volumes even with a wrong host\
  \ configuration at the backend. (BZ#1667997)\n\n* Previously, only admin users could set the\
  \ Volume Type in the glance image using cinder_img_vol_type custom property.\n\nWith this\
  \ update, non-admin users can also set the Volume Type in a glance image. (BZ#1671260)"
