  - CVE-2005-0087
summary: "An updated alsa-lib package that fixes a flaw that disabled stack execution\nprotection\
  \ is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ important security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nThe alsa-lib package\
  \ provides a library of functions for communication with\nkernel sound drivers.\n\nA flaw\
  \ in the alsa mixer code was discovered that caused stack\nexecution protection to be disabled\
  \ for the libasound.so library.  \nThe effect of this flaw is that stack execution protection,\
  \ through NX or\nExec-Shield, would be disabled for any application linked to libasound. \n\
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0087\
  \ to this issue\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a\n\
  patched version of the library which correctly enables stack execution\nprotection."
