  - CVE-2011-4608
summary: |
  An update for the mod_cluster native component for JBoss Enterprise Web
  Server 1.0.2 that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The mod_cluster native component provides a native build of mod_cluster for
  the Apache HTTP Server (httpd). mod_cluster is an httpd-based load
  balancer. Like mod_jk, it uses a communication channel to forward requests
  from httpd to an application server node.

  It was found that mod_cluster allowed worker nodes to register on any
  virtual host (vhost), regardless of the security constraints applied to
  other vhosts. In a typical environment, there will be one vhost configured
  internally for worker nodes, and another configured externally for serving
  content. A remote attacker could use this flaw to register an
  attacker-controlled worker node via an external vhost that is not
  configured to apply security constraints, then use that worker node to
  serve malicious content, intercept credentials, and hijack user sessions.
  (CVE-2011-4608)

  This update also upgrades mod_cluster to version 1.0.10.GA_CP02.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
