summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other through use of symmetric encryption
  and a trusted third party, the KDC.

  A flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos Authentication Service and Key
  Distribution Center server (krb5kdc) handled Kerberos v4 protocol packets.
  An unauthenticated remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
  krb5kdc daemon, disclose portions of its memory, or possibly execute
  arbitrary code using malformed or truncated Kerberos v4 protocol
  requests. (CVE-2008-0062, CVE-2008-0063)

  This issue only affected krb5kdc with Kerberos v4 protocol compatibility
  enabled, which is the default setting on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.
  Kerberos v4 protocol support can be disabled by adding "v4_mode=none"
  (without the quotes) to the "[kdcdefaults]" section of
  /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf.

  A flaw was found in the RPC library used by the MIT Kerberos kadmind
  server. An unauthenticated remote attacker could use this flaw to crash
  kadmind. This issue only affected systems with certain resource limits
  configured and did not affect systems using default resource limits used by
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 or 3. (CVE-2008-0948)

  Red Hat would like to thank MIT for reporting these issues.

  All krb5 users are advised to update to these erratum packages which
  contain backported fixes to correct these issues.
