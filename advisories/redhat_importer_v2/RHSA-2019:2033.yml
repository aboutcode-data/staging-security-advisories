summary: |
  An update for patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).

  Security Fix(es):

  * patch: Out-of-bounds access in pch_write_line function in pch.c (CVE-2016-10713)

  * patch: Double free of memory in pch.c:another_hunk() causes a crash (CVE-2018-6952)
