  - CVE-2005-2917
summary: "An updated squid package that fixes a security vulnerability as well as\nseveral issues\
  \ is now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the\
  \ Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSquid is a high-performance proxy caching server for\
  \ Web clients,\nsupporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects.\n\nA denial of service flaw\
  \ was found in the way squid processes certain NTLM\nauthentication requests. It is possible\
  \ for a remote attacker to crash the\nSquid server by sending a specially crafted NTLM authentication\
  \ request.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned\nthe\
  \ name CVE-2005-2917 to this issue.\n\nThe following issues have also been fixed in this update:\
  \ \n\n* An error introduced in squid-2.5.STABLE6-3.4E.12 can crash Squid when a\n  user visits\
  \ a site that has a bit longer DNS record.\n\n* An error introduced in the old package prevented\
  \ Squid from returning\n  correct information about large file systems. The new package is\
  \ compiled\n  with the IDENT lookup support so that users who want to use it do not\n  have\
  \ to recompile it.\n\n* Some authentication helpers needed SETUID rights but did not have\
  \ them.\n  If administrators wanted to use cache administrator, they had to change\n  the\
  \ SETUID bit manually. The updated package sets this bit so the new\n  package can be updated\
  \ without manual intervention from administrators.\n\n* Squid could not handle a reply from\
  \ an HTTP server when the reply began\n  with the new-line character. \n\n* An issue was discovered\
  \ when a reply from an HTTP server was not\n  HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 compliant.\n\n* The updated\
  \ package keeps user-defined error pages when the package\n  is updated and it adds new ones.\n\
  \ \nAll users of squid should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues."
