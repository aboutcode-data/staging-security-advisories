  - CVE-2010-3072
summary: |
  An updated squid package that fixes one security issue and two bugs is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
  supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  It was found that string comparison functions in Squid did not properly
  handle the comparisons of NULL and empty strings. A remote, trusted web
  client could use this flaw to cause the squid daemon to crash via a
  specially-crafted request. (CVE-2010-3072)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * A small memory leak in Squid caused multiple "ctx: enter level" messages
  to be logged to "/var/log/squid/cache.log". This update resolves the memory
  leak. (BZ#666533)

  * This erratum upgrades Squid to upstream version 3.1.10. This upgraded
  version supports the Google Instant service and introduces various code
  improvements. (BZ#639365)

  Users of squid should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these
  issues. After installing this update, the squid service will be restarted
  automatically.
