  - CVE-2003-0028
summary: "Updated glibc packages are available to fix an integer overflow in the XDR\ndecoder.\n\
  \nThe glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by\nmultiple programs on the\
  \ system.  Sun RPC is a remote procedure call\nframework which allows clients to invoke procedures\
  \ in a server process\nover a network.  XDR is a mechanism for encoding data structures for\
  \ use\nwith RPC.  NFS, NIS, and many other network services are built upon Sun\nRPC.  The\
  \ XDR encoder/decoder provided with glibc, derived from Sun's RPC\nimplementation, was demonstrated\
  \ to be vulnerable to an integer overflow.\n\nAn integer overflow is present in the xdrmem_getbytes()\
  \ function of glibc\n2.3.1 and earlier.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability\n\
  could cause buffer overflows and may be exploitable, leading to arbitrary\ncode execution.\
  \  \n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain patches to\nthe glibc\
  \ libraries and, therefore, are not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank\
  \ eEye Digital Security for alerting us to this\nissue."
