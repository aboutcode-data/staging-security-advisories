summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 patch 4, which fixes three security issues and one
  bug, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides an
  integration platform. Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.0.0, based on Apache ActiveMQ,
  is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in
  mission critical applications.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse/A-MQ 6.0.0 patch 4 is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse
  6.0.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.0.0. This update addresses the following
  security issues:

  Restlet applications which use ObjectRepresentation to map HTTP request
  data directly to an object deserialize arbitrary user-provided XML using
  XMLDecoder. It was found that XMLDecoder deserialized an attacker-provided
  definition of a class and executed its methods. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code execution in the context of the
  server running the Restlet application. (CVE-2013-4221)

  A flaw was found in the way Restlet handled deserialization. Restlet
  applications which use ObjectRepresentation to map HTTP request data
  directly to an object deserialize arbitrary user-provided serialized
  data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the
  deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server.
  This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the
  deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-4271)

  A flaw was found in Apache Camel's parsing of the FILE_NAME header. A
  remote attacker able to submit messages to a Camel route, which would write
  the provided message to a file, could provide expression language (EL)
  expressions in the FILE_NAME header, which would be evaluated on the
  server. This could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the context
  of the Camel server process. (CVE-2013-4330)

  The CVE-2013-4271 issue was discovered by David Jorm of the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  This update also corrected a problem with installing JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 patch
  3.  When the pax-url-maven-commons bundle was installed in the container,
  the installation would fail with a null pointer error.  With this update,
  the installation does not fail.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.0.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this patch.
