  - CVE-2005-1705
summary: |
  An updated gdb package that fixes various bugs is now available.

  GDB, the GNU debugger, allows debugging of programs written in C, C++,
  and other languages, by executing them in a controlled fashion, and then
  printing their data.

  This updated package addresses the following issues:

  - GDB on ia64 had previously implemented a bug fix to work-around a kernel
  problem when creating a core file via gcore.  The bug fix caused a
  significant slow-down of gcore.

  - GDB on Itanium issued an extraneous warning when gcore was used.

  - GDB on Itanium could not successfully do an info frame for a signal
  trampoline.

  - GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T had problems attaching to a 32-bit process.

  - GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T was not properly handling threaded watchpoints.

  - GDB could not build with gcc4 when -Werror flag was set.

  - GDB had problems printing inherited members of C++ classes.

  - A few updates from mainline sources concerning Dwarf2 partial die in
  cache support, follow-fork support, interrupted syscall support, and
  DW_OP_piece read support.

  All users of gdb should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  these issues.
