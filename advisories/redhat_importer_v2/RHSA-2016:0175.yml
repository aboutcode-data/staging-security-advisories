  - CVE-2015-7547
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name
  Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
  Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the libresolv library
  performed dual A/AAAA DNS queries. A remote attacker could create a
  specially crafted DNS response which could cause libresolv to crash or,
  potentially, execute code with the permissions of the user running the
  library. Note: this issue is only exposed when libresolv is called from the
  nss_dns NSS service module. (CVE-2015-7547)

  This issue was discovered by the Google Security Team and Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The dynamic loader has been enhanced to allow the loading of more shared
  libraries that make use of static thread local storage. While static thread
  local storage is the fastest access mechanism it may also prevent the
  shared library from being loaded at all since the static storage space is a
  limited and shared process-global resource. Applications which would
  previously fail with "dlopen: cannot load any more object with static TLS"
  should now start up correctly. (BZ#1291270)

  * A bug in the POSIX realtime support would cause asynchronous I/O or
  certain timer API calls to fail and return errors in the presence of large
  thread-local storage data that exceeded PTHREAD_STACK_MIN in size
  (generally 16 KiB). The bug in librt has been corrected and the impacted
  APIs no longer return errors when large thread-local storage data is
  present in the application. (BZ#1301625)

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
