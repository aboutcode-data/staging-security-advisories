  - CVE-2004-0523
summary: |
  Updated Kerberos 5 (krb5) packages which correct buffer overflows in the
  krb5_aname_to_localname function are now available.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system.

  Bugs have been fixed in the krb5_aname_to_localname library function.
  Specifically, buffer overflows were possible for all Kerberos versions up
  to and including 1.3.3. The krb5_aname_to_localname function translates a
  Kerberos principal name to a local account name, typically a UNIX username.
  This function is frequently used when performing authorization checks.

  If configured with mappings from particular Kerberos principals to
  particular UNIX user names, certain functions called by
  krb5_aname_to_localname will not properly check the lengths of buffers
  used to store portions of the principal name.  If configured to map
  principals to user names using rules, krb5_aname_to_localname would
  consistently write one byte past the end of a buffer allocated from the
  heap.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0523 to this issue.

  Only configurations which enable the explicit mapping or rules-based
  mapping functionality of krb5_aname_to_localname() are vulnerable.
  These configurations are not the default.

  Users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which
  contain backported security patches to correct these issues.
