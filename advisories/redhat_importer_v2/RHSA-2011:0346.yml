  - CVE-2011-1024
summary: |
  Updated openldap packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol) applications and development tools.

  A flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP handled authentication failures being
  passed from an OpenLDAP slave to the master. If OpenLDAP was configured
  with a chain overlay and it forwarded authentication failures, OpenLDAP
  would bind to the directory as an anonymous user and return success, rather
  than return failure on the authenticated bind. This could allow a user on a
  system that uses LDAP for authentication to log into a directory-based
  account without knowing the password. (CVE-2011-1024)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, multiple concurrent connections to an OpenLDAP server could
  cause the slapd service to terminate unexpectedly with an assertion error.
  This update adds mutexes to protect multiple threads from accessing a
  structure with a connection, and the slapd service no longer crashes.
  (BZ#677611)

  Users of OpenLDAP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this update,
  the OpenLDAP daemons will be restarted automatically.
