  - CVE-2013-7440
summary: "Updated python27 packages are now available as a part of Red Hat Software Collections\
  \ 2.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\
  \ which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE\
  \ link(s) in the References section.\n\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented\
  \ programming language that supports modules, classes, exceptions, high-level dynamic data\
  \ types, and dynamic typing. The python27 packages provide a stable release of Python 2.7\
  \ with a number of additional utilities and database connectors for MySQL and PostgreSQL.\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\nThe following fix was applied to the python component:\n\n* The Python\
  \ standard library HTTP client modules (such as httplib or urllib) did not perform verification\
  \ of TLS/SSL certificates when connecting to HTTPS servers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could\
  \ use this flaw to hijack connections and eavesdrop or modify transferred data. (CVE-2014-9365)\n\
  \nNote: The Python standard library was updated to make it possible to enable certificate\
  \ verification by default. However, for backwards compatibility, verification remains disabled\
  \ by default. Future updates may change this default. Refer to the Knowledgebase article 2039753\
  \ linked to in the References section for further details about this change. (BZ#1311044,\
  \ BZ#1319774)\n\nThe following fix was applied to the python-pymongo component:\n\n* A denial\
  \ of service flaw was found in the way Python's SSL module implementation performed matching\
  \ of certain certificate names. A remote attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that\
  \ contained multiple wildcard characters could use this flaw to issue a request to validate\
  \ such a certificate, resulting in excessive consumption of CPU. (CVE-2013-2099)\n\nThe following\
  \ fix was applied to the python-pymongo and python-virtualenv components:\n\n* Multiple flaws\
  \ were found in the way Python's SSL module performed matching of certificate names containing\
  \ wildcards. A remote attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained certain names\
  \ with wildcards could have them incorrectly accepted by Python SSL clients, not following\
  \ the RFC 6125 recommendations. (CVE-2013-7440)\n\nThe CVE-2013-2099 issue was discovered\
  \ by Florian Weimer (Red Hat Product Security).\n\nBug Fix(es) and Enhancement(s):\n\nThe\
  \ python27 Software Collection has been updated to a later version, which provides a number\
  \ of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. Among others: \n\n* The python27-PyYAML\
  \ package has been added, which contains a Python YAML module. PyYAML is a YAML parser and\
  \ emitter for Python; it is applicable for a broad range of tasks from complex configuration\
  \ files to object serialization and persistance. \n\n* Network security enhancements, described\
  \ in the Python Enhancent Proposal 466, have been backported to the Python standard library.\
  \ The security enhancements include, for example, new features in the ssl module, such as\
  \ support for Server Name Indication (SNI) as well as support for new TLSv1.x protocols, new\
  \ hash algorithms in the hashlib module, and much more. \n\n* The python27-python-pip package\
  \ has been upgraded to version 7.1.0. \n\n* The python27-python-virtualenv package has been\
  \ upgraded to verion 13.1.0. \n\n* The python27-python-pymongo package has been upgraded to\
  \ version 3.2.1. \n\n(BZ#1301481, BZ#1297784, BZ#1111464, BZ#1319774)"
