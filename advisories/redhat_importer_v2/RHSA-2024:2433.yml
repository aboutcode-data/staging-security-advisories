summary: |
  An update for avahi is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Avahi is an implementation of the DNS Service Discovery and Multicast DNS specifications for Zero Configuration Networking. It facilitates service discovery on a local network. Avahi and Avahi-aware applications allow you to plug your computer into a network and, with no configuration, view other people to chat with, view printers to print with, and find shared files on other computers.

  Security Fix(es):

  * avahi: Reachable assertion in avahi_dns_packet_append_record (CVE-2023-38469)

  * avahi: Reachable assertion in avahi_escape_label (CVE-2023-38470)

  * avahi: Reachable assertion in dbus_set_host_name (CVE-2023-38471)

  * avahi: Reachable assertion in avahi_rdata_parse (CVE-2023-38472)

  * avahi: Reachable assertion in avahi_alternative_host_name (CVE-2023-38473)
