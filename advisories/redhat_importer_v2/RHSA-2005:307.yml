  - CVE-2005-0396
summary: |
  Updated kdelibs packages that fix a local denial of service issue are now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kdelibs package provides libraries for the K Desktop Environment.

  Sebastian Krahmer discovered a flaw in dcopserver, the KDE Desktop
  Communication Protocol (DCOP) daemon.  A local user could use this flaw to
  stall the DCOP authentication process, affecting any local desktop users
  and causing a reduction in their desktop functionality.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2005-0396 to this issue.

  Users of KDE should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
