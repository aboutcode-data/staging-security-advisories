  - CVE-2011-3205
summary: |
  An updated squid package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
  supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Squid parsed replies from
  remote Gopher servers. A remote user allowed to send Gopher requests to a
  Squid proxy could possibly use this flaw to cause the squid child process
  to crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the squid user,
  by making Squid perform a request to an attacker-controlled Gopher server.
  (CVE-2011-3205)

  Users of squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this update, the
  squid service will be restarted automatically.
