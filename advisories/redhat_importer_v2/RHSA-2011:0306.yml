  - CVE-2011-0719
summary: |
  Updated samba3x packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information.

  A flaw was found in the way Samba handled file descriptors. If an attacker
  were able to open a large number of file descriptors on the Samba server,
  they could flip certain stack bits to "1" values, resulting in the Samba
  server (smbd) crashing. (CVE-2011-0719)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba team for reporting this issue.

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
