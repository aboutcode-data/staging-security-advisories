  - CVE-2007-5079
summary: |
  An updated gdm package that fixes one security issue and one bug is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) is a configurable re-implementation of XDM,
  the X Display Manager. GDM allows you to log in to your system with the X
  Window System running, and supports running several different X sessions on
  your local machine at the same time.

  A flaw was found in the way the gdm package was built. The gdm package was
  missing TCP wrappers support on 64-bit platforms, which could result in an
  administrator believing they had access restrictions enabled when they did
  not. (CVE-2007-5079)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * sometimes the system would hang instead of properly shutting down when
  a user chose "Shut down" from the login screen. (BZ#625818)

  All users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains backported
  patches to correct these issues. GDM must be restarted for this update to
  take effect. Rebooting achieves this, but changing the runlevel from 5 to 3
  and back to 5 also restarts GDM.
