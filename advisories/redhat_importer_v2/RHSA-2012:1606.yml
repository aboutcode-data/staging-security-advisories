  - CVE-2011-4461
summary: |
  Fuse Management Console 7.1.0, which fixes one security issue, various
  bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Fuse Management Console is used for managing Fuse ESB Enterprise and
  Fuse MQ Enterprise deployments.

  This release of Fuse Management Console 7.1.0 serves as a replacement for
  Fuse Management Console 1.0.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
  Refer to the Fuse Management Console 7.1.0 Release Notes for information on
  the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available
  shortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible
  to predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  cause the Jetty HTTP server (a component of Apache Karaf, used by Fuse
  Management Console) to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an
  HTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same
  hash value. This update introduces a limit of 1000 on the number of
  parameters processed per request to mitigate this issue. (CVE-2011-4461)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT
  acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters.

  All users of Fuse Management Console 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse Management Console 7.1.0.
