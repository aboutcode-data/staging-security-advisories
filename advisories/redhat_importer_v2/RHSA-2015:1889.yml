summary: |
  An updated spice-server package that fixes two security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a
  virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with
  network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
  viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
  (KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way SPICE handled
  certain guest QXL commands related to surface creation. A user in a guest
  could use this flaw to read and write arbitrary memory locations on the
  host. (CVE-2015-5261)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way spice handled
  certain QXL commands related to the "surface_id" parameter. A user in a
  guest could use this flaw to crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process.
  (CVE-2015-5260)

  These issues were discovered by Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat.

  All spice-server users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains backported patches to correct these issues.
