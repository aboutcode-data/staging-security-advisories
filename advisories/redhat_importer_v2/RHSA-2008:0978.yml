summary: |
  An updated firefox package that fixes various security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2008-0017, CVE-2008-5014, CVE-2008-5016, CVE-2008-5017,
  CVE-2008-5018, CVE-2008-5019, CVE-2008-5021)

  Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. A web
  site containing specially-crafted content could potentially trick a Firefox
  user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-5022,
  CVE-2008-5023, CVE-2008-5024)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox opened "file:" URIs. If a file: URI was
  loaded in the same tab as a chrome or privileged "about:" page, the file:
  URI could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2008-5015)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
  security advisories for Firefox 3.0.4. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section.

  All firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches that correct these issues.
