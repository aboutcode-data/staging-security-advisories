aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0354
summary: |
  A ghostscript package fixing a command execution vulnerability is now
  available.

  GNU Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language, and is often
  used when printing to printers that do not have their own built-in
  PostScript interpreter.

  A flaw has been discovered in the way Ghostscript validates some PostScript
  commands.  This flaw allows an attacker to force commands to be executed by
  a print spooler by submitting a malicious print job. Note that using the
  -dSAFER option is not sufficient to prevent command execution.

  Users of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which are not vulnerable to this issue.
