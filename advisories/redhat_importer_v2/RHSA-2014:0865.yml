summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix three security issues and two bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  It was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk
  sizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming
  an unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server
  resources. (CVE-2014-0075)

  It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when
  parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located
  behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly.
  (CVE-2014-0099)

  It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet
  implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External
  Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this
  to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive
  information. (CVE-2014-0096)

  The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The patch that resolved the CVE-2014-0050 issue contained redundant code.
  This update removes the redundant code. (BZ#1094528)

  * The patch that resolved the CVE-2013-4322 issue contained an invalid
  check that triggered a java.io.EOFException while reading trailer headers
  for chunked requests. This update fixes the check and the aforementioned
  exception is no longer triggered in the described scenario. (BZ#1095602)

  All Tomcat 6 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. Tomcat must be
  restarted for this update to take effect.
