summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss rules and BPMN2-compliant business processes.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.7 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.6, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in ZooKeeper which allows an attacker to dramatically increase CPU utilization by abusing "wchp/wchc" commands, leading to the server being unable to serve legitimate requests. (CVE-2017-5637)

  * It was discovered that the XmlUtils class in jbpmmigration performed expansion of external parameter entities while parsing XML files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server and, potentially, perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2017-7545)

  Red Hat would like to thank Man Yue Mo (Semmle) for reporting CVE-2017-7545.
