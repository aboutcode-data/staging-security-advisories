summary: "Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.5.2 is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.\n\nRed\
  \ Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  Red Hat AMQ Streams, based on the Apache Kafka project, offers a distributed backbone that\
  \ allows microservices and other applications to share data with extremely high throughput\
  \ and extremely low latency. \n\nThis release of Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.5.2 serves as a replacement\
  \ for Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.5.1, and includes security and bug fixes, and enhancements.\n\n\
  Security Fix(es):\n* Scala: sbt is a build tool for Scala, Java, and others. Given a specially\
  \ crafted zip or JAR file, `IO.unzip` allows writing of arbitrary file. This would have potential\
  \ to overwrite `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Within sbt's main code, `IO.unzip` is used in\
  \ `pullRemoteCache` task and `Resolvers.remote`; however many projects use `IO.unzip(...)`\
  \ directly to implement custom tasks. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.9.7.(CVE-2023-46122)\n\
  \n* ZooKeeper: Information disclosure in persistent watcher handling. Users are recommended\
  \ to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.\n(CVE-2024-23944)\n\n* ZooKeeper:\
  \ Authorization Bypass in Apache ZooKeeper [amq-st-2](CVE-2023-44981)\n\n* Snappy: flaw was\
  \ found in SnappyInputStream in snappy-java. This issue occurs when decompressing data with\
  \ a too-large chunk size due to a missing upper bound check on chunk length. An unrecoverable\
  \ fatal error can occur, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Kafka:\
  \ snappy-java: Unchecked chunk length leads to DoS [amq-st-2](CVE-2023-34455), (CVE-2024-27309),\
  \ (CVE-2024-31141)\n\n* Strimzi Operators: vertx-core: io.vertx:vertx-core: memory leak when\
  \ a TCP server is configured with TLS and SNI support (CVE-2024-1300)\n\n* Strimzi Bridge:\
  \ flaw was found in SnappyInputStream in snappy-java (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Strimzi Bridge:\
  \ netty-codec-http: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CVE-2024-29025)\n\
  \n* Strimzi Bridge: vertx-core: io.vertx:vertx-core: memory leak when a TCP server is configured\
  \ with TLS and SNI support (CVE-2024-1300)\n\n* Strimzi Bridge: netty-codec-http2: HTTP/2:\
  \ Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (CVE-2023-44487)\n \n\
  * Strimzi Bridge: Bump snappy-java to fix (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Strimzi OAuth: In Connect2id\
  \ Nimbus JOSE+JWT before 9.37.2, an attacker can cause a denial of service (resource consumption)\
  \ via a large JWE p2c header value (aka iteration count) for the PasswordBasedDecrypter (PBKDF2)\
  \ component. (CVE-2023-52428)\n\n* Cruise Control: flaw was found in SnappyInputStream in\
  \ snappy-java (CVE-2023-43642)\n\n* Cruise Control: jose4j- denial of service via specially\
  \ crafted JWE (CVE-2023-51775)\n \n* Cruise Control: Bump snappy-java to fix (CVE-2023-43642)\n\
  \n* Cruise Control: cruise-control reported a high-sev json vulnerability (CVE-2023-5072)\n\
  \n* Cruise Control: Nimbus JOSE+JWT before 9.37.2 (CVE-2023-52428)\n\n* Strimzi Kafka Kubernetes\
  \ Config Provider: Bump snappy-java to fix (CVE-2023-43642)"
