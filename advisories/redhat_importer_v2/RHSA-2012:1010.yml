  - CVE-2012-1154
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  mod_cluster is an Apache HTTP Server (httpd) based load balancer that
  forwards requests from httpd to application server nodes. It can use the
  AJP, HTTP, or HTTPS protocols for communication with application server
  nodes.

  The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 release (RHSA-2011:1805)
  introduced a regression, causing mod_cluster to register and expose the
  root context of a server by default, even when "ROOT" was in the
  "excludedContexts" list in the mod_cluster configuration. If an application
  was deployed on the root context, a remote attacker could use this flaw to
  bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to that application.
  (CVE-2012-1154)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
