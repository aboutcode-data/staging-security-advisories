  - CVE-2015-5165
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  An information leak flaw was found in the way QEMU's RTL8139 emulation
  implementation processed network packets under RTL8139 controller's C+ mode
  of operation. An unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to read up to
  65 KB of uninitialized QEMU heap memory. (CVE-2015-5165)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Donghai Zhu of Alibaba as the original reporter.

  All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
