  - CVE-2013-4480
summary: |
  Updated spacewalk-java packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Satellite 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Satellite is a systems management tool for Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and remote management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool. The spacewalk-java packages contain the code for the Java version of the Spacewalk Web site.

  It was found that the web interface provided by Red Hat Satellite to create the initial administrator user was not disabled after the initial user was created. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create an administrator user with credentials they specify. This user could then be used to assume control of the Satellite server. (CVE-2013-4480)

  This issue was discovered by Andrew Spurrier of Red Hat.

  All spacewalk-java users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
