summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language\
  \ commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nA response-splitting issue was discovered\
  \ in the PHP session handling.  If\na remote attacker can force a carefully crafted session\
  \ identifier to be\nused, a cross-site-scripting or response-splitting attack could be\npossible.\
  \  (CVE-2006-3016)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the PHP sscanf() function.  If a\
  \ script\nused the sscanf() function with positional arguments in the format string,\na remote\
  \ attacker sending a carefully crafted request could execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache'\
  \ user.  (CVE-2006-4020)\n\nAn integer overflow was discovered in the PHP wordwrap() and str_repeat()\n\
  functions.  If a script running on a 64-bit server used either of these\nfunctions on untrusted\
  \ user data, a remote attacker sending a carefully\ncrafted request might be able to cause\
  \ a heap overflow.  (CVE-2006-4482)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the PHP gd extension.\
  \  If a script was\nset up to process GIF images from untrusted sources using the gd extension,\n\
  a remote attacker could cause a heap overflow.  (CVE-2006-4484)\n\nAn integer overflow was\
  \ discovered in the PHP memory allocation handling. \nOn 64-bit platforms, the \"memory_limit\"\
  \ setting was not enforced correctly,\nwhich could allow a denial of service attack by a remote\
  \ user.  (CVE-2006-4486)\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\n\
  backported patches to correct these issues.  These packages also contain a\nfix for a bug\
  \ where certain input strings to the metaphone() function could\ncause memory corruption."
