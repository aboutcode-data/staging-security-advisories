  - CVE-2003-0853
  - CVE-2003-0854
summary: "Updated fileutils and coreutils packages that close a potential denial of\nservice\
  \ vulnerability are now available.\n\nThe fileutils package contains several basic system\
  \ utilities. One of\nthese utilities is the \"ls\" program, which is used to list information\n\
  about files and directories. In Red Hat Linux 9, the ls program is part of\nthe coreutils\
  \ package.\n\nGeorgi Guninski discovered a memory starvation denial of service\nvulnerability\
  \ in the ls program.  It is possible to make ls allocate a\nhuge amount of memory by specifying\
  \ certain command line arguments.  This\nvulnerability is remotely exploitable through services\
  \ like wu-ftpd, which\npass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n\
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0854 to this issue.\n\nA non-exploitable\
  \ integer overflow in ls has also been discovered.  It is\npossible to make ls crash by specifying\
  \ certain command line arguments. \nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable through services\
  \ like wu-ftpd,\nwhich pass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n\
  project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0853 to this issue.\n\nThis erratum\
  \ contains new fileutils packages for Red Hat Linux versions\n7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.  It\
  \ also contains new coreutils packages for Red\nHat Linux 9.  These packages contain backported\
  \ patches correcting these\nvulnerabilities.\n\nThe Red Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3 packages also\
  \ add support for the\nO_DIRECT flag, which controls the use of synchronous I/O on file systems\n\
  such as OCFS."
