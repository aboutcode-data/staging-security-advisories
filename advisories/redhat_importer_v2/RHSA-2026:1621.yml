  - CVE-2025-67268
summary: |
  An update for gpsd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.0 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  gpsd is a service daemon that mediates access to a GPS sensor connected to the host computer by serial or USB interface, making its data on the location/course/velocity of the sensor available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host computer.  With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications (such as navigational and war-driving software) can share access to a GPS without contention or loss of data.  Also, gpsd responds to queries with a format that is substantially easier to parse than NMEA 0183.

  Security Fix(es):

  * gpsd: gpsd: Arbitrary code execution via heap-based out-of-bounds write in NMEA2000 packet handling (CVE-2025-67268)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
