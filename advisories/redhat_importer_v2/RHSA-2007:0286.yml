  - CVE-2006-1057
summary: |
  An updated gdm package that fixes a security issue and a bug is now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  Gdm (the GNOME Display Manager) is a highly configurable reimplementation
  of xdm, the X Display Manager. Gdm allows you to log into your system with
  the X Window System running and supports running several different X
  sessions on your local machine at the same time.

  Marcus Meissner discovered a race condition issue in the way Gdm modifies
  the permissions on the .ICEauthority file. A local attacker could exploit
  this flaw to gain privileges. Due to the nature of the flaw, however, a
  successful exploitation was unlikely. (CVE-2006-1057)

  This erratum also includes a bug fix to correct the pam configuration for
  the audit system.

  All users of gdm should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
