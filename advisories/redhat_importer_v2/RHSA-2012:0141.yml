  - CVE-2011-3026
summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, e-mail and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images. A web page containing a malicious
  PNG image could cause SeaMonkey to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2011-3026)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  this issue. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
