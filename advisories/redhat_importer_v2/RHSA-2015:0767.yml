aliases:
  - CVE-2014-8962
  - CVE-2014-9028
summary: |
  Updated flac packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The flac packages contain a decoder and an encoder for the FLAC (Free
  Lossless Audio Codec) audio file format.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way flac decoded FLAC audio files.
  An attacker could create a specially crafted FLAC audio file that could
  cause an application using the flac library to crash or execute arbitrary
  code when the file was read. (CVE-2014-9028)

  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way flac processed certain ID3v2
  metadata. An attacker could create a specially crafted FLAC audio file that
  could cause an application using the flac library to crash when the file
  was read. (CVE-2014-8962)

  All flac users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  update, all applications linked against the flac library must be restarted
  for this update to take effect.
