  - CVE-2007-4619
  - CVE-2007-6277
summary: |
  An updated flac package to correct a security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  FLAC is a Free Lossless Audio Codec.  The flac package consists of a FLAC
  encoder and decoder in library form, a program to encode and decode FLAC
  files, a metadata editor for FLAC files and input plugins for various music
  players.

  A security flaw was found in the way flac processed audio data. An
  attacker could create a carefully crafted FLAC audio file in such a way that
  it could cause an application linked with flac libraries to crash or execute
  arbitrary code when it was opened. (CVE-2007-4619)

  Users of flac are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch that resolves this issue.
