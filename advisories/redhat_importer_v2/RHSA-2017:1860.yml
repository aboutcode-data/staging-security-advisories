  - CVE-2015-3622
summary: |
  An update for libtasn1 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Libtasn1 is a library that provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1, as specified by the X.680 ITU-T recommendation) parsing and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER, as per X.690) encoding and decoding functions.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: libtasn1 (4.10). (BZ#1360639)

  Security Fix(es):

  * A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libtasn1 library decoded certain DER-encoded inputs. A specially crafted DER-encoded input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform an invalid read, causing the application to crash. (CVE-2015-3622)

  * A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtasn1 decoded certain DER encoded data. An attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using the libtasn1 library. (CVE-2015-2806)

  Additional Changes:
