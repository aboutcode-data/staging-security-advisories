summary: |
  Updated spacewalk-java, spacewalk-web, and satellite-branding packages that
  fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Satellite is a systems management tool for Linux-based
  infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, remote management and
  monitoring of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the Red Hat
  Satellite web interface performed sanitization of notes for registered
  systems. A remote authenticated Red Hat Satellite user could create a
  malicious note that, when viewed by a victim, could execute arbitrary web
  script with the privileges of the user viewing that note. (CVE-2012-6149)

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the Red Hat
  Satellite web interface. A remote attacker could provide a specially
  crafted link that, when visited by an authenticated Red Hat Satellite user,
  would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's
  web interface session. (CVE-2013-1871, CVE-2013-4415)

  An HTTP header injection flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Satellite
  web interface processed the return URL parameter for all HTTP GET requests.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
  and HTTP response splitting attacks against users visiting the site.
  (CVE-2013-1869)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Ford of Puppet Labs for reporting
  CVE-2012-6149, Ryan Giobbi of UPMC for reporting CVE-2013-1869 and
  CVE-2013-1871, and Adam Willard and Jose Carlos de Arriba of Foreground
  Security for reporting CVE-2013-4415.

  Users of Red Hat Satellite 5.6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which resolve these issues. For this update to take effect, Red
  Hat Satellite must be restarted. Refer to the Solution section for details.
