summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes several security issues and
  various bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM emulated the e1000 network interface
  card when the host was configured to accept jumbo network frames, and a
  guest using the e1000 emulated driver was not. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  root privileges in the guest. (CVE-2012-6075)

  It was discovered that GnuTLS leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites were used. A
  remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from
  the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding oracle.
  (CVE-2013-1619)

  It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
  TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
  were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
  text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
  padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
  in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
  applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
  response. (CVE-2013-0166)

  It was discovered that the TLS/SSL protocol could leak information about
  plain text when optional compression was used. An attacker able to control
  part of the plain text sent over an encrypted TLS/SSL connection could
  possibly use this flaw to recover other portions of the plain text.
  (CVE-2012-4929)

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2013-0292 (dbus-glib issue)

  CVE-2013-0228, CVE-2013-0268, and CVE-2013-0871 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2013-0338 (libxml2 issue)
