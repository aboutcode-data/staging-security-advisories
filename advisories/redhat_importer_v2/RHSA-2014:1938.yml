  - CVE-2014-7821
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue and one bug
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
  system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
  function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
  as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way neutron handled the
  'dns_nameservers' parameter. By providing specially crafted
  'dns_nameservers' values, an authenticated user could use this flaw to
  crash the neutron service. (CVE-2014-7821)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill, and Michael Xin
  (Rackspace) as the original reporters.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The "/var/log/neutron/" directory was world-readable. With this update,
  world-read permissions have been removed. (BZ#1149688)

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
