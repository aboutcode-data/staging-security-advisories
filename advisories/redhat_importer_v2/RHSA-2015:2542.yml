summary: |
  Updated jboss-ec2-eap packages that fix two security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.4.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code
  execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed
  chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the
  commons-collections library. (CVE-2015-7501)

  Further information about the commons-collections flaw may be found at:
  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023

  It was found that JBoss EAP did not properly authorize a user performing a
  shut down. A remote user with the Monitor, Deployer, or Auditor role could
  use this flaw to shut down the EAP server, which is an action restricted to
  admin users. (CVE-2015-5304)

  The CVE-2015-5304 issue was discovered by Ladislav Thon of Red Hat
  Middleware Quality Engineering.

  The jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic
  Compute Cloud (EC2). With this update, the packages have been updated to
  ensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.4.5. Documentation for these changes is available from the link in the
  References section.

  All jboss-ec2-eap users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
