summary: "Updated tcpdump, libpcap, and arpwatch packages are available, fixing\na number of\
  \ vulnerabilities that could be used to cause a denial of service\nattack, or possibly execute\
  \ arbitrary code.\n\ntcpdump is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic. \n\nThe\
  \ BGP decoding routines in tcpdump before 3.6.2 used incorrect bounds\nchecking when copying\
  \ data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service and possibly execute arbitrary\
  \ code (as the 'pcap' user).\n\nThe RADIUS decoder in tcpdump 3.6.2 and earlier allows remote\
  \ attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid RADIUS packet with a\nheader\
  \ length field of 0.  This causes tcpdump to generate data within an\ninfinite loop.\n\nA\
  \ vulnerability in tcpdump before 3.7.2 is related to an inability to\nhandle unknown RADIUS\
  \ attributes properly, and allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (infinite\
  \ loop).\n\nThe ISAKMP parser in tcpdump 3.6 through 3.7.1 allows remote attackers to\ncause\
  \ a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed ISAKMP\npacket to UDP port 500, causing\
  \ tcpdump to enter an infinite loop.\n\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these errata\
  \ packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these issues."
