summary: "Updated mozilla packages that fix various bugs are now available.\n\nThis update has\
  \ been rated as having critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\n\
  Mozilla is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup client,\nIRC chat client,\
  \ and HTML editor.\n\nA buffer overflow bug was found in the way Mozilla processes GIF images.\
  \ It\nis possible for an attacker to create a specially crafted GIF image, which\nwhen viewed\
  \ by a victim will execute arbitrary code as the victim. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-0399 to this issue.\n\nA bug was\
  \ found in the way Mozilla responds to proxy auth requests. It is\npossible for a malicious\
  \ webserver to steal credentials from a victims\nbrowser by issuing a 407 proxy authentication\
  \ request. (CAN-2005-0147)\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays dialog windows.\
  \ It is possible\nthat a malicious web page which is being displayed in a background tab\n\
  could present the user with a dialog window appearing to come from the\nactive page. (CAN-2004-1380)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla Mail handles cookies when loading\ncontent over HTTP\
  \ regardless of the user's preference. It is possible that\na particular user could be tracked\
  \ through the use of malicious mail\nmessages which load content over HTTP. (CAN-2005-0149)\n\
  \nA flaw was found in the way Mozilla displays international domain names. It\nis possible\
  \ for an attacker to display a valid URL, tricking the user into\nthinking they are viewing\
  \ a legitimate webpage when they are not.\n(CAN-2005-0233)\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla\
  \ handles pop-up windows. It is possible\nfor a malicious website to control the content in\
  \ an unrelated site's\npop-up window. (CAN-2004-1156)\n\nA bug was found in the way Mozilla\
  \ saves temporary files. Temporary files\nare saved with world readable permissions, which\
  \ could allow a local\nmalicious user to view potentially sensitive data. (CAN-2005-0142)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla handles synthetic middle click events. \nIt is possible\
  \ for a malicious web page to steal the contents of a victims\nclipboard. (CAN-2005-0146)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla processes XUL content.  If a malicious\nweb page can\
  \ trick a user into dragging an object, it is possible to load\nmalicious XUL content. (CAN-2005-0401)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla loads links in a new tab which are\nmiddle clicked. A\
  \ malicious web page could read local files or modify\nprivileged chrom settings. (CAN-2005-0141)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Mozilla displays the secure site icon. A\nmalicious web page\
  \ can use a view-source URL targetted at a secure page,\nwhile loading an insecure page, yet\
  \ the secure site icon shows the previous\nsecure state. (CAN-2005-0144)\n\nA bug was found\
  \ in the way Mozilla displays the secure site icon. A\nmalicious web page can display the\
  \ secure site icon by loading a binary\nfile from a secured site. (CAN-2005-0143)\n\nA bug\
  \ was found in the way Mozilla displays the download dialog window. A\nmalicious site can\
  \ obfuscate the content displayed in the source field,\ntricking a user into thinking they\
  \ are downloading content from a trusted\nsource. (CAN-2005-0585)\n\nUsers of Mozilla are\
  \ advised to upgrade to this updated package which\ncontains Mozilla version 1.7.6 to correct\
  \ these issues."
