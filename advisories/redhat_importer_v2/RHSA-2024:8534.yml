summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform provides an enterprise framework for building, deploying and managing IT automation at scale. IT Managers can provide top-down guidelines on how automation is applied to individual teams, while automation developers retain the freedom to write tasks that leverage existing knowledge without the overhead. Ansible Automation Platform makes it possible for users across an organization to share, vet, and manage automation content by means of a simple, powerful, and agentless language.

  Security Fix(es):

  * automation-controller: Django: Memory exhaustion in django.utils.numberformat.floatformat() (CVE-2024-41989)
  * automation-controller: Django: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in django.utils.html.urlize() (CVE-2024-45230)
  * automation-gateway: XSS on automation-gateway (CVE-2024-10033)
  * receptor: quic-go: memory exhaustion attack against QUIC's connection ID mechanism (CVE-2024-22189)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Updates and fixes included:

  * With this update, upgrades from Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 to 2.5 are supported for RPM and Operator-based deployments for Automation controller and Automation hub. For more information on how to upgrade, refer to the Upgrading section of the AAP landing page. (ANSTRAT-809)

  Container-based Ansible Automation Platform
  * The TLS Certificate Authority private key can now use a passphrase. (AAP-33594)
  * Automation hub is populated with container images (decision and execution environments) and Ansible collections. (AAP-33759)
  * The Automation controller, Event-Driven Ansible, and automation hub legacy UIs now display a redirect page to the Platform UI rather than a blank page. (AAP-33794)
  * Fixed the uninstall playbook execution when the environment was already uninstalled. (AAP-32981)
  * containerized installer setup has been updated to 2.5-3

  RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform
  * Added platform Redis to RPM-based Ansible Automation Platform. This allows a 6 node cluster for a Redis high availability (HA) deployment. (AAP-33773)
  * Removed the variable aap_caching_mtls and replaced it with redis_disable_tls and redis_disable_mtls which are boolean flags that disable Redis server TLS and Redis client certificate authentication. (AAP-33773)
  * An informative redirect page is now shown when going to automation controller, Event-Driven Ansible, or automation hub URL. (AAP-33827)
  * ansible-automation-platform-installer and installer setup have been updated to 2.5-4

  Additional changes:
  * automation-controller has been updated to 4.6.2
  * automation-eda-controller has been updated to 1.1.2
  * automation-gateway has been updated to 2.5.3
  * automation-hub/python3.11-galaxy-ng has been updated to 4.10.1
  * python3.11-django-ansible-base has been updated to 2.5.3
  * receptor has been updated to 1.4.9
