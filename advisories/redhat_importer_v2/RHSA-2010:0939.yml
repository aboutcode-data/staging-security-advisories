summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 4.3.0.CP09, which fixes three
  security issues and multiple bugs, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
  innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
  Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
  simple enterprise solution.

  This release of JBEAP serves as a replacement to JBEAP 4.3.0.CP08. It
  includes multiple bug fixes which are detailed in the Release Notes. The
  Release Notes will be available shortly from the link in the References
  section.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the way JBoss Drools implemented
  certain rule base serialization. If a remote attacker supplied
  specially-crafted input to a JBoss Seam based application that accepts
  serialized input, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the JBoss server process. (CVE-2010-3708)

  A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in the JMX Console. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to deploy a WAR file of their choosing
  on the target server, if they are able to trick a user, who is logged into
  the JMX Console as the admin user, into visiting a specially-crafted web
  page. (CVE-2010-3878)

  A flaw was found in the JBoss Remoting component. A remote attacker could
  use specially-crafted input to cause the JBoss Remoting listeners to become
  unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition for services
  communicating via JBoss Remoting sockets. (CVE-2010-3862)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ole Husgaard of eXerp.com for reporting the
  CVE-2010-3862 issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBEAP
  "server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, and any other customized
  configuration files.

  All users of JBEAP 4.3.0.CP08 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal
  are advised to upgrade to JBEAP 4.3.0.CP09. Refer to the Solution section
  of this erratum for installation instructions.
