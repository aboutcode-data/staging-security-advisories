  - CVE-2013-1591
summary: |
  Updated pixman packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Pixman is a pixel manipulation library for the X Window System and Cairo.

  An integer overflow flaw was discovered in one of pixman's manipulation
  routines. If a remote attacker could trick an application using pixman into
  performing a certain manipulation, it could cause the application to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2013-1591)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue. All applications using
  pixman must be restarted for this update to take effect.
