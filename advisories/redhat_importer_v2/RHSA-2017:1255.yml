  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.15 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.14, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that under certain conditions RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with YamlProvider, resulting in unmarshalling of potentially untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this flaw execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy. (CVE-2016-9606)

  Red Hat would like to thank Moritz Bechler (AgNO3 GmbH & Co. KG) for reporting these issues.
