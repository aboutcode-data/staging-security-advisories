summary: |
  Updated tetex packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
  formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
  Independent (DVI) file as output.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX processed virtual font
  files when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker could create a
  malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0827)

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way teTeX processed
  special commands when converting DVI files into PostScript. An attacker
  could create a malicious DVI file that would cause the dvips executable to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0739,
  CVE-2010-1440)

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way teTeX processed DVI
  files containing HyperTeX references with long titles, when converting them
  into PostScript. An attacker could create a malicious DVI file that would
  cause the dvips executable to crash. (CVE-2007-5935)

  teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)
  file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF
  documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code:

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.
  (CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-1179)

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. If a local user
  generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a specially-crafted
  PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0791,
  CVE-2009-3609)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.
  (CVE-2009-0195)

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.
  (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-1182)

  Multiple flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the
  freeing of arbitrary memory. If a local user generated a PDF file from a
  TeX document, referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause
  Xpdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges
  of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)

  Multiple input validation flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running pdflatex.
  (CVE-2009-0800)

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in Xpdf's JBIG2 decoder. If a
  local user generated a PDF file from a TeX document, referencing a
  specially-crafted PDF file, it would cause Xpdf to crash. (CVE-2009-0799,
  CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1183)

  Red Hat would like to thank Braden Thomas and Drew Yao of the Apple Product
  Security team, Will Dormann of the CERT/CC, and Alin Rad Pop of Secunia
  Research, for responsibly reporting the Xpdf flaws.

  All users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
