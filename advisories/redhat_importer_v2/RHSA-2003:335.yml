summary: |
  Updated Net-SNMP packages are available to correct a security vulnerability
  and other bugs.

  The Net-SNMP project includes various Simple Network Management Protocol
  (SNMP) tools.

  A security issue in Net-SNMP versions before 5.0.9 could allow an existing
  user/community to gain access to data in MIB objects that were explicitly
  excluded from their view.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0935 to this issue.

  Users of Net-SNMP are advised upgrade to these errata packages containing
  Net-SNMP 5.0.9 which is not vulnerable to this issue.  In addition,
  Net-SNMP 5.0.9 fixes a number of other minor bugs.
