summary: "Updated KDE packages that resolve a local security issue with KDM PAM\nsupport and\
  \ weak session cookie generation are now available.\n\nKDE is a graphical desktop environment\
  \ for the X Window System.  \n\nKDE between versions 2.2.0 and 3.1.3 inclusive contain a bug\
  \ in the KDE\nDisplay Manager (KDM) when checking the result of a pam_setcred() call. \nIf\
  \ an error condition is triggered by the installed PAM modules, KDM might\ngrant local root\
  \ access to any user with valid login credentials.\n\nIt has been reported that one way to\
  \ trigger this bug is by having a\ncertain configuration of the MIT pam_krb5 module that leaves\
  \ a session\nalive and gives root access to a regular user.  The Common Vulnerabilities\n\
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0690\nto this issue.\n\
  \nIn addition, the session cookie generation algorithm used by KDM was\nconsidered too weak\
  \ to supply a full 128 bits of entropy.  This could make\nit possible for non-authorized users,\
  \ who are able to bypass any host\nrestrictions, to brute-force the session cookie and gain\
  \ acess to the\ncurrent session.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2003-0692 to this issue.\n\nUsers of KDE are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these erratum packages, which\ncontain security patches correcting these issues.\n\n\
  Red Hat would like to thank the KDE team for notifying us of this issue and\nproviding the\
  \ security patches."
