summary: "Updated thunderbird package that fixes various bugs is now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by\
  \ the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup\
  \ client.\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled anonymous functions during\nregular\
  \ expression string replacement. It is possible for a malicious HTML\nmail to capture a random\
  \ block of client memory. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned this\
  \ bug the name\nCAN-2005-0989.\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird validated several\
  \ XPInstall related\nJavaScript objects. A malicious HTML mail could pass other objects to\
  \ the\nXPInstall objects, resulting in the JavaScript interpreter jumping to\narbitrary locations\
  \ in memory. (CAN-2005-1159)\n\nA bug was found in the way the Thunderbird privileged UI code\
  \ handled DOM\nnodes from the content window. An HTML message could install malicious\nJavaScript\
  \ code or steal data when a user performs commonplace actions such\nas clicking a link or\
  \ opening the context menu. (CAN-2005-1160)\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird executed\
  \ JavaScript code. JavaScript\nexecuted from HTML mail should run with a restricted access\
  \ level,\npreventing dangerous actions. It is possible that a malicious HTML mail\ncould execute\
  \ JavaScript code with elevated privileges, allowing access to\nprotected data and functions.\
  \ (CAN-2005-1532)\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird executed Javascript in XBL controls.\n\
  It is possible for a malicious HTML mail to leverage this vulnerability to\nexecute other\
  \ JavaScript based attacks even when JavaScript is disabled.\n(CAN-2005-2261)\n\nA bug was\
  \ found in the way Thunderbird handled certain Javascript\nfunctions. It is possible for a\
  \ malicious HTML mail to crash the client by\nexecuting malformed Javascript code. (CAN-2005-2265)\n\
  \nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled child frames. It is possible\nfor a malicious\
  \ framed HTML mail to steal sensitive information from its\nparent frame. (CAN-2005-2266)\
  \ \n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird handled DOM node names. It is\npossible for a\
  \ malicious HTML mail to overwrite a DOM node name, allowing\ncertain privileged chrome actions\
  \ to execute the malicious JavaScript.\n(CAN-2005-2269)\n\nA bug was found in the way Thunderbird\
  \ cloned base objects. It is possible\nfor HTML content to navigate up the prototype chain\
  \ to gain access to\nprivileged chrome objects. (CAN-2005-2270) \n\nUsers of Thunderbird are\
  \ advised to upgrade to this updated package that\ncontains Thunderbird version 1.0.6 and\
  \ is not vulnerable to these issues."
