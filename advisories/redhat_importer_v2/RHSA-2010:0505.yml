  - CVE-2007-4829
summary: |
  An updated perl-Archive-Tar package that fixes multiple security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Archive::Tar module provides a mechanism for Perl scripts to manipulate
  tar archive files.

  Multiple directory traversal flaws were discovered in the Archive::Tar
  module. A specially-crafted tar file could cause a Perl script, using the
  Archive::Tar module to extract the archive, to overwrite an arbitrary file
  writable by the user running the script. (CVE-2007-4829)

  This package upgrades the Archive::Tar module to version 1.39_01. Refer to
  the Archive::Tar module's changes file, linked to in the References, for a
  full list of changes.

  Users of perl-Archive-Tar are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which corrects these issues. All applications using the Archive::Tar module
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
