summary: "Updated CUPS packages are available for Red Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0 which fix\nvarious\
  \ security issues.\n\nThe Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing\n\
  layer.  A number of vulnerabilities have been discovered in CUPS.\n\nCUPS was distributed\
  \ with Red Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0 but is not\ninstalled by default.\n\n1. An integer overflow\
  \ exists in the CUPS HTTP interface that allows\na local attacker to gain the permissions\
  \ of the 'lp' user.  (CAN-2002-1383)\n\n2. A race condition exists in the creation of a pid\
  \ file which allows\nan attacker who already has privileges of the 'lp' user (for example\
  \ from\nutilizing a different exploit) to create or overwrite any file as\nroot, leading to\
  \ arbitrary code execution.  (CAN-2002-1366)\n\n3. It is possible to remotely add a printer\
  \ to CUPS by sending a\nspecially crafted UDP packet.  If an attacker utilizes this vulnerability,\n\
  they could add a printer with a tainted name that if clicked on in the\nweb administration\
  \ interface could be used to exploit other\nvulnerabilities.  (CAN-2002-1367)\n\nBy utilizing\
  \ this vulnerability, an attacker could take a number of steps\nto be able to get hold of\
  \ the certificate used to access the administrative\nsection of the CUPS server and potentially\
  \ add a printer that will execute\ncommands with root privileges.\n\n4. Problems with chunked\
  \ encoding and negative content length handling\nin the CUPS HTTP interface can cause CUPS\
  \ to crash.  On Red Hat Linux\nplatforms this can cause a denial of service (DoS) against\
  \ CUPS. \n(CAN-2002-1368)\n\n5. A number of integer overflows exist in the image handling\
  \ code of\nthe filters in CUPS.  In addition, CUPS does not properly check for\nzero width\
  \ GIF images. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker who has\nthe ability to print to run\
  \ arbitrary code as the 'lp' user.  (CAN-2002-1371)\n\n6. An integer overflow exists in the\
  \ CUPS pdftops filter.  This can be\nexploited by an attacker who is able to print sending\
  \ a carefully\ncrafted PDF file which can execute arbitrary commands as the 'lp' user.\n(CAN-2002-1384)\n\
  \n7. A buffer overflow exists in setting up the job management options.\nWhen combined with\
  \ other vulnerabilities, this could allow a local user\nto gain root privileges.  This issue\
  \ only affects the version of CUPS\nshipped with Red Hat Linux 7.3.  (CAN-2002-1369)\n\n8.\
  \ A bug in the select() call would allow an easy DoS attack which would\ncause CUPS to not\
  \ recover once the DoS has stopped. (CAN-2002-1372)\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0 were shipped\
  \ with versions of CUPS that are\nvulnerable to these issues. All users of CUPS are advised\
  \ to upgrade to the\nerratum packages which contain a patch to correct these issue."
