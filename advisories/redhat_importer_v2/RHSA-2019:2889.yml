  - CVE-2019-14835
summary: "An update for redhat-release-virtualization-host and redhat-virtualization-host is\
  \ now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for\
  \ each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nThe redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are\
  \ installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required\
  \ to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's\
  \ resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe following packages have been upgraded\
  \ to a later upstream version: redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.3.5), redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ (4.3.5). (BZ#1751436, BZ#1754063)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw was found\
  \ in the way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs,\
  \ logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors\
  \ with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase\
  \ their privileges on the host. (CVE-2019-14835)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s),\
  \ including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s)\
  \ listed in the References section."
