  - CVE-2008-3529
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The libxml2 packages provide a library that allows you to manipulate XML
  files. It includes support to read, modify, and write XML and HTML files.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 handled long
  XML entity names. If an application linked against libxml2 processed
  untrusted malformed XML content, it could cause the application to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3529)

  All users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
