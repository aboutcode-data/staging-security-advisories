  Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
  denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload,
  which is embedded in the JBoss Web component of JBoss Operations Network as
  well as provided as a standalone component, handled small-sized buffers
  used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create a
  malformed Content-Type header for a multipart request, causing JBoss Web or
  Apache Commons FileUpload itself to enter an infinite loop when processing
  such an incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)

  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1.
