aliases:
  - CVE-2014-3476
  - CVE-2014-3520
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0 and 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
  OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
  The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
  user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style
  logins.

  A flaw was found in keystone's chained delegation. A trustee able to create
  a delegation from a trust or an OAuth token could misuse identity
  impersonation to bypass the enforced scope, possibly allowing them to
  obtain elevated privileges to the trustor's projects and roles.
  (CVE-2014-3476)

  A flaw was found in the way keystone handled trusts. A trustee could use an
  out-of-scope project ID to gain unauthorized access to a project if the
  trustor had the required roles for that requested project. (CVE-2014-3520)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
  CVE-2014-3520; upstream acknowledges Jamie Lennox of Red Hat as the
  original reporter. The CVE-2014-3476 issue was discovered by Steven Hardy
  of Red Hat.

  All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
