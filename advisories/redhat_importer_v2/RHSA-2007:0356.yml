summary: "Updated libpng packages that fix security issues are now available for Red\nHat Enterprise\
  \ Linux.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat\
  \ Security Response Team.\n\nThe libpng package contains a library of functions for creating\
  \ and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.\n\nA flaw was found\
  \ in the handling of malformed images in libpng. An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted\
  \ PNG image file in such a way that it could\ncause an application linked with libpng to crash\
  \ when the file was\nmanipulated.  (CVE-2007-2445)\n\nA flaw was found in the sPLT chunk handling\
  \ code in libpng. An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted PNG image file in such a way\
  \ that it could\ncause an application linked with libpng to crash when the file was opened.\
  \ \n(CVE-2006-5793)\n\nUsers of libpng should update to these updated packages which contain\n\
  backported patches to correct these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Glenn Randers-Pehrson,\
  \ Mats Palmgren, and Tavis\nOrmandy for supplying details and patches for these issues."
