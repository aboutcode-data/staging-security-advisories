  - CVE-2005-1739
summary: |
  Updated ImageMagick packages that fix a denial of service issue are now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  ImageMagick(TM) is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
  System that can read and write multiple image formats.

  A denial of service bug was found in the way ImageMagick parses XWD files.
  A user or program executing ImageMagick to process a malicious XWD file can
  cause ImageMagick to enter an infinite loop causing a denial of service
  condition. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2005-1739 to this issue.

  Users of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch, and are not vulnerable to this issue.
