  - CVE-2011-3919
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from
  the CVE link in the References section.

  The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation
  of various XML standards.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
  entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
  against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2011-3919)

  All users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The desktop must
  be restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
