  - CVE-2014-7144
summary: |
  Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command line utility for
  interacting with the OpenStack Identity API. The OpenStack Identity
  auth_token middleware component handles the authentication of tokens
  with keystone.

  It was found that python-keystoneclient treated all settings in paste.ini
  files as string types. If the "insecure" option were set to any value in a
  paste.ini configuration file, it would be evaluated as true, resulting in
  TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
  (CVE-2014-7144)

  Note that when the "insecure" option was not set in paste.ini, it evaluated
  to false, and verification was performed.

  All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, all
  OpenStack services using auth_token must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
