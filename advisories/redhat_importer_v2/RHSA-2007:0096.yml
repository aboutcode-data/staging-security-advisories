  - CVE-2007-0774
summary: |
  Updated mod_jk packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Application Stack v1.1.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  mod_jk is a Tomcat connector that can be used to communicate between Tomcat
  and the Apache HTTP Server 2. mod_jk was first distributed with Red Hat
  Application Stack version 1.1 released on 19 February 2007.

  A stack overflow flaw was found in the URI handler of mod_jk. A remote
  attacker could visit a carefully crafted URL being handled by mod_jk and
  trigger this flaw, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code as the
  'apache' user. (CVE-2007-0774)

  Users of mod_jk should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.

  Red Hat would like to thank TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative for
  reporting this issue.
