summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.1, which fixes one security issue and
  various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.1 serves as a
  replacement to JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.0. It includes various
  bug fixes which are detailed in the Release Notes. The Release Notes will
  be available shortly from the link in the References section.

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss
  Expression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing
  arbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to
  certain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly
  configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of
  this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)

  If you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy of
  the JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the
  updated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.

  Red Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting
  CVE-2011-1484.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.1.1.
