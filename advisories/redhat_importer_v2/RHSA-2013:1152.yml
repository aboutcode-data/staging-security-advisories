  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 that
  fixes two security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  A flaw was discovered in the way authenticated connections were cached on
  the server by remote-naming. After a user has successfully logged in, a
  remote attacker could use a remoting client to log in as that user without
  knowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform actions
  with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-4128)

  A flaw was discovered in the way connections for remote EJB invocations via
  the EJB client API were cached on the server. After a user has successfully
  logged in, a remote attacker could use an EJB client to log in as that user
  without knowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform
  actions with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-4213)

  These issues were discovered by Wolf-Dieter Fink of the Red Hat GSS Team.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
