summary: "An update for imgbased, redhat-release-virtualization-host and redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages\
  \ include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization\
  \ Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the\
  \ packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring\
  \ the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages\
  \ provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host,\
  \ ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using\
  \ a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual\
  \ machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and\
  \ performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later\
  \ upstream version: redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.4.4), redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ (4.4.4)\n\nChanges to the imgbased component:\n\n* Previously, the chronyd symlink was removed\
  \ during the upgrade process. As a result, the chronyd service was disabled following the\
  \ upgrade.\nIn this release, the chronyd service is enabled after upgrade. (BZ#1903777)\n\n\
  Security Fix(es):\n\n* lldp/openvswitch: denial of service via externally triggered memory\
  \ leak (CVE-2020-27827)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact,\
