summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
  programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
  standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot
  function properly.

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way the glibc library read timezone files. If a
  carefully-crafted timezone file was loaded by an application linked against
  glibc, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2009-5029)

  A flaw was found in the way the ldd utility identified dynamically linked
  libraries. If an attacker could trick a user into running ldd on a
  malicious binary, it could result in arbitrary code execution with the
  privileges of the user running ldd. (CVE-2009-5064)

  It was discovered that the glibc addmntent() function, used by various
  mount helper utilities, did not sanitize its input properly. A local
  attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject malformed lines into the
  mtab (mounted file systems table) file via certain setuid mount helpers, if
  the attacker were allowed to mount to an arbitrary directory under their
  control. (CVE-2010-0296)

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the way the glibc library loaded ELF (Executable and Linking
  Format) files. If a carefully-crafted ELF file was loaded by an
  application linked against glibc, it could cause the application to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2010-0830)

  It was discovered that the glibc fnmatch() function did not properly
  restrict the use of alloca(). If the function was called on sufficiently
  large inputs, it could cause an application using fnmatch() to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
  (CVE-2011-1071)

  It was found that the glibc addmntent() function, used by various mount
  helper utilities, did not handle certain errors correctly when updating the
  mtab (mounted file systems table) file. If such utilities had the setuid
  bit set, a local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file.
  (CVE-2011-1089)

  It was discovered that the locale command did not produce properly escaped
  output as required by the POSIX specification. If an attacker were able to
  set the locale environment variables in the environment of a script that
  performed shell evaluation on the output of the locale command, and that
  script were run with different privileges than the attacker's, it could
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the script. (CVE-2011-1095)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the glibc fnmatch() function. If an
  attacker supplied a long UTF-8 string to an application linked against
  glibc, it could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2011-1659)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the remote procedure call (RPC)
  implementation in glibc. A remote attacker able to open a large number of
  connections to an RPC service that is using the RPC implementation from
  glibc, could use this flaw to make that service use an excessive amount of
  CPU time. (CVE-2011-4609)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ubuntu Security Team for reporting
  CVE-2010-0830, and Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-1089. The Ubuntu
  Security Team acknowledges Dan Rosenberg as the original reporter of
  CVE-2010-0830.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * When using an nscd package that is a different version than the glibc
  package, the nscd service could fail to start. This update makes the nscd
  package require a specific glibc version to prevent this problem.
  (BZ#657009)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues.
