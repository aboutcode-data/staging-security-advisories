summary: |
  Updated openldap packages are available which fix a number of local and
  remote buffer overflows in libldap and the slapd and slurpd servers, and
  potential issues stemming from using user-specified LDAP configuration files.

  OpenLDAP is a suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
  applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of protocols for
  accessing directory services. In an audit of OpenLDAP by SuSE, a number of
  potential security issues were found:

  When reading configuration files, libldap would read the current user's
  .ldaprc file even in applications being run with elevated privileges.

  Slurpd would overflow an internal buffer if the command-line argument used
  with the -t or -r flags was too long, or if the name of a file for which it
  attempted to create an advisory lock was too long.

  When parsing filters, the getfilter family of functions from libldap could
  be made to overflow an internal buffer by supplying a carefully crafted
  ldapfilter.conf file.

  When processing LDAP entry display templates, libldap could be made to
  overflow an internal buffer by supplying a properly crafted
  ldaptemplates.conf file.

  When parsing an access control list, slapd could be made to overflow an
  internal buffer.

  When constructing the name of the file used for logging rejected
  replication requests, slapd would overflow an internal buffer if the size
  of the generated name was too large, and could be tricked into destroying
  the contents of any file owned by the ldap user due to a race condition in
  the subsequent creation of the log file.

  Red Hat Linux users who use LDAP are advised to install the updated
  openldap packages which are not vulnerable to these issues.
