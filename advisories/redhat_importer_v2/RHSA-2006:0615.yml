  - CVE-2006-3746
summary: |
  Updated GnuPG packages that fix a security issue is now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in GnuPG. An attacker could create a
  carefully crafted message packet with a large length that could cause GnuPG
  to crash or possibly overwrite memory when opened. (CVE-2006-3746)

  All users of GnuPG are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
