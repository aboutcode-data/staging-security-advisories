  - CVE-2012-2328
summary: |
  Updated sblim-cim-client2 packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The SBLIM (Standards-Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability) CIM
  (Common Information Model) Client is a class library for Java applications
  that provides access to CIM servers using the CIM Operations over HTTP
  protocol defined by the DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) standards.

  It was found that the Java HashMap implementation was susceptible to
  predictable hash collisions. SBLIM uses HashMap when parsing XML inputs. A
  specially-crafted CIM-XML message from a WBEM (Web-Based Enterprise
  Management) server could cause a SBLIM client to use an excessive amount of
  CPU. Randomization has been added to help avoid collisions. (CVE-2012-2328)

  All users of sblim-cim-client2 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
