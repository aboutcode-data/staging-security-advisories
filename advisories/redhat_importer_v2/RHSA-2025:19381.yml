summary: |
  Assisted installer RHEL 8 components for the multicluster engine for Kubernetes 2.9.1 General Availability release, with updates to container images.

  Assisted Installer RHEL 8 integrates components for the general multicluster engine
  for Kubernetes 2.9.1 release that simplify the process of deploying OpenShift Container
  Platform clusters.

  The multicluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components
  that are necessary for the centralized management of multiple
  Kubernetes-based clusters across data centers, public clouds, and private
  clouds.

  You can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
  clusters, or to import existing Kubernetes-based clusters for management.

  After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that
  are provided by the engine to distribute configuration based on placement
  policy.
