  - CVE-2002-0659
summary: "Updated OpenSSL packages are available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1, 7.2,\nand 7.3.\
  \ These updates fix multiple protocol parsing bugs which may be used\nin a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) attack or cause SSL-enabled applications to crash.\n\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade,\
  \ full-featured, and open source toolkit which\nimplements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\
  \ and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose\n\
  cryptography library.\n\nPortions of the SSL protocol data stream, which include the lengths\
  \ of\nstructures which are being transferred, may not be properly validated. This\nmay allow\
  \ a malicious server or client to cause an affected application to\ncrash or enter an infinite\
  \ loop, which can be used as a denial of service\n(DoS) attack if the application is a server.\
  \ It has not been verified if\nthis issue could lead to further consequences such as remote\
  \ code execution.\n\nThese errata packages contain a patch to correct this vulnerability.\
  \ \nPlease note that the original patch from the OpenSSL team had a mistake in\nit which could\
  \ possibly still allow buffer overflows to occur.  This bug is\nalso fixed in these errata\
  \ packages.\n\nNOTE:\n\nPlease read the Solution section below as it contains instructions\
  \ for\nmaking sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted after the update\nis applied.\n\
  \nThanks go to the OpenSSL team for providing patches for this issue."
