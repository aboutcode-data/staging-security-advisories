summary: |
  An update for poppler and evince is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Poppler is a Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering library, used by applications such as Evince.

  The evince packages provide a simple multi-page document viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF), PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files, and, with additional back-ends, also the Device Independent File format (DVI) files.

  Security Fix(es):

  * poppler: integer overflow in Parser::makeStream in Parser.cc (CVE-2018-21009)

  * poppler: heap-based buffer over-read in function PSOutputDev::checkPageSlice in PSOutputDev.cc (CVE-2019-10871)

  * poppler: heap-based buffer over-read in JPXStream::init in JPEG2000Stream.cc (CVE-2019-12293)

  * poppler: integer overflow in JPXStream::init function leading to memory consumption (CVE-2019-9959)

  * evince: uninitialized memory use in function tiff_document_render() and tiff_document_get_thumbnail() (CVE-2019-11459)
