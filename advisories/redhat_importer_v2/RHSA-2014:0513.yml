  - CVE-2013-2877
  - CVE-2014-0191
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation
  of various XML standards.

  It was discovered that libxml2 loaded external parameter entities even when
  entity substitution was disabled. A remote attacker able to provide a
  specially crafted XML file to an application linked against libxml2 could
  use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, possibly
  resulting in a denial of service or an information leak on the system.
  (CVE-2014-0191)

  An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way libxml2 detected the end of
  an XML file. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML file
  that, when processed by an application linked against libxml2, could cause
  the application to crash. (CVE-2013-2877)

  The CVE-2014-0191 issue was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange of Red Hat.

  All libxml2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The desktop must be
  restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
