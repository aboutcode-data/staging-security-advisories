summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
  is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
  Player web browser plug-in.

  This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
  vulnerabilities are detailed on the Adobe security page APSB11-26, listed
  in the References section.

  Multiple security flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed
  certain SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
  specially-crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page
  containing the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2011-2426,
  CVE-2011-2427, CVE-2011-2428, CVE-2011-2430)

  A flaw in flash-plugin could allow an attacker to conduct cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks if a victim were tricked into visiting a
  specially-crafted web page. (CVE-2011-2444)

  This update also fixes an information disclosure flaw in flash-plugin.
  (CVE-2011-2429)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
  upgrades Flash Player to version 10.3.183.10.
