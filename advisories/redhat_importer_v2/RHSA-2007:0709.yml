summary: |
  New Wireshark packages that fix various security vulnerabilities and
  functionality bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.
  Wireshark was previously known as Ethereal.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic.

  Several denial of service bugs were found in Wireshark's HTTP, iSeries, DCP
  ETSI, SSL, MMS, DHCP and BOOTP protocol dissectors. It was possible for
  Wireshark to crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off the
  network. (CVE-2007-3389, CVE-2007-3390, CVE-2007-3391, CVE-2007-3392,
  CVE-2007-3393)

  Wireshark would interpret certain completion codes incorrectly when
  dissecting IPMI traffic. Additionally, IPMI 2.0 packets would be reported
  as malformed IPMI traffic.

  Users of Wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages containing
  Wireshark version 0.99.6, which correct these issues.
