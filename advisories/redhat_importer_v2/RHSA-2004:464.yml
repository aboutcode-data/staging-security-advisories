  - CVE-2004-0494
summary: |
  An updated mc package that resolves several shell escape security issues is
  now available.

  [Updated 5 January 2005]
  Packages have been updated to include the gmc and mcserv packages which were
  left out of the initial errata.

  Midnight Commander (mc) is a visual shell much like a file manager.

  Shell escape bugs have been discovered in several of the mc vfs backend
  scripts. An attacker who is able to influence a victim to open a
  specially-crafted URI using mc could execute arbitrary commands as the
  victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2004-0494 to this issue.

  Users of mc should upgrade to this updated package which contains
  backported patches and is not vulnerable to this issue.
