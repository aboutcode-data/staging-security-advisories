  - CVE-2003-0083
summary: "Updated Apache packages are available which fix a security issue by\npreventing control\
  \ characters from being written to the error log. The\nupdated packages also include a minor\
  \ bug fix for mod_proxy.\n\nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient,\
  \ and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nThe Apache Web server before 1.3.25 does not prevent\
  \ escape sequences from\nbeing written to the error and access logs.  This could allow an\
  \ attacker\nto embed arbitrary escape sequences into the log file.  A recent paper by\nHD\
  \ Moore highlighted several issues where common terminal emulator software\n(such as xterm)\
  \ can be remotely abused or exploited by displaying arbitrary\nescape sequences. \n\nIf Apache\
  \ is configured to act as a reverse proxy by specifying the backend\nserver using a numeric\
  \ IP address, the mod_proxy module will perform a\nredundant reverse DNS lookup on the IP\
  \ address, causing a delay in request\nprocessing.\n\nUsers are advised to install these updated\
  \ packages which contain: a\npatched version of Apache which prevents control characters from\
  \ being \nwritten to log files; and a patched version of mod_proxy which does not\nperform\
  \ reverse DNS lookups unless necessary."
