  - CVE-2006-5925
summary: |
  An updated elinks package that corrects a security vulnerability is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Elinks is a text mode Web browser used from the command line that supports
  rendering modern web pages.

  An arbitrary file access flaw was found in the Elinks SMB protocol handler.
  A malicious web page could have caused Elinks to read or write files with
  the permissions of the user running Elinks. (CVE-2006-5925)

  All users of Elinks are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves this issue by removing support for the SMB protocol from Elinks.

  Note: this issue did not affect the Elinks package shipped with Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3, or the Links package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 2.1.
