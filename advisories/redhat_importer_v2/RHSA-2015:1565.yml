summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
  netfilter connection tracking implementation loaded extensions. An attacker
  on a local network could potentially send a sequence of specially crafted
  packets that would initiate the loading of a large number of extensions,
  causing the targeted system in that network to crash. (CVE-2014-9715,
  Moderate)

  * A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's early
  load microcode functionality. On a system with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, a
  local, privileged user could use this flaw to increase their privileges to
  the kernel (ring0) level, bypassing intended restrictions in place.
  (CVE-2015-2666, Moderate)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation did not
  properly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could
  lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user
  able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system.
  On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping
  sockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2015-3636, Moderate)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation
  for IPv6 allowed the Hop Limit value to be set to a smaller value than the
  default one. An attacker on a local network could use this flaw to prevent
  systems on that network from sending or receiving network packets.
  (CVE-2015-2922, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Nathan Hoad for reporting the CVE-2014-9715
  issue.

  The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-229.11.1, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,
  including:

  * drbg: Add stdrng alias and increase priority
  * seqiv / eseqiv / chainiv: Move IV seeding into init function
  * ipv4: kABI fix for 0bbf87d backport
  * ipv4: Convert ipv4.ip_local_port_range to be per netns
  * libceph: tcp_nodelay support
  * ipr: Increase default adapter init stage change timeout
  * fix use-after-free bug in usb_hcd_unlink_urb()
  * libceph: fix double __remove_osd() problem
  * ext4: fix data corruption caused by unwritten and delayed extents
  * sunrpc: Add missing support for RPC_CLNT_CREATE_NO_RETRANS_TIMEOUT
  * nfs: Fixing lease renewal (Benjamin Coddington)
  * control hard lockup detection default
  * Fix print-once on enable
  * watchdog: update watchdog_thresh properly and watchdog attributes
    atomically
  * module: Call module notifier on failure after complete_formation()

  (BZ#1234470)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The megasas driver used the smp_processor_id() function within a
  preemptible context, which caused warning messages to be returned to the
  console. The function has been changed to raw_smp_processor_id() so that a
  lock is held while getting the processor ID. As a result, correct
  operations are now allowed without any console warnings being produced.
  (BZ#1235304)

  * In the NFSv4 file system, non-standard usage of the
  write_seqcount_{begin,end}() functions were used, which caused the realtime
  code to try to sleep while locks were held. As a consequence, the
  "scheduling while atomic" error messages were returned. The underlying
  source code has been modified to use the __write_seqcount_{begin,end}()
  functions that do not hold any locks, allowing correct execution of
  realtime. (BZ#1235301)

  All kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
