  - CVE-2002-0382
summary: "A security issue in XChat allows a malicious server to execute arbitrary\ncommands.\n\
  \nXChat is a popular cross-platform IRC client. \n\nVersions of XChat prior to 1.8.9 do not\
  \ filter the response from an IRC\nserver when a /dns query is executed. Because XChat resolves\
  \ hostnames by\npassing the configured resolver and hostname to a shell, an IRC server may\n\
  return a maliciously formatted response that executes arbitrary commands\nwith the privileges\
  \ of the user running XChat.\n\nAll users of XChat are advised to update to these errata packages\n\
  containing XChat version 1.8.9 which is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\n[update 14 Aug 2002]\n\
  Previous packages pushed were not signed, this update replaces the packages\nwith signed versions"
