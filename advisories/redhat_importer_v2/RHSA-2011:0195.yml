summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  A flaw was found in the way PHP converted certain floating point values
  from string representation to a number. If a PHP script evaluated an
  attacker's input in a numeric context, the PHP interpreter could cause high
  CPU usage until the script execution time limit is reached. This issue only
  affected i386 systems. (CVE-2010-4645)

  A numeric truncation error and an input validation flaw were found in the
  way the PHP utf8_decode() function decoded partial multi-byte sequences
  for some multi-byte encodings, sending them to output without them being
  escaped. An attacker could use these flaws to perform a cross-site
  scripting attack. (CVE-2009-5016, CVE-2010-3870)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the PHP
  ZipArchive::getArchiveComment function. If a script used this function to
  inspect a specially-crafted ZIP archive file, it could cause the PHP
  interpreter to crash. (CVE-2010-3709)

  All php users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
