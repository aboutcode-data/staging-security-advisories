summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues and two bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * A malicious CIFS (Common Internet File System) server could send a
  specially-crafted response to a directory read request that would result in
  a denial of service or privilege escalation on a system that has a CIFS
  share mounted. (CVE-2011-3191, Important)

  * The way fragmented IPv6 UDP datagrams over the bridge with UDP
  Fragmentation Offload (UFO) functionality on were handled could allow a
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4326, Important)

  * GRO (Generic Receive Offload) fields could be left in an inconsistent
  state. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to cause a
  denial of service. GRO is enabled by default in all network drivers that
  support it. (CVE-2011-2723, Moderate)

  * IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence number and fragment ID generation could
  allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and possibly hijack
  connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are now more
  random. (CVE-2011-3188, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) implementation could allow
  a local user in the fuse group who has access to mount a FUSE file system
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3353, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the b43 driver. If a system had an active wireless interface
  that uses the b43 driver, an attacker able to send a specially-crafted
  frame to that interface could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3359,
  Moderate)

  * A flaw in the way CIFS shares with DFS referrals at their root were
  handled could allow an attacker on the local network, who is able to deploy
  a malicious CIFS server, to create a CIFS network share that, when mounted,
  would cause the client system to crash. (CVE-2011-3363, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the m_stop() implementation could allow a local, unprivileged
  user to trigger a denial of service. (CVE-2011-3637, Moderate)

  * Flaws in ghash_update() and ghash_final() could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4081, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the key management facility could allow a local, unprivileged
  user to cause a denial of service via the keyctl utility. (CVE-2011-4110,
  Moderate)

  * A flaw in the Journaling Block Device (JBD) could allow a local attacker
  to crash the system by mounting a specially-crafted ext3 or ext4 disk.
  (CVE-2011-4132, Moderate)

  * A flaw in the way memory containing security-related data was handled in
  tpm_read() could allow a local, unprivileged user to read the results of a
  previously run TPM command. (CVE-2011-1162, Low)

  * I/O statistics from the taskstats subsystem could be read without any
  restrictions, which could allow a local, unprivileged user to gather
  confidential information, such as the length of a password used in a
  process. (CVE-2011-2494, Low)

  * Flaws in tpacket_rcv() and packet_recvmsg() could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to leak information to user-space. (CVE-2011-2898, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Darren Lavender for reporting CVE-2011-3191;
  Brent Meshier for reporting CVE-2011-2723; Dan Kaminsky for reporting
  CVE-2011-3188; Yogesh Sharma for reporting CVE-2011-3363; Nick Bowler for
  reporting CVE-2011-4081; Peter Huewe for reporting CVE-2011-1162; and
  Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting CVE-2011-2494.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, a mismatch in the build-id of the kernel-rt and the one in
  the related debuginfo package caused failures in SystemTap and perf.
  (BZ#768413)

  * IBM x3650m3 systems were not able to boot the MRG Realtime kernel because
  they require a pmcraid driver that was not available. The pmcraid driver is
  included in this update. (BZ#753992)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.
  The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
