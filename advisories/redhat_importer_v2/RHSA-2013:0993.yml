  - CVE-2013-2161
summary: |
  Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue and one bug
  are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Swift (http://swift.openstack.org) is a highly available,
  distributed, eventually consistent object/blob store.

  An XML injection flaw in OpenStack Swift could allow remote attackers
  to manipulate the contents of XML responses via specially-crafted data.
  This could be used to trigger a denial of service. (CVE-2013-2161)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alex Gaynor from Rackspace for reporting this
  issue.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * If permissions on the "/etc/swift/" directory were incorrect, services
  (such as swift-proxy-server) flooded the console and "/var/log/messages"
  with "UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION" errors, including a traceback and "Permission
  denied: '/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf'" message. This could occur when
  restarting a service or updating the packages. (BZ#967631)

  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing this update, the
  OpenStack Swift services will be restarted automatically.
