aliases:
  - CVE-2018-12121
summary: |
  An update for http-parser is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The http-parser package provides a utility for parsing HTTP messages. It parses both requests and responses. The parser is designed to be used in performance HTTP applications. It does not make any system calls or allocations, it does not buffer data, and it can be interrupted at any time. Depending on your architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data per message stream.

  Security Fix(es):

  * nodejs: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
