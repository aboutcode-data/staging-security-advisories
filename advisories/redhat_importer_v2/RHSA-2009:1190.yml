summary: "Updated nspr and nss packages that fix security issues and bugs are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Extended Update Support.\n\nThis update has been rated\
  \ as having critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nNetscape Portable\
  \ Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI\noperating system facilities.\
  \ These facilities include threads, thread\nsynchronization, normal file and network I/O,\
  \ interval timing, calendar\ntime, basic memory management (malloc and free), and shared library\
  \ linking.\n\nNetwork Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support\n\
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server\napplications. Applications\
  \ built with NSS can support SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS,\nand other security standards.\n\nThese updated\
  \ packages upgrade NSS from the previous version, 3.12.2, to a\nprerelease of version 3.12.4.\
  \ The version of NSPR has also been upgraded\nfrom 4.7.3 to 4.7.4.\n\nMoxie Marlinspike reported\
  \ a heap overflow flaw in a regular expression\nparser in the NSS library used by browsers\
  \ such as Mozilla Firefox to match\ncommon names in certificates. A malicious website could\
  \ present a\ncarefully-crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger the heap\noverflow,\
  \ leading to a crash or, possibly, arbitrary code execution with\nthe permissions of the user\
  \ running the browser. (CVE-2009-2404)\n\nNote: in order to exploit this issue without further\
  \ user interaction in\nFirefox, the carefully-crafted certificate would need to be signed\
  \ by a\nCertificate Authority trusted by Firefox, otherwise Firefox presents the\nvictim with\
  \ a warning that the certificate is untrusted. Only if the user\nthen accepts the certificate\
  \ will the overflow take place.\n\nDan Kaminsky discovered flaws in the way browsers such\
  \ as Firefox handle\nNULL characters in a certificate. If an attacker is able to get a\ncarefully-crafted\
  \ certificate signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by\nFirefox, the attacker could use\
  \ the certificate during a man-in-the-middle\nattack and potentially confuse Firefox into\
  \ accepting it by mistake.\n(CVE-2009-2408)\n\nDan Kaminsky found that browsers still accept\
  \ certificates with MD2 hash\nsignatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically\n\
  strong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a\nmalicious certificate\
  \ that would be treated as trusted by a browser. NSS\nnow disables the use of MD2 and MD4\
  \ algorithms inside signatures by\ndefault. (CVE-2009-2409)\n\nThese version upgrades also\
  \ provide fixes for the following bugs:\n\n* SSL client authentication failed against an Apache\
  \ server when it was \nusing the mod_nss module and configured for NSSOCSP. On the client\
  \ side,\nthe user agent received an error message that referenced \"Error Code:\n-12271\"\
  \ and stated that establishing an encrypted connection had failed\nbecause the certificate\
  \ had been rejected by the host.\n\nOn the server side, the nss_error_log under /var/log/httpd/\
  \ contained the\nfollowing message:\n\n[error] Re-negotiation handshake failed: Not accepted\
  \ by client!?\n\nAlso, /var/log/httpd/error_log contained this error:\n\nSSL Library Error:\
  \ -8071 The OCSP server experienced an internal error\n\nWith these updated packages, the\
  \ dependency problem which caused this\nfailure has been resolved so that SSL client authentication\
  \ with an\nApache web server using mod_nss which is configured for NSSOCSP succeeds\nas expected.\
  \ Note that if the presented client certificate is expired,\nthen access is denied, the user\
  \ agent is presented with an error message\nabout the invalid certificate, and the OCSP queries\
  \ are seen in the OCSP\nresponder. Also, similar OCSP status verification happens for SSL\
  \ server\ncertificates used in Apache upon instance start or restart. (BZ#508026)\n\n* NSS\
  \ uses a software integrity test to detect code corruption. RPM\ntransactions and system link\
  \ optimization daemons (such as prelink) can\nchange the contents of libraries, causing the\
  \ software integrity test to\nfail. In combination with the updated prelink package (RHBA-2009:1041),\n\
  these updated packages can now prevent software integrity test failures.\n(BZ#495938)\n\n\
  All users of nspr and nss are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich resolve\
  \ these issues."
