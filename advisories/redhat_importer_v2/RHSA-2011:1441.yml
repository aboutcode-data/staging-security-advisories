summary: |
  Updated icedtea-web packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an
  implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It
  also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the
  plug-in and Web Start implementations.

  A flaw was found in the same-origin policy implementation in the
  IcedTea-Web browser plug-in. A malicious Java applet could use this flaw to
  open network connections to hosts other than the originating host,
  violating the same-origin policy. (CVE-2011-3377)

  All IcedTea-Web users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  upgrade IcedTea-Web to version 1.0.6 to correct this issue. Web browsers
  using the IcedTea-Web browser plug-in must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
