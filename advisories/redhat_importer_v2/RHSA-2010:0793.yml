  - CVE-2010-3856
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
  programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
  standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot
  function properly.

  It was discovered that the glibc dynamic linker/loader did not perform
  sufficient safety checks when loading dynamic shared objects (DSOs) to
  provide callbacks for its auditing API during the execution of
  privileged programs. A local attacker could use this flaw to escalate
  their privileges via a carefully-chosen system DSO library containing
  unsafe constructors. (CVE-2010-3856)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hawkes and Tavis Ormandy for reporting this
  issue.

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
