  - CVE-2011-1484
summary: |
  Updated jboss-seam2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The JBoss Seam 2 framework is an application framework for building web
  applications in Java.

  It was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss
  Expression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing
  arbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to
  certain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly
  configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of
  this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)

  Red Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting
  this issue.

  Users of jboss-seam2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. The JBoss server process must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
