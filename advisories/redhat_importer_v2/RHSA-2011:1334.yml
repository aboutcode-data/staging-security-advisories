  - CVE-2011-2894
summary: |
  Updated Spring Framework 3 files for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.1.0
  that fix multiple security issues are now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way Spring Framework 3 deserialized
  certain Java objects. If an attacker were able to control the stream from
  which an application with the Spring Framework 3 AOP in its class-path was
  deserializing objects, they could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the JBoss Application Server process via a
  specially-crafted, serialized Java object. (CVE-2011-2894)

  Note: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform does not expose applications that
  deserialize objects from an untrusted source by default. These flaws would
  affect applications configured to trust a malicious source, for example,
  if the messaging service was configured to look up a remote messaging
  queue, and an attacker had control of that queue.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update. Refer to the
  Solution section for information about installing the update.
