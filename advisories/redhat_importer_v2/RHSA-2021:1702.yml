  - CVE-2020-8927
summary: "An update for brotli is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for\
  \ each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nBrotli is a generic-purpose\
  \ lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant\
  \ of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression\
  \ ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It\
  \ is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\
  \n* brotli: buffer overflow when input chunk is larger than 2GiB (CVE-2020-8927)\n\nFor more\
  \ details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments,\
  \ and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\
  \nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Release Notes linked from the References section."
