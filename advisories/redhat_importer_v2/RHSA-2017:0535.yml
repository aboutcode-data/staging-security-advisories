summary: |
  An update for policycoreutils is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The policycoreutils packages contain the core policy utilities required to manage a SELinux environment.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that the sandbox tool provided in policycoreutils was vulnerable to a TIOCSTI ioctl attack. A specially crafted program executed via the sandbox command could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the parent shell, escaping the sandbox. (CVE-2016-7545)
