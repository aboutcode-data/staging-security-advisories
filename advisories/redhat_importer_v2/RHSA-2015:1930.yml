  - CVE-2015-5300
  - CVE-2015-7704
summary: |
  Updated ntp packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
  with a referenced time source.

  It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check timestamps
  in Kiss-of-Death packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
  crafted Kiss-of-Death packet to an ntpd client that would increase the
  client's polling interval value, and effectively disable synchronization
  with the server. (CVE-2015-7704)

  It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the threshold limitation
  for the '-g' option, which is used to set the time without any
  restrictions. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to intercept NTP traffic
  between a connecting client and an NTP server could use this flaw to force
  that client to make multiple steps larger than the panic threshold,
  effectively changing the time to an arbitrary value. (CVE-2015-5300)

  Red Hat would like to thank Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon
  Goldberg of Boston University for reporting these issues.

  All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
  update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.
