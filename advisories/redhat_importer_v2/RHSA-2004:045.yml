summary: "Updated Gaim packages that fix a pair of security vulnerabilities are now\navailable.\n\
  \nGaim is an instant messenger client that can handle multiple protocols.\n\nStefan Esser\
  \ audited the Gaim source code and found a number of bugs that\nhave security implications.\
  \  Many of these bugs do not affect the version\nof Gaim distributed with version 2.1 of Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux. \n\nA buffer overflow exists in the HTTP Proxy connect code.  If Gaim\
  \ is\nconfigured to use an HTTP proxy for connecting to a server, a malicious\nHTTP proxy\
  \ could run arbitrary code as the user running Gaim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0006 to this issue.\n\nAn integer\
  \ overflow in Gaim 0.74 and earlier, when allocating memory for a\ndirectIM packet for AIM/Oscar,\
  \ results in heap overflow. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0008 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Gaim should upgrade to these\
  \ erratum packages, which contain\na backported security patch correcting this issue.\n\n\
  Red Hat would like to thank Steffan Esser for finding and reporting these\nissues and Jacques\
  \ A. Vidrine for providing initial patches."
