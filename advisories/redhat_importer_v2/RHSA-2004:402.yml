summary: "Updated libpng packages that fix several issues are now available.\n\nThe libpng package\
  \ contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics)\
  \ image format files.\n\nDuring a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered several buffer\
  \ overflows\nin libpng.  An attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a\n\
  way that it would cause an application linked with libpng to execute\narbitrary code when\
  \ the file was opened by a victim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0597 to these issues.  \n\nIn addition, this audit discovered\
  \ a potential NULL pointer dereference in\nlibpng (CAN-2004-0598) and several integer overflow\
  \ issues (CAN-2004-0599).\nAn attacker could create a carefully crafted PNG file in such a\
  \ way that\nit would cause an application linked with libpng to crash when the file was\n\
  opened by the victim.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Chris Evans for discovering these issues.\n\
  \nFor users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 these patches also include a more\ncomplete fix\
  \ for the out of bounds memory access flaw (CAN-2002-1363). \n\nAll users are advised to update\
  \ to the updated libpng packages which\ncontain backported security patches and are not vulnerable\
  \ to these issues."
