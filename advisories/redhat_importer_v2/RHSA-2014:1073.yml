  - CVE-2014-1492
summary: |
  Updated nss, nss-util, and nss-softokn packages that fix one security
  issue, several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSLv3, TLS, and other
  security standards.

  It was found that the implementation of Internationalizing Domain Names in
  Applications (IDNA) hostname matching in NSS did not follow the RFC 6125
  recommendations. This could lead to certain invalid certificates with
  international characters to be accepted as valid. (CVE-2014-1492)

  In addition, the nss, nss-util, and nss-softokn packages have been upgraded
  to upstream version 3.16.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and
  enhancements over the previous versions. (BZ#1124659)

  Users of NSS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
  update, applications using NSS must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
