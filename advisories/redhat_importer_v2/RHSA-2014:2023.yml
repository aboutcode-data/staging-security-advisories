  - CVE-2014-7817
summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
  libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name
  Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
  Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  It was found that the wordexp() function would perform command substitution
  even when the WRDE_NOCMD flag was specified. An attacker able to provide
  specially crafted input to an application using the wordexp() function, and
  not sanitizing the input correctly, could potentially use this flaw to
  execute arbitrary commands with the credentials of the user running that
  application. (CVE-2014-7817)

  This issue was discovered by Tim Waugh of the Red Hat Developer Experience
  Team.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, if a file stream that was opened in append mode and
  its underlying file descriptor were used at the same time and the file was
  truncated using the ftruncate() function on the file descriptor, a
  subsequent ftell() call on the stream incorrectly modified the file offset
  by seeking to the new end of the file. This update ensures that ftell()
  modifies the state of the file stream only when it is in append mode and
  its buffer is not empty. As a result, the described incorrect changes to
  the file offset no longer occur. (BZ#1170187)

  All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
