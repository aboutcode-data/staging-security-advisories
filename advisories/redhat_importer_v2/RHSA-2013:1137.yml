  - CVE-2013-4073
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-ruby packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language.
  It has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

  A flaw was found in Ruby's SSL client's hostname identity check when
  handling certificates that contain hostnames with NULL bytes. An attacker
  could potentially exploit this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to
  spoof SSL servers. Note that to exploit this issue, an attacker would need
  to obtain a carefully-crafted certificate signed by an authority that the
  client trusts. (CVE-2013-4073)

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.2 are advised to upgrade to
  these updated packages, which resolve this issue.
