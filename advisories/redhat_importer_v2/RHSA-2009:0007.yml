summary: "Updated rhpki-common packages that fix security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Certificate System 7.3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nRed Hat Certificate System (RHCS) is an enterprise\
  \ software system designed\nto manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.\n\
  \nIt was discovered that Red Hat Certificate System used insecure default\nfile permissions\
  \ on certain configuration files (for example,\npassword.conf) that may contain authentication\
  \ credentials. These \ncredentials should only be accessible to administrative and service\
  \ users. \nA local user could use this flaw to read Red Hat Certificate System \nconfiguration\
  \ files containing sensitive information. (CVE-2008-2367)\n\nIt was discovered that Red Hat\
  \ Certificate System stored plain text\npasswords in multiple debug log files with insufficient\
  \ access restrictions\n(for example, the UserDirEnrollment log and the RA wizard installer\
  \ log). A\nlocal user could use this flaw to extract plain text passwords from the Red\nHat\
  \ Certificate System debug log files. (CVE-2008-2368)\n\nIt was discovered that the Token\
  \ Processing System (TPS) component of the\nRed Hat Certificate System did not properly verify\
  \ the challenge response\nreceived during the enrollment of a new security token. An attacker\
  \ with\naccess to a blank token known to the TPS component and with privileges to\nperform\
  \ new token enrollments could use this flaw to complete the\nenrollment procedure with a software-generated\
  \ key instead of the key\nstored in the hardware token. (CVE-2008-5082)\n\nThese updated packages\
  \ fix the following bugs:\n\n* The end-entities enrollment pages have been updated to support\
  \ the \ncertenroll.dll library used on Microsoft Vista, so Internet Explorer can \nbe used\
  \ on to enroll certificates on Vista.\n\n* The password used by the LDAP publisher was improperly\
  \ stored in the CA \nconfiguration. This essentially required that the LDAP publishing password\n\
  had to be the same as the internal database (LDAP directory) password, or \nLDAP publishing\
  \ would break. A new parameter was added to the CA CS.cfg \nfile to define an LDAP publishing\
  \ password parameter in the CA's \npassword.conf file.\n\n* The secure ports used by subsystem\
  \ interfaces — the administrative \nconsole, agent pages, and end-entities pages — are, by\
  \ default, the same. \nIt is possible with this errata to run those services on separate port,\n\
  which provides additional protection by prohibiting agents and users from\naccessing the same\
  \ TCP port and web services directory.\n\n* The certificate policies extension was not processed\
  \ by CMSServlet.\n\n* Any IP Address defined in a certificate's SubjectAltName parameter was\
  \ \nimproperly coded as an 8-byte number, with the last 4 bytes trailing zeros \n(00 00 00\
  \ 00).\n\n* The subject name uniqueness plug-in in the CA profiles, which enforces \nunique\
  \ names for all active certificates, would reject a certificate \nrequest which reused a subject\
  \ name even if the previous certificate had \nbeen revoked or expired.\n\n* The TPS dependences\
  \ have been changed from MozLDAP5 to MozLDAP6.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Certificate System\
  \ 7.3 should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolves these issues."
