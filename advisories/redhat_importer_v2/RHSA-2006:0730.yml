  - CVE-2006-5465
summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix a security issue are now available.\n\nThis update has\
  \ been rated as having important security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\
  \nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\
  \ \n\nThe Hardened-PHP Project discovered an overflow in the PHP htmlentities()\nand htmlspecialchars()\
  \ routines.  If a PHP script used the vulnerable\nfunctions to parse UTF-8 data, a remote\
  \ attacker sending a carefully\ncrafted request could trigger the overflow and potentially\
  \ execute\narbitrary code as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2006-5465) \n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue."
