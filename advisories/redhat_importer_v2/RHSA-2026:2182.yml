aliases:
  - CVE-2026-0719
  - CVE-2026-1761
summary: |
  An update for libsoup3 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate packages.  libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK applications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who want it), but the SOAP parts were removed long ago.

  Security Fix(es):

  * libsoup: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error Leading to Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in libsoup NTLM Authentication (CVE-2026-0719)

  * libsoup: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in libsoup Multipart Response Parsingmultipart HTTP response (CVE-2026-1761)
