summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A flaw was found in Sanitiser for OpenType (OTS), used by Thunderbird to
  help prevent potential exploits in malformed OpenType fonts. Malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain conditions,
  possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3062)

  Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2012-0467, CVE-2012-0468, CVE-2012-0469)

  Content containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file
  could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
  with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-0470)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird used its embedded Cairo library to
  render certain fonts. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash
  or, under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-0472)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird rendered certain images using
  WebGL. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain
  conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-0478)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled
  certain multibyte character sets. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird
  to run JavaScript code with the permissions of different content.
  (CVE-2012-0471)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird rendered certain graphics using
  WebGL. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash. (CVE-2012-0473)

  A flaw in the built-in feed reader in Thunderbird allowed the Website field
  to display the address of different content than the content the user was
  visiting. An attacker could use this flaw to conceal a malicious URL,
  possibly tricking a user into believing they are viewing a trusted site, or
  allowing scripts to be loaded from the attacker's site, possibly leading to
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2012-0474)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded the ISO-2022-KR and
  ISO-2022-CN character sets. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird
  to run JavaScript code with the permissions of different content.
  (CVE-2012-0477)

  A flaw was found in the way the built-in feed reader in Thunderbird handled
  RSS and Atom feeds. Invalid RSS or Atom content loaded over HTTPS caused
  Thunderbird to display the address of said content, but not the content.
  The previous content continued to be displayed. An attacker could use this
  flaw to perform phishing attacks, or trick users into thinking they are
  visiting the site reported by the Website field, when the page is actually
  content controlled by an attacker. (CVE-2012-0479)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.

  reporter of CVE-2012-0469; Atte Kettunen from OUSPG as the original

  CVE-2012-0478; Anne van Kesteren of Opera Software as the original reporter
  of CVE-2012-0471; Matias Juntunen as the original reporter of
  CVE-2012-0473; Jordi Chancel and Eddy Bordi, and Chris McGowen as the

  reporter of CVE-2012-0477; and Jeroen van der Gun as the original reporter
  of CVE-2012-0479.

  Note: All issues except CVE-2012-0470, CVE-2012-0472, and CVE-2011-3062
  cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript
  is disabled by default for mail messages. It could be exploited another way
  in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full remote content of an
  RSS feed.
