  - CVE-2014-4877
summary: |
  An updated wget package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The wget package provides the GNU Wget file retrieval utility for HTTP,
  HTTPS, and FTP protocols.

  A flaw was found in the way Wget handled symbolic links. A malicious FTP
  server could allow Wget running in the mirror mode (using the '-m' command
  line option) to write an arbitrary file to a location writable to by the
  user running Wget, possibly leading to code execution. (CVE-2014-4877)

  Note: This update changes the default value of the --retr-symlinks option.
  The file symbolic links are now traversed by default and pointed-to files
  are retrieved rather than creating a symbolic link locally.

  Red Hat would like to thank the GNU Wget project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges HD Moore of Rapid7, Inc as the original reporter.

  All users of wget are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
