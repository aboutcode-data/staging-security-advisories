  - CVE-2005-1704
summary: "An updated binutils package that fixes several bugs and minor security\nissues is\
  \ now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\n\
  Security Response Team.\n\nBinutils is a collection of utilities used for the creation of\
  \ executable\ncode. A number of bugs were found in various binutils tools.  \n\nSeveral integer\
  \ overflow bugs were found in binutils. If a user is tricked\ninto processing a specially\
  \ crafted executable with utilities such as\nreadelf, size, strings, objdump, or nm, it may\
  \ allow the execution of\narbitrary code as the user running the utility. The Common Vulnerabilities\n\
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1704\nto this issue.\n\
  \nAdditionally, the following bugs have been fixed:\n\n-- correct alignment of .tbss section\
  \ if the requested alignment\n   of .tbss is bigger than requested alignment of .tdata section\n\
  -- by default issue an error if IA-64 hint@pause instruction is\n   put into the B slot, add\
  \ assembler command line switch to\n   override this behaviour\n\nAll users of binutils should\
  \ upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues."
