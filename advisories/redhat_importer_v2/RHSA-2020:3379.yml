  - CVE-2020-8617
summary: |
  An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * bind: BIND does not sufficiently limit the number of fetches performed when processing referrals (CVE-2020-8616)

  * bind: A logic error in code which checks TSIG validity can be used to trigger an assertion failure in tsig.c (CVE-2020-8617)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
