summary: |
  Updated cfme packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
  automation enterprises need to address the challenges of managing virtual
  environments, which are far more complex than physical ones. This
  technology enables enterprises with existing virtual infrastructures
  to improve visibility and control, and those just starting virtualization
  deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual infrastructure.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Ruby parsed floating point
  numbers from their text representation. If an application using Ruby
  accepted untrusted input strings and converted them to floating point
  numbers, an attacker able to provide such input could cause the application
  to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  application. (CVE-2013-4164)

  It was found that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine did not properly
  sanitize user-supplied values in the ServiceController. A remote attacker
  could invoke arbitrary method calls in the application controller that, due
  to a lack of sanitization, could allow access to private methods that could
  possibly allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system.
  (CVE-2014-0057)

  It was found that several number conversion helpers in Action View did not
  properly escape all their parameters. An attacker could use these flaws to
  perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
  data submitted by a user as parameters to the affected helpers.
  (CVE-2014-0081)

  A memory consumption issue was discovered in the text rendering component
  of Action View. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial
  of service attack by sending specially crafted queries that would result in
  the creation of Ruby symbols that were never garbage collected.
  (CVE-2014-0082)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails Project for reporting
  CVE-2014-0081 and CVE-2014-0082. Upstream acknowledges Kevin Reintjes as
  the original reporter of CVE-2014-0081, and Toby Hsieh of SlideShare as the
  original reporter of CVE-2014-0082. The CVE-2014-0057 issue was discovered
  by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

  This update fixes several bugs and adds multiple enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat
  CloudForms 3.0 Management Engine 5.2 Technical Notes linked to in the
  References section.

  All users of Red Hat CloudForms are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements.
