  - CVE-2014-9112
summary: "Updated cpio packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now \navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Moderate security \nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\n\
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nThe cpio packages provide the GNU cpio utility for creating and extracting\narchives, or\
  \ copying files from one place to another.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found\
  \ in cpio's list_file() function.\nAn attacker could provide a specially crafted archive that,\
  \ when processed\nby cpio, would crash cpio, or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\
  (CVE-2014-9112)\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, during archive creation,\
  \ cpio internals did not detect a\nread() system call failure. Based on the premise that the\
  \ call succeeded,\ncpio terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault without processing\n\
  further files. The underlying source code has been patched, and an archive\nis now created\
  \ successfully. (BZ#1138148)\n\n* Previously, running the cpio command without parameters\
  \ on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 7 with Russian as the default language resulted in an\nerror\
  \ message that was not accurate in Russian due to an error in spelling.\nThis has been corrected\
  \ and the Russian error message is spelled correctly.\n(BZ#1075513)\n\nAll cpio users are\
  \ advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct\
  \ these issues."
