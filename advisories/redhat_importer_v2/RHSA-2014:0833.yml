summary: |
  An update for the Apache Tomcat 6 component for Red Hat JBoss Web Server
  2.0.1 that fixes three security issues is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  It was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk
  sizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming
  an unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server
  resources. (CVE-2014-0075)

  It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when
  parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located
  behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly.
  (CVE-2014-0099)

  It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet
  implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External
  Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this
  to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive
  information. (CVE-2014-0096)

  The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web
  Server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
