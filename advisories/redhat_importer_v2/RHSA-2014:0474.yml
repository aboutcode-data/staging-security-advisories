  - CVE-2014-0114
summary: |
  Updated struts packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Apache Struts is a framework for building web applications with Java.

  It was found that the Struts 1 ActionForm object allowed access to the
  'class' parameter, which is directly mapped to the getClass() method. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the ClassLoader used by
  an application server running Struts 1. This could lead to remote code
  execution under certain conditions. (CVE-2014-0114)

  All struts users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  using struts must be restarted for this update to take effect.
