  - CVE-2011-1775
summary: |
  Updated tigervnc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system which allows you
  to view a computer's desktop environment not only on the machine where it
  is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of
  machine architectures. TigerVNC is a suite of VNC servers and clients.

  It was discovered that vncviewer could prompt for and send authentication
  credentials to a remote server without first properly validating the
  server's X.509 certificate. As vncviewer did not indicate that the
  certificate was bad or missing, a man-in-the-middle attacker could use this
  flaw to trick a vncviewer client into connecting to a spoofed VNC server,
  allowing the attacker to obtain the client's credentials. (CVE-2011-1775)

  All tigervnc users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue.
