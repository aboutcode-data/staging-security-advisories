  - CVE-2011-4028
summary: |
  Updated xorg-x11-server packages that fix one security issue and various
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  X.Org is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It provides
  the basic low-level functionality that full-fledged graphical user
  interfaces are designed upon.

  A flaw was found in the way the X.Org server handled lock files. A local
  user with access to the system console could use this flaw to determine the
  existence of a file in a directory not accessible to the user, via a
  symbolic link attack. (CVE-2011-4028)

  Red Hat would like to thank the researcher with the nickname vladz for
  reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * In rare cases, if the front and back buffer of the miDbePositionWindow()
  function were not both allocated in video memory, or were both allocated in
  system memory, the X Window System sometimes terminated unexpectedly. A
  patch has been provided to address this issue and X no longer crashes in
  the described scenario. (BZ#596899)

  * Previously, when the miSetShape() function called the miRegionDestroy()
  function with a NULL region, X terminated unexpectedly if the backing store
  was enabled. Now, X no longer crashes in the described scenario.
  (BZ#676270)

  * On certain workstations running in 32-bit mode, the X11 mouse cursor
  occasionally became stuck near the left edge of the X11 screen. A patch has
  been provided to address this issue and the mouse cursor no longer becomes
  stuck in the described scenario. (BZ#529717)

  * On certain workstations with a dual-head graphics adapter using the r500
  driver in Zaphod mode, the mouse pointer was confined to one monitor screen
  and could not move to the other screen. A patch has been provided to
  address this issue and the mouse cursor works properly across both screens.
  (BZ#559964)

  * Due to a double free operation, Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) terminated
  unexpectedly with a segmentation fault randomly when the last client
  disconnected, that is when the server reset. This bug has been fixed in the
  miDCCloseScreen() function and Xvfb no longer crashes. (BZ#674741)

  * Starting the Xephyr server on an AMD64 or Intel 64 architecture with an
  integrated graphics adapter caused the server to terminate unexpectedly.
  This bug has been fixed in the code and Xephyr no longer crashes in the
  described scenario. (BZ#454409)

  * Previously, when a client made a request bigger than 1/4th of the limit
  advertised in the BigRequestsEnable reply, the X server closed the
  connection unexpectedly. With this update, the maxBigRequestSize variable
  has been added to the code to check the size of client requests, thus
  fixing this bug. (BZ#555000)

  * When an X client running on a big-endian system called the
  XineramaQueryScreens() function, the X server terminated unexpectedly. This
  bug has been fixed in the xf86Xinerama module and the X server no longer
  crashes in the described scenario. (BZ#588346)

  * When installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 on an IBM eServer System p
  blade server, the installer did not set the correct mode on the built-in
  KVM (Keyboard-Video-Mouse). Consequently, the graphical installer took a
  very long time to appear and then was displayed incorrectly. A patch has
  been provided to address this issue and the graphical installer now works
  as expected in the described scenario. Note that this fix requires the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.8 kernel update. (BZ#740497)

  * Lines longer than 46,340 pixels can be drawn with one of the coordinates
  being negative. However, for dashed lines, the miPolyBuildPoly() function
  overflowed the "int" type when setting up edges for a section of a dashed
  line. Consequently, dashed segments were not drawn at all. An upstream
  patch has been applied to address this issue and dashed lines are now drawn
  correctly. (BZ#649810)

  All users of xorg-x11-server are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. All running X.Org server instances
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
