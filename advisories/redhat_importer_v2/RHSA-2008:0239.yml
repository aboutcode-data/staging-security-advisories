  - CVE-2008-1693
summary: |
  Updated poppler packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Poppler is a PDF rendering library, used by applications such as Evince.

  Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the way poppler displayed malformed fonts
  embedded in PDF files. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that
  would cause applications that use poppler -- such as Evince -- to crash,
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2008-1693)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve this issue.
