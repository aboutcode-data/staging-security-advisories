summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Extended Update Support.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * a flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
  the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
  than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
  partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
  could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
  (CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538, Important)

  * a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux
  kernel. Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network
  cards supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
  service. (CVE-2009-4537, Important)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
