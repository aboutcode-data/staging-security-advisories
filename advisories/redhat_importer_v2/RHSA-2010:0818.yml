  - CVE-2010-2793
summary: |
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 2.2.4 is now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Virtualization.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
  managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
  administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol.

  A race condition was found in the way the SPICE plug-in for Microsoft
  Internet Explorer and the SPICE client communicated. A local attacker could
  use this flaw to trick the plug-in and the SPICE client into communicating
  over an attacker-controlled named pipe, possibly gaining access to
  authentication details, or resulting in privilege escalation.
  (CVE-2010-2793)

  several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will be available shortly
  from http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/
