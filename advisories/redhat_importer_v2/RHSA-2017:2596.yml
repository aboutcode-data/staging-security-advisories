  Groovy is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine, built upon Java with features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk. It seamlessly integrates with all existing Java objects and libraries and compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Multiple object deserialization flaws were discovered in the MethodClosure class in Groovy. A specially crafted serialized object deserialized by an application using the Groovy library could cause the application to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-3253, CVE-2016-6814)
