  - CVE-2015-3214
  - CVE-2015-5154
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6 and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's IDE subsystem
  handled I/O buffer access while processing certain ATAPI commands.
  A privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could
  potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
  privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to the guest.
  (CVE-2015-5154)

  An out-of-bounds memory access flaw, leading to memory corruption or
  possibly an information leak, was found in QEMU's pit_ioport_read()
  function. A privileged guest user in a QEMU guest, which had QEMU PIT
  emulation enabled, could potentially, in rare cases, use this flaw to
  execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting QEMU
  process. (CVE-2015-3214)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security
  team for reporting the CVE-2015-3214 issue. The CVE-2015-5154 issue was
  discovered by Kevin Wolf of Red Hat.

  All qemu-kvm-rhev users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual
  machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
