summary: |
  Updated packages that fix several security issues and add one enhancement
  are now available for Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4.1 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite provides a solution to organizations
  requiring absolute control over and privacy of the maintenance and package
  deployment of their servers. It allows organizations to utilize the
  benefits of the Red Hat Network without having to provide public Internet
  access to their servers or other client systems.

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the RHN Satellite
  web interface. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform a
  cross-site scripting attack against victims using the RHN Satellite web
  interface. (CVE-2011-2919, CVE-2011-2920, CVE-2011-2927, CVE-2011-3344)

  An open redirect flaw was found in the RHN Satellite web interface login
  page. A remote attacker able to trick a victim to open the login page using
  a specially-crafted link could redirect the victim to an arbitrary page
  after they successfully log in. (CVE-2011-1594)

  Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Karanja Muturi for reporting
  CVE-2011-2919; Nils Juenemann and The Bearded Warriors for independently
  reporting CVE-2011-2920; Nils Juenemann for reporting CVE-2011-2927;
  Sylvain Maes for reporting CVE-2011-3344; and Thomas Biege of the SuSE
  Security Team for reporting CVE-2011-1594.

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * Session cookies set by RHN Satellite are now marked as HTTPOnly. This
  setting helps reduce the impact of cross-site scripting flaws by
  instructing the browser to disallow scripts access to those cookies.
  (BZ#713477)

  Users of Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain patches to correct these issues and add
  this enhancement. For this update to take effect, Red Hat Network Satellite
  must be restarted. Refer to the Solution section for details.
