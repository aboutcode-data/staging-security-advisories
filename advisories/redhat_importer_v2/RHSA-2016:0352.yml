  - CVE-2016-0757
summary: "Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo)\nfor RHEL 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security\
  \ has rated this update as having a Low\nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System\
  \ (CVSS) base scores,\nwhich give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\n\
  from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nOpenStack Image Service (glance) provides\
  \ discovery, registration, and\ndelivery services for disk and server images. The service\
  \ provides the\nability to copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away.\
  \ \nStored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running \nquickly and\
  \ more consistently than installing a server operating system\nand individually configuring\
  \ additional services.\n\nAn authorization vulnerability in OpenStack Image service was discovered,\n\
  which allowed image-status manipulation using locations. By removing the\nlast location of\
  \ an image, an authenticated user could change the status\nfrom 'active' to 'queue'. A malicious\
  \ tenant could exploit this flaw to \nsilently replace owned image data, regardless of its\
  \ original creator or \nvisibility settings. Only environments with show_multiple_locations\
  \ set\nto true (not default) were affected. (CVE-2016-0757)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank\
  \ the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Erno Kuvaja of HPE\
  \ as the original reporter.\n\nAll openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated\npackages, which address this vulnerability."
