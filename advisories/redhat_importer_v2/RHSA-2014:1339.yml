  - CVE-2014-3632
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
  system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
  function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
  as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

  It was discovered that the openstack-neutron package in Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux Open Stack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was released
  with a sudoers file containing a configuration error. This error caused
  OpenStack Networking to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-6433 issue.
  (CVE-2014-3632)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the Open vSwitch agent failed to process ports on
  the integration bridge that quickly disappeared and reappeared during the
  processing loop. When such a failure occurred, the processing of the port
  was aborted (which is the correct behavior), but it was also marked as
  processed, meaning that the next updates for the port were not applied when
  it reappeared later. As a consequence, some ports were not VLAN-tagged
  correctly, and that resulted in no network connectivity for those instances
  that were bound to those ports. With this update, ports that are not on the
  integration bridge are still not processed but also not marked as such.
  Ports that disappear and then reappear later on the integration bridge are
  processed correctly, and VLAN tag updates are properly applied.
  (BZ#1123053)

  * This update fixes an issue that caused connectivity to be dropped when
  restarting the openvswitch service with l2pop enabled. (BZ#1120719)

  * Due to an incorrect version of the python-httplib2 package specified in
  the spec file, when a large amount of virtual machines (VMs) was launched,
  some of the VMs could be assigned two private IP addresses. (BZ#1126451)

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
