summary: |
  Updated ppc64-diag packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The ppc64-diag packages provide diagnostic tools for Linux on the 64-bit
  PowerPC platforms. The platform diagnostics write events reported by the
  firmware to the service log, provide automated responses to urgent events,
  and notify system administrators or connected service frameworks about the
  reported events.

  Multiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in the way the
  ppc64-diag utility created certain temporary files. A local attacker could
  possibly use either of these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack and
  overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
  ppc64-diag, or obtain sensitive information from the temporary files.
  (CVE-2014-4038, CVE-2014-4039)

  The ppc64-diag packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.6.7, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#1148142)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the "explain_syslog" and "syslog_to_svclog" commands failed
  with a "No such file or directory" error message. With this update, the
  ppc64-diag package specifies the location of the message_catalog directory
  correctly, which prevents the described error from occurring. (BZ#1139655)

  * Prior to this update, the /var/lock/subsys/rtas_errd file was incorrectly
  labeled for SELinux as "system_u:object_r:var_lock_t:s0". This update
  corrects the SELinux label to "system_u:object_r:rtas_errd_var_lock_t:s0".
  (BZ#1131501)

  Users of ppc64-diag are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements.
