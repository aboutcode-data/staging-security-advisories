aliases:
  - CVE-2015-1848
  - CVE-2015-3983
summary: |
  Updated pcs packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The pcs packages provide a command-line tool and a web UI to configure and
  manage the Pacemaker and Corosync tools.

  It was found that the pcs daemon did not sign cookies containing session
  data that were sent to clients connecting via the pcsd web UI. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to forge cookies and bypass authorization
  checks, possibly gaining elevated privileges in the pcsd web UI. Note: the
  pcsd web UI is not enabled by default. (CVE-2015-1848)

  This issue was discovered by Tomas Jelinek of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * When the IPv6 protocol was disabled on a system, starting the pcsd daemon
  on this system previously failed. This update adds the ability for pcsd to
  fall back to IPv4 when IPv6 is not available. As a result, pcsd starts
  properly and uses IPv4 if IPv6 is disabled. (BZ#1212115)

  All pcs users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the pcsd daemon will be restarted automatically.
