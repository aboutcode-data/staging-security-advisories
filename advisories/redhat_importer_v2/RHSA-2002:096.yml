summary: "The unzip and tar utilities contain vulnerabilities which can allow\narbitrary files\
  \ to be overwritten during archive extraction.\n\n[updated Jan 22 2003]\nAdded description\
  \ of CAN-2002-1216 which was also fixed by these erratum\npackages\n\nThe unzip and tar utilities\
  \ are used for manipulating archives, which\nare multiple files stored inside of a single\
  \ file.\n\nA directory traversal vulnerability in unzip version 5.42 and earlier,\nas well\
  \ as GNU tar 1.13.19 and earlier, allows attackers to overwrite\narbitrary files during archive\
  \ extraction via a \"..\" (dot dot) in an\nextracted filename. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2001-1267 and CAN-2001-1268\
  \ to\nthis issue. \n\nIn addition, unzip version 5.42 and earlier also allows attackers to\n\
  overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via filenames in the\narchive that begin\
  \ with the \"/\" (slash) character. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2001-1269 to this issue.\n\nDuring testing of the fix to GNU\
  \ tar, it was discovered that GNU tar\n1.13.25 was still vulnerable to a modified version\
  \ of the same problem. Red\nHat has provided a patch to tar 1.3.25 to correct this problem.\
  \ The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\n\
  CAN-2002-0399 to this issue.\n\nGNU tar 1.13.19 and other versions before 1.13.25 allow remote\
  \ attackers\nto overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack, as the result of a\nmodification\
  \ that effectively disabled the security check.  This issue\naffects only Red Hat Linux 7.1\
  \ and 7.2.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2002-1216 to\nthis issue.\n\nUsers of unzip and tar are advised to upgrade\
  \ to these errata packages,\ncontaining unzip version 5.50 (for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1,\
  \ and 7.2) and\na patched version of GNU tar 1.13.25 (for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1, 7.2,\n\
  and 7.3), which are not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nImportant Note: For users of Red Hat\
  \ Linux 6.2 and 7 only, these errata\npackages change one of the command line options for\
  \ tar.  Previously the\n'-I' option was used to enable bzip2 compression, while in these errata\n\
  packages the option has changed to '-j'."
