summary: |
  Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processes certain malformed
  Javascript code. A malicious HTML mail message could cause the execution of
  Javascript code in such a way that could cause Thunderbird to crash or
  execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-5463,
  CVE-2006-5747, CVE-2006-5748)

  Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird renders HTML mail messages.
  A malicious HTML mail message could cause the mail client to crash or
  possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2006-5464)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird verifies RSA signatures. For RSA
  keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature
  that would be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Thunderbird as
  shipped trusts several root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An
  attacker could have created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which would
  be incorrectly trusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw
  was previously thought to be fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich
  Kuehn discovered the fix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)

  Users of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
  Thunderbird version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.
