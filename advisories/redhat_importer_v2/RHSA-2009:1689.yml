  - CVE-2009-4133
summary: |
  Updated condor packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Condor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive
  jobs. It provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority
  scheme, and resource monitoring and management.

  A flaw was found in the way Condor managed jobs. This could allow a user
  that is authorized to submit jobs into Condor to queue a job as if it were
  submitted by a different local user, potentially leading to unauthorized
  access to that user's account. (CVE-2009-4133)

  Note: Condor will not run jobs as root; therefore, this flaw cannot lead to
  a compromise of the root user account.

  All Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2 users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  Condor must be restarted for the update to take effect.
