summary: |
  Updated quagga packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Quagga is a TCP/IP based routing software suite. The Quagga bgpd daemon
  implements the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing protocol.

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Quagga bgpd
  daemon processed certain BGP Route Refresh (RR) messages. A configured BGP
  peer could send a specially-crafted BGP message, causing bgpd on a target
  system to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
  the user running bgpd. (CVE-2010-2948)

  Note: On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 it is not possible to exploit
  CVE-2010-2948 to run arbitrary code as the overflow is blocked by
  FORTIFY_SOURCE.

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the way the Quagga
  bgpd daemon processed certain specially-crafted BGP messages. A configured
  BGP peer could crash bgpd on a target system via specially-crafted BGP
  messages. (CVE-2007-4826)

  Users of quagga should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the bgpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
