  - CVE-2014-3615
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.

  An information leak flaw was found in the way QEMU's VGA emulator accessed
  frame buffer memory for high resolution displays. A privileged guest user
  could use this flaw to leak memory contents of the host to the guest by
  setting the display to use a high resolution in the guest. (CVE-2014-3615)

  This issue was discovered by Laszlo Ersek of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * This update fixes a regression in the scsi_block_new_request() function,
  which caused all read requests to through SG_IO if the host cache was not
  used. (BZ#1141189)

  All qemu-kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines
  have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
