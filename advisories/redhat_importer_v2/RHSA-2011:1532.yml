summary: |
  An updated kexec-tools package that fixes three security issues, various
  bugs, and adds enhancements is now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Kexec allows for booting a Linux kernel from the context of an already
  running kernel.

  Kdump used the SSH (Secure Shell) "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" option when
  dumping to SSH targets, causing the target kdump server's SSH host key not
  to be checked. This could make it easier for a man-in-the-middle attacker
  on the local network to impersonate the kdump SSH target server and
  possibly gain access to sensitive information in the vmcore dumps.
  (CVE-2011-3588)

  mkdumprd created initrd files with world-readable permissions. A local user
  could possibly use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information, such
  as the private SSH key used to authenticate to a remote server when kdump
  was configured to dump to an SSH target. (CVE-2011-3589)

  mkdumprd included unneeded sensitive files (such as all files from the
  "/root/.ssh/" directory and the host's private SSH keys) in the resulting
  initrd. This could lead to an information leak when initrd files were
  previously created with world-readable permissions. Note: With this update,
  only the SSH client configuration, known hosts files, and the SSH key
  configured via the newly introduced sshkey option in "/etc/kdump.conf" are
  included in the initrd. The default is the key generated when running the
  "service kdump propagate" command, "/root/.ssh/kdump_id_rsa".
  (CVE-2011-3590)

  Red Hat would like to thank Kevan Carstensen for reporting these issues.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
  Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory.
  Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements will be available
  shortly from the Technical Notes document, linked to in the References
  section.

  All kexec-tools users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to resolve these issues and add these
  enhancements.
