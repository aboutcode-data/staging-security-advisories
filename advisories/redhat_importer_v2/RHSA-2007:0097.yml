summary: "Updated firefox packages that fix several security bugs are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.\n\
  \nFlaws were found in the way Firefox executed malformed JavaScript code. A\nmalicious web\
  \ page could cause Firefox to crash or allow arbitrary code \nto be executed as the user running\
  \ Firefox. (CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777)\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in\
  \ Firefox.  A malicious web\npage could display misleading information, allowing a user to\
  \ unknowingly\ndivulge sensitive information, such as a password. (CVE-2006-6077, \nCVE-2007-0995,\
  \ CVE-2007-0996)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox processed JavaScript contained in\n\
  certain tags.  A malicious web page could cause Firefox to execute\nJavaScript code with the\
  \ privileges of the user running Firefox.\n(CVE-2007-0994)\n\nA flaw was found in the way\
  \ Firefox cached web pages on the local disk. A\nmalicious web page may have been able to\
  \ inject arbitrary HTML into a\nbrowsing session if the user reloaded a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)\n\
  \nCertain web content could overlay Firefox user interface elements such as\nthe hostname\
  \ and security indicators.  A malicious web page could trick a\nuser into thinking they were\
  \ visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)\n\nTwo flaws were found in Firefox's displaying\
  \ of blocked popup windows. If a\nuser could be convinced to open a blocked popup, it was\
  \ possible to read\narbitrary local files, or conduct a cross-site scripting attack against\
  \ the\nuser.\n(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)\n\nTwo buffer overflow flaws were found in the\
  \ Network Security Services (NSS)\ncode for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a\
  \ malicious secure\nweb server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running\n\
  Firefox. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the\
  \ \"location.hostname\" value.\n A malicious web page could set domain cookies for an arbitrary\
  \ site, or\npossibly perform a cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2007-0981)\n\t\nUsers of\
  \ Firefox are advised to upgrade to this erratum package, containing\nFirefox version 1.5.0.10\
  \ which is not vulnerable to these issues."
