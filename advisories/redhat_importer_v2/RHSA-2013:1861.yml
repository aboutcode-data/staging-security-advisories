summary: |
  Updated nss packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications.

  It was found that a subordinate Certificate Authority (CA) mis-issued an
  intermediate certificate, which could be used to conduct man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This update renders that particular intermediate certificate as
  untrusted. (BZ#1038894)

  Note: This fix only applies to applications using the NSS Builtin Object
  Token. It does not render the certificates untrusted for applications that
  use the NSS library, but do not use the NSS Builtin Object Token.

  All NSS users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this
  issue. After installing the update, applications using NSS must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
