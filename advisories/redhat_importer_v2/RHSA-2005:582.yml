  - CVE-2005-1268
  - CVE-2005-2088
summary: |
  Updated Apache httpd packages to correct two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and
  freely-available Web server.

  Watchfire reported a flaw that occured when using the Apache server as an
  HTTP proxy.  A remote attacker could send an HTTP request with both a
  "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and a "Content-Length" header.  This
  caused Apache to incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request in
  a way that the receiving server processes it as a separate HTTP request.
  This could allow the bypass of Web application firewall protection or lead
  to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CAN-2005-2088 to this
  issue.

  Marc Stern reported an off-by-one overflow in the mod_ssl CRL verification
  callback.  In order to exploit this issue the Apache server would need to
  be configured to use a malicious certificate revocation list (CRL).   The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the
  name CAN-2005-1268 to this issue.

  Users of Apache httpd should update to these errata packages that contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
