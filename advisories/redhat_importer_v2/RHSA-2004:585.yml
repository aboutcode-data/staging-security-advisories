  - CVE-2004-0409
summary: |
  An updated xchat package that fixes a stack buffer overflow in the SOCKSv5
  proxy code.

  X-Chat is a graphical IRC chat client for the X Window System.

  A stack buffer overflow has been fixed in the SOCKSv5 proxy code.
  An attacker could create a malicious SOCKSv5 proxy server in such a way
  that X-Chat would execute arbitrary code if a victim configured X-Chat to
  use the proxy.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0409 to this issue.

  Users of X-Chat should upgrade to this erratum package, which contains a
  backported security patch, and is not vulnerable to this issue.
