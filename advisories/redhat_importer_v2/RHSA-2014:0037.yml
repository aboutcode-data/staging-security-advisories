summary: |
  An updated jasperreports-server-pro package that fixes two security issues,
  several bugs, and adds various enhancements is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization reports package provides a suite of
  pre-configured reports and dashboards that enable you to monitor the
  system. The reports module is based on JasperReports and JasperServer, and
  can also be used to create ad-hoc reports.

  Apache Axis did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name
  in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509
  certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL
  server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name.
  (CVE-2012-5784)

  A flaw was found in the Apache Hadoop RPC protocol. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could possibly use this flaw to unilaterally disable bidirectional
  authentication between a client and a server, forcing a downgrade to simple
  (unidirectional) authentication. This flaw only affects users who have
  enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. (CVE-2013-2192)

  This update fixes several bugs and adds multiple enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
  Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

  All jasperreports-server-pro users are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which contains backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements.
