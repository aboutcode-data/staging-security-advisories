  - CVE-2017-7805
summary: |
  An update for nss is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the TLS 1.2 implementation in the NSS library when client authentication was used. A malicious client could use this flaw to cause an application compiled against NSS to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running the application. (CVE-2017-7805)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Martin Thomson as the original reporter.
