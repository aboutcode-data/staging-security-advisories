summary: "Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging and Grid Update 1.2 is now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 5.\nThis new release includes updated classads, condor, condor-ec2-enhanced,\n\
  condor-ec2-enhanced-hooks, condor-job-hooks, condor-low-latency,\ncondor-remote-configuration,\
  \ python-qpid, qpid-java, qpidc, rhm,\nmrg-grid-docs and sesame packages that fix bugs and\
  \ add enhancements.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Real-time and Grid) is a real-time\
  \ IT\ninfrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG Messaging implements the\nAdvanced Message\
  \ Queuing Protocol (AMQP) standard, adding persistence\noptions, kernel optimizations, and\
  \ operating system services.\n\nThis update moves Red Hat Enterprise MRG to version 1.2 and\
  \ includes\nnumerous bug fixes and enhancements.\n\nMessaging enhancements include:\n\n- access\
  \ control lists (ACLs) can now be used when defining a queue with \nthe MRG Messaging Python\
  \ client. (BZ#523794)\n\nMessaging bug fixes include:\n\n- when a node in a cluster failed,\
  \ and was then brought back up, it was \nattempting to restore using information from both\
  \ the store, and the\nrunning master node. This resulted in the node that was attempting to\n\
  rejoin failing. This has been corrected, so that only the first node\nstarted in a cluster\
  \ will restore from the store. All subsequent nodes\nadded to the cluster will discard the\
  \ store data and will synchronize with\nthe master node in the cluster. Rejoining a running\
  \ cluster now operates as\nexpected. (483807)\n- some recovered flow-to-disk messages on replicated\
  \ queues could cause an \ninvalid frame sequence to be sent over the bridge that is transferring\n\
  replication events. This caused an \"unexpected command continuation frame\"\nerror on the\
  \ replication link. The frame sequencing order was corrected and\nthe link now conveys replication\
  \ events as normal. (514563)\n- if a queue had multiple consumers and a new member was added\
  \ to the \nqueue, it inconsistently allocated messages to consumers. This could result\nin\
  \ one node delivering a message of which the shadow sessions were unaware.\nSome nodes would\
  \ then record an error and shut down on detecting the\ninconsistency. The update process was\
  \ corrected and the inconsistent\ndelivery no longer occurs. This prevents errors, and all\
  \ nodes remain in\nthe cluster as expected. (516501)\n\nGrid enhancements include:\n\n- the\
  \ Job Router now supports multiple hook keywords to the Job Router. \nThe JOB_ROUTER_HOOK_KEYWORD\
  \ configuration option is used to define the\ndefault hook keyword. The hook keyword is used\
  \ for jobs routed by the job\nrouter. (463430)\n- messages produced by carod now carry the\
  \ same MessageId as exists in work\nsubmitting AMQP messages. This will assist in correlation\
  \ by submitter.\n(489009) \n- a new feature called vmuni has been added for configuration\
  \ of the VM \nuniverse. It allows configuring Xen and KVM virtual machines. The startd\nmust\
  \ be restarted (not just reconfigured) after configuration has been\napplied. (491237)\n\n\
  Grid bug fixes include:\n\n- added SCHEDD.QMF_STOREFILE = $(SPOOL)/.schedd_storefile to the\
  \ High \nAvailability Scheduler configuration. Jobs and schedulers no longer appear\nin cumin\
  \ twice after a scheduler failover. (486484)\n- if the MRG Messaging broker was restarted\
  \ while low-latency was running \non a Grid execute node, the low-latency daemon would stop\
  \ processing jobs\nand crash. The daemon now checks for disconnections and attempts to\nreconnect.\
  \ This prevents the daemon from crashing and will resume\nprocessing jobs once the broker\
  \ is running again. (488998)\n- HA_LOCK_HOLD_TIME and HA_POLL_PERIOD had default values that\
  \ could cause \na range of problems with failover. HA Schedd lock period has been\nshortened.\
  \ HA_LOCK_HOLD_TIME now defaults to 300 seconds, and\nHA_POLL_PERIOD to 60 seconds (these\
  \ parameters could be changed to lower\nvalues if faster fail-over is required), and failover\
  \ now works more\nreliably. (496227)\n\nThese updated packages include many other bug fixes\
  \ and enhancements. \nUsers are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2 Release Notes for\n\
  information on these changes:\n\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/\n\
  \nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users are advised to install this updated \npackage which fixes\
  \ the bugs and adds the enhancements noted in the Red Hat\nEnterprise MRG 1.2 Release Notes."
