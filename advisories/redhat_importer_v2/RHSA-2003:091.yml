summary: "Updated Kerberos packages for Red Hat Linux 9 fix a number of\nvulnerabilities found\
  \ in MIT Kerberos.\n\nKerberos is a network authentication system. The MIT Kerberos team\n\
  released an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the\nkerberos packages\
  \ shipped as part of Red Hat Linux 9. These issues include:\n\nVulnerabilities have been found\
  \ in the triple-DES key support found in the\nimplementation of the Kerberos IV authentication\
  \ protocol included in MIT\nKerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has\
  \ assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0139 to this issue.\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the\
  \ Kerberos IV authentication protocol\nwhich allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm\
  \ key, which is\nshared with another realm, to impersonate any principal in that realm to\n\
  any service in that realm. This vulnerability can only be closed by\ndisabling cross-realm\
  \ authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the\
  \ RPC library used by the kadmin\nservice in Kerberos 5. A faulty length check in the RPC\
  \ library exposes\nkadmind to an integer overflow which can be used to crash kadmind\n(CAN-2003-0028).\n\
  \nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers\nto cause a denial\
  \ of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm via a\ncertain protocol request that causes\
  \ the KDC to corrupt its heap\n(CAN-2003-0082).  \n\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to\
  \ upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich disable cross-realm authentication by default for\
  \ Kerberos IV and\nwhich contain patches that correct these issues."
