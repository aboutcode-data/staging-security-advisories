  The OpenJDK 21 packages provide the OpenJDK 21 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 21 Java Software Development Kit.

  This release of the Red Hat build of OpenJDK 21 (21.0.10) for portable Linux serves as a replacement for the Red Hat build of OpenJDK 21 (21.0.9) and includes security and bug fixes as well as enhancements. For further information, refer to the release notes linked to in the References section.

  Security Fix(es):

  * JDK: Improve JMX connections (CVE-2026-21925)

  * libpng: LIBPNG buffer overflow (CVE-2025-64720)

  * libpng: LIBPNG heap buffer overflow (CVE-2025-65018)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * When using a P11SecretKey for both signing and encryption in FIPS mode, the FIPS PKCS11 provider would fail with a CKR_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INVALID error. This was due to the default configuration not applying the CKA_ENCRYPT=true attribute to the key.  The configuration in this release is updated to include this attribute. (OPENJDK-4397)
