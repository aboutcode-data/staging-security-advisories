summary: |
  Updated kdegraphics packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop
  Environment, including KPDF, a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
  files.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in KPDF's JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause KPDF to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0147,
  CVE-2009-1179)

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in KPDF's JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause KPDF to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0146,
  CVE-2009-1182)

  Multiple flaws were found in KPDF's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the
  freeing of arbitrary memory. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file
  that would cause KPDF to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when
  opened. (CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)

  Multiple input validation flaws were found in KPDF's JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause KPDF to crash
  or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0800)

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in KPDF's JBIG2 decoder. An
  attacker could create a malicious PDF that would cause KPDF to crash when
  opened. (CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1183)

  Red Hat would like to thank Braden Thomas and Drew Yao of the Apple Product
  Security team, and Will Dormann of the CERT/CC for responsibly reporting
  these flaws.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
