summary: |
  Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 27th February 2008]
  The erratum text has been updated to include the details of additional
  issues that were fixed by these erratum packages, but which were not public
  at the time of release. No changes have been made to the packages.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird
  processed messages with external-body Multipurpose Internet Message
  Extensions (MIME) types. A HTML mail message containing malicious content
  could cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code as the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0304)

  Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain malformed
  HTML mail content. A HTML mail message containing malicious content could
  cause Thunderbird to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code as the
  user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0412, CVE-2008-0413, CVE-2008-0415,
  CVE-2008-0419)

  Several flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed malformed HTML
  mail content. A HTML mail message containing specially-crafted content
  could trick a user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2008-0420,
  CVE-2008-0591, CVE-2008-0593)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handles certain chrome URLs. If a
  user has certain extensions installed, it could allow a malicious HTML mail
  message to steal sensitive session data. Note: this flaw does not affect a
  default installation of Thunderbird. (CVE-2008-0418)

  Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird; the above
  issues are not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird saves certain text files. If a
  remote site offers a file of type "plain/text", rather than "text/plain",
  Thunderbird will not show future "text/plain" content to the user, forcing
  them to save those files locally to view the content. (CVE-2008-0592)

  Users of thunderbird are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
