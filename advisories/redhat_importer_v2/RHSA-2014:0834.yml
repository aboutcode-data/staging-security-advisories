summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix three security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
  and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  It was discovered that Apache Tomcat did not limit the length of chunk
  sizes when using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to perform a denial of service attack against Tomcat by streaming
  an unlimited quantity of data, leading to excessive consumption of server
  resources. (CVE-2014-0075)

  It was found that Apache Tomcat did not check for overflowing values when
  parsing request content length headers. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack on a Tomcat server located
  behind a reverse proxy that processed the content length header correctly.
  (CVE-2014-0099)

  It was found that the org.apache.catalina.servlets.DefaultServlet
  implementation in Apache Tomcat allowed the definition of XML External
  Entities (XXEs) in provided XSLTs. A malicious application could use this
  to circumvent intended security restrictions to disclose sensitive
  information. (CVE-2014-0096)

  The CVE-2014-0075 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  The tomcat6-lib-6.0.37-19_patch_04.ep6.el5 package, provided as a
  dependency of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1, included a build of
  commons-dbcp.jar that used an incorrect java package name, causing
  applications using this dependency to not function properly. With this
  update, the java package name has been corrected. (BZ#1101287)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated tomcat6 packages, which contain backported patches to correct these
  issues. The Red Hat JBoss Web Server process must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
