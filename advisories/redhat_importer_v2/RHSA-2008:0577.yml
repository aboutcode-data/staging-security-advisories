  - CVE-2008-1676
summary: |
  Updated rhpki-common packages that fix a security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Certificate System 7.2.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) is an enterprise software system designed
  to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.

  rhpki-common -- the Red Hat PKI Common Framework -- is required by the
  following four RHCS subsystems: the Red Hat Certificate Authority; the Red
  Hat Data Recovery Manager; the Red Hat Online Certificate Status Protocol
  Manager; and the Red Hat Token Key Service.

  A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Certificate System handled Extensions
  in the certificate signing requests (CSR). All requested Extensions were
  added to the issued certificate even if constraints were defined in the
  Certificate Authority (CA) profile. An attacker could submit a CSR for a
  subordinate CA certificate even if the CA configuration prohibited
  subordinate CA certificates. This lead to a bypass of the intended security
  policy, possibly simplifying man-in-the-middle attacks against users that
  trust Certificate Authorities managed by Red Hat Certificate System.
  (CVE-2008-1676)

  All users of Red Hat Certificate System 7.2 should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which resolves this issue.
