summary: "Updated packages for dvips are available which fix a vulnerability allowing\nprint\
  \ users to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n[Updated 13 Aug 2003]\nAdded tetex-doc package that\
  \ was originally left out of the errata.\n\nThe dvips utility converts DVI format into PostScript(TM),\
  \ and is used in\nRed Hat Linux as a print filter for printing DVI files. A vulnerability\n\
  has been found in dvips which uses the system() function insecurely when\nmanaging fonts.\n\
  \nSince dvips is used in a print filter, this allows local or remote\nattackers who have print\
  \ access to carefully craft a print job that allows\nthem to execute arbitrary code as the\
  \ user 'lp'. \n\nA work around for this vulnerability is to remove the print filter for DVI\n\
  files. The following commands, run as root, will accomplish this:\n\nrm -f /usr/share/printconf/mf_rules/mf40-tetex_filters\n\
  rm -f /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/dvi-to-ps.fpi\n\nHowever, to fix the problem in the dvips\
  \ utility as well as remove the\nprint filter we recommend that all users upgrade to the these\
  \ packages\ncontained within this erratum which contain a patch for this issue.\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ was discovered by Olaf Kirch of SuSE.\n\nAdditionally, the file /var/lib/texmf/ls-R had\
  \ world-writable permissions.\n\nThis issue is also fixed by the packages contained within\
  \ this erratum."
