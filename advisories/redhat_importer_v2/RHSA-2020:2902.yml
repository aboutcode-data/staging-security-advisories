  - CVE-2020-12865
summary: |
  An update for sane-backends is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) is a universal scanner interface. The SANE application programming interface (API) provides standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware (for example, flatbed scanners, hand-held scanners, video and still cameras, and frame-grabbers).

  Security Fix(es):

  * sane-backends: Heap buffer overflow in epsonds_net_read in epsonds-net.c (CVE-2020-12861)

  * sane-backends: Heap buffer overflow in esci2_img (CVE-2020-12865)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
