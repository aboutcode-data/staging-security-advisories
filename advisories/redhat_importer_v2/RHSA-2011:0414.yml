  - CVE-2011-1011
summary: |
  Updated policycoreutils packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The policycoreutils packages contain the core utilities that are
  required for the basic operation of a Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)
  system and its policies.

  It was discovered that the seunshare utility did not enforce proper file
  permissions on the directory used as an alternate temporary directory
  mounted as /tmp/. A local user could use this flaw to overwrite files or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or
  setgid application that relies on proper /tmp/ permissions, by running that
  application via seunshare. (CVE-2011-1011)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy for reporting this issue.

  This update also introduces the following changes:

  * The seunshare utility was moved from the main policycoreutils subpackage
  to the policycoreutils-sandbox subpackage. This utility is only required
  by the sandbox feature and does not need to be installed by default.

  * Updated selinux-policy packages that add the SELinux policy changes
  required by the seunshare fixes.

  All policycoreutils users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue.
