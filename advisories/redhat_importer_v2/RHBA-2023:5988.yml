  - CVE-2023-4863
summary: |
  An updated rhel9/firefox-flatpak container image is now available in the Red Hat container registry.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance, and portability.

  Flatpak is a system for running graphical applications as containers. Installing an application as a Flatpak rather than as an individual package allows it to be installed and updated independently of the host operating system.

  This updates the rhel9/firefox-flatpak image of Firefox in the Red Hat container registry.
