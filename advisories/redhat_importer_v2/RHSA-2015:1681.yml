  - CVE-2015-1856
summary: "Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this\
  \ update as having Moderate \nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\
  \ base \nscore, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the \nCVE link in\
  \ the References section.\n\nOpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual\n\
  containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary\ndata). The service's\
  \ distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;\nredundancy as failure-proofing is\
  \ provided through software-based data\nreplication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous\
  \ eventual\nconsistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center\ndeployment.\n\
  \nA flaw was found in openstack-swift where an authenticated user may \ndelete the most recent\
  \ version of a versioned object regardless of \nownership. To exploit this flaw an attacker\
  \ most know the name of the \nobject and have listing access to the x-versions-location container.\
  \ \n(CVE-2015-1856)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this\
  \ \nissue. Upstream acknowledges Clay Gerrard of SwiftStack as the \noriginal reporter.\n\n\
  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct\
  \ this issue. After installing this update, the\nOpenStack Object Storage services will be\
  \ restarted automatically."
