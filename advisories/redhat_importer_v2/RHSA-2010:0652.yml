  - CVE-2009-1882
summary: |
  Updated ImageMagick packages that fix one security issue and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
  System that can read and write multiple image formats.

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the ImageMagick routine responsible for creating X11 images. An
  attacker could create a specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a
  victim, would cause ImageMagick to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2009-1882)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * previously, portions of certain RGB images on the right side were not
  rendered and left black when converting or displaying them. With this
  update, RGB images display correctly. (BZ#625058)

  Users of ImageMagick are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  instances of ImageMagick must be restarted for this update to take effect.
