summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.3 that
  fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
  specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
  communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
  and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

  Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
  using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
  version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
  OpenSSL. Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform includes OpenSSL
  0.9.8e, so this flaw is only exploitable when OpenSSL in JBoss EAP is used
  as a client, communicating with a vulnerable server running OpenSSL version
  1.0.1 and above. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
  https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
  of this issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.3 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
