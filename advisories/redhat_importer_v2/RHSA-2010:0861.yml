summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  A race condition flaw was found in the way Firefox handled Document Object
  Model (DOM) element properties. Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox
  to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Firefox. (CVE-2010-3765)

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2010-3175, CVE-2010-3176, CVE-2010-3179, CVE-2010-3183,
  CVE-2010-3180)

  A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in Firefox converted text
  into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
  a victim running Firefox, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the
  context of the Gopher domain. (CVE-2010-3177)

  A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Firefox. An attacker could
  create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal
  private data from a different website the victim had loaded with Firefox.
  (CVE-2010-3178)

  A flaw was found in the script that launches Firefox. The LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
  to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
  Firefox, if that user ran Firefox from within an attacker-controlled
  directory. (CVE-2010-3182)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 3.6.11 and 3.6.12. You can find links to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 3.6.12, which corrects these issues. After installing the
  update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
