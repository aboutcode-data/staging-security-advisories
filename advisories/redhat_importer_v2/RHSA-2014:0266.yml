  - CVE-2014-0106
summary: |
  An updated sudo package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
  certain users the ability to run commands as root.

  A flaw was found in the way sudo handled its blacklist of environment
  variables. When the "env_reset" option was disabled, a user permitted to
  run certain commands via sudo could use this flaw to run such a command
  with one of the blacklisted environment variables set, allowing them to run
  an arbitrary command with the target user's privileges. (CVE-2014-0106)

  Note: This issue does not affect the default configuration of the sudo
  package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat would like to thank Todd C. Miller for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Sebastien Macke as the original reporter.

  All sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
