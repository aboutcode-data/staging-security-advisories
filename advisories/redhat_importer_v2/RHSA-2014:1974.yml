  - CVE-2013-6435
summary: |
  Updated rpm packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven package
  management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying,
  and updating software packages. Each software package consists of an
  archive of files along with information about the package such as its
  version, description, and other information.

  It was found that RPM wrote file contents to the target installation
  directory under a temporary name, and verified its cryptographic signature
  only after the temporary file has been written completely. Under certain
  conditions, the system interprets the unverified temporary file contents
  and extracts commands from it. This could allow an attacker to modify
  signed RPM files in such a way that they would execute code chosen by the
  attacker during package installation. (CVE-2013-6435)

  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

  All rpm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications
  linked against the RPM library must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
