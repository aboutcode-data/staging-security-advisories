  - CVE-2012-1569
summary: |
  Updated libtasn1 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  libtasn1 is a library developed for ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)
  structures management that includes DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules)
  encoding and decoding.

  A flaw was found in the way libtasn1 decoded DER data. An attacker could
  create carefully-crafted DER encoded input (such as an X.509 certificate)
  that, when parsed by an application that uses libtasn1 (such as
  applications using GnuTLS), could cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2012-1569)

  Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Hall of Mu Dynamics for reporting this
  issue.

  Users of libtasn1 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all applications linked to the libtasn1 library must be restarted,
  or the system rebooted.
