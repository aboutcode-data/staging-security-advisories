  - CVE-2015-8325
summary: |
  An update for openssh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the OpenSSH sshd daemon fetched PAM environment settings before running the login program. In configurations with UseLogin=yes and the pam_env PAM module configured to read user environment settings, a local user could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as root. (CVE-2015-8325)
