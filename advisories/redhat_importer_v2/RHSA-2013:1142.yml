summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1701)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird generated Certificate Request
  Message Format (CRMF) requests. An attacker could use this flaw to perform
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1710)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled the interaction between
  frames and browser history. An attacker could use this flaw to trick
  Thunderbird into treating malicious content as if it came from the browser
  history, allowing for XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1709)

  It was found that the same-origin policy could be bypassed due to the way
  Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) were checked in JavaScript. An attacker
  could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks, or install malicious add-ons
  from third-party pages. (CVE-2013-1713)

  It was found that web workers could bypass the same-origin policy. An
  attacker could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1714)

  It was found that, in certain circumstances, Thunderbird incorrectly
  handled Java applets. If a user launched an untrusted Java applet via
  Thunderbird, the applet could use this flaw to obtain read-only access to
  files on the user's local system. (CVE-2013-1717)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Jeff Gilbert, Henrik Skupin, moz_bug_r_a4, Cody
  Crews, Federico Lanusse, and Georgi Guninski as the original reporters of
  these issues.

  Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
  HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
  They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
  viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 17.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
  installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
  take effect.
