  - CVE-2011-4127
summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue and two
  bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  Using the SG_IO IOCTL to issue SCSI requests to partitions or LVM volumes
  resulted in the requests being passed to the underlying block device. If a
  privileged user only had access to a single partition or LVM volume, they
  could use this flaw to bypass those restrictions and gain read and write
  access (and be able to issue other SCSI commands) to the entire block
  device.

  In KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) environments using raw format virtio
  disks backed by a partition or LVM volume, a privileged guest user could
  bypass intended restrictions and issue read and write requests (and other
  SCSI commands) on the host, and possibly access the data of other guests
  that reside on the same underlying block device. Refer to Red Hat Bugzilla
  bug 752375 for further details and a mitigation script for users who cannot
  apply this update immediately. (CVE-2011-4127)

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2011-4539 (dhcp issue)

  CVE-2011-4339 (ipmitool issue)

  CVE-2011-1530 (krb5 issue)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Virtual LAN (VLAN) identifiers containing a space were accepted, even
  though they could not be configured correctly. With this update, VLAN
  identifiers containing a space are rejected with an "Invalid VLAN ID"
  message. (BZ#761537)

  * After configuring netconsole, it was not possible to start the service:
  the "service netconsole start" command failed with a warning that
  configfs.ko could not be found, and a fatal error that netconsole.ko could
  not be inserted. With this update, the netconsole service starts as
  expected. Note that after netconsole is configured, the service will not
  automatically start, even after rebooting. The service must be manually
  started. (BZ#765898)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
