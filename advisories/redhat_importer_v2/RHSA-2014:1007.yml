summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1 roll up patch 1 of 2014, which fixes two security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the
  management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss BRMS
  5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security issues are
  also fixed with this release:

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
