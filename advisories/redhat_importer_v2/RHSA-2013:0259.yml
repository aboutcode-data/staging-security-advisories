summary: |
  An updated apache-cxf package for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 that
  fixes two security issues is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4,
  5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light
  and rich Java applications.

  If web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor
  enabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these
  services were always granted access, without applying authentication
  checks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing
  REST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple
  SOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints
  applied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if
  WSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that
  use WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)

  It was found that Apache CXF was vulnerable to SOAPAction spoofing attacks
  under certain conditions. If web services were exposed via Apache CXF that
  use a unique SOAPAction for each service operation, then a remote attacker
  could perform SOAPAction spoofing to call a forbidden operation if it
  accepts the same parameters as an allowed operation. WS-Policy validation
  was performed against the operation being invoked, and an attack must pass
  validation to be successful. (CVE-2012-3451)

  Note that the CVE-2012-3451 and CVE-2012-5633 issues only affected
  environments that have JBoss Web Services CXF installed.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting
  CVE-2012-3451.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and
  configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package. The JBoss
  server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
