  - CVE-2015-0818
summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Two flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
  (CVE-2015-0817, CVE-2015-0818)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges ilxu1a and Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters
  of these issues.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 31.5.3 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
