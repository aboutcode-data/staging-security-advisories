  - CVE-2014-8564
summary: |
  Updated gnutls packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). The gnutls packages also
  include the libtasn1 library, which provides Abstract Syntax Notation One
  (ASN.1) parsing and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules
  (DER) encoding and decoding functions.

  An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed
  certain ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) certificates or certificate
  signing requests (CSR). A malicious user could create a specially crafted
  ECC certificate or a certificate signing request that, when processed by an
  application compiled against GnuTLS (for example, certtool), could cause
  that application to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user running the application. (CVE-2014-8564)

  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Sean Burford as the original reporter.

  All gnutls users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all applications linked to the GnuTLS or libtasn1 library must
  be restarted.
