  - CVE-2021-42574
summary: "An update for binutils is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 Extended\
  \ Update Support.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact\
  \ of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References\
  \ section.\n\nThe binutils packages provide a collection of binary utilities for the manipulation\
  \ of object code in various object file formats. It includes the ar, as, gprof, ld, nm, objcopy,\
  \ objdump, ranlib, readelf, size, strings, strip, and addr2line utilities.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\
  \n* Developer environment: Unicode's bidirectional (BiDi) override characters can cause trojan\
  \ source attacks (CVE-2021-42574)\n\nThe following changes were introduced in binutils in\
  \ order to facilitate detection of BiDi Unicode characters:\n\nTools which display names or\
  \ strings (readelf, strings, nm, objdump) have a new command line option --unicode / -U which\
  \ controls how Unicode characters are handled.\n\nUsing \"--unicode=default\" will treat them\
  \ as normal for the tool. This is the default behaviour when --unicode option is not used.\n\
  Using \"--unicode=locale\" will display them according to the current locale.\nUsing \"--unicode=hex\"\
  \ will display them as hex byte values.\nUsing \"--unicode=escape\" will display them as Unicode\
  \ escape sequences. \nUsing \"--unicode=highlight\" will display them as Unicode escape sequences\
  \ highlighted in red, if supported by the output device.\n\nFor more details about the security\
  \ issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information,\
  \ refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section."
