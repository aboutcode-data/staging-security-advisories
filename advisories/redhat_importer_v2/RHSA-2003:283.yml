  - CVE-2003-0694
summary: |
  Updated Sendmail packages that fix a potentially-exploitable vulnerability
  are now available.

  Sendmail is a widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA) and is included in all
  Red Hat Linux distributions.


  Michal Zalewski found a bug in the prescan() function of unpatched Sendmail
  versions prior to 8.12.10. The sucessful exploitation of this bug can lead
  to heap and stack structure overflows.  Although no exploit currently
  exists, this issue is locally exploitable and may also be remotely
  exploitable. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0694 to this issue.

  Additionally, for Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9 we have included a fix for a
  potential buffer overflow in ruleset parsing.  This problem is not
  exploitable in the default sendmail configuration; it is exploitable only
  if non-standard rulesets recipient (2), final (4), or mailer-specific
  envelope recipients rulesets are used.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0681 to
  this issue.

  All users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing a
  backported patch which corrects these vulnerabilities.
