summary: |
  An updated RealPlayer package that fixes a format string bug is now available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red Hat

  arbitrary code as the user running RealPlayer. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-2710

  which contains RealPlayer version 10.0.6 and is not vulnerable to this issue.
