  - CVE-2012-2313
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's dl2k driver, used by
  certain D-Link Gigabit Ethernet adapters, restricted IOCTLs. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to issue potentially harmful IOCTLs,
  which could cause Ethernet adapters using the dl2k driver to malfunction
  (for example, losing network connectivity). (CVE-2012-2313, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The QLogic netxen_nic driver has been upgraded to version 4.0.75, which
  provides several bug fixes. This update also allows users to set speed and
  automatic negotiation parameters for Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports. Note
  that QLogic devices do not support half-duplex data transmission at the
  moment. (BZ#865304)

  * When the ext3_dx_add_entry() function had to split a directory index
  node, it had to ensure that the name_len variable of the new dx_node's
  fake_dirent structure was set to zero. Otherwise, the e2fsck tool did not
  recognize it as an intermediate htree node and considered the htree node to
  be corrupted. The dx_node's fake_dirent structure is now always explicitly
  set to zero, which prevents the corruption in this scenario. (BZ#866548)

  * Previously, the error cleanup logic was incorrect: once an error was
  detected, the same error was reported on every polling cycle (the default
  behavior is to poll every second). This caused an excessive amount of Error
  Detection And Correction (EDAC) messages to be logged in the
  /var/log/messages file. This update fixes the error cleanup logic, which
  prevents the unnecessary messages from being logged. (BZ#866796)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
