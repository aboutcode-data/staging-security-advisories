summary: "Updated Mozilla packages that fix vulnerabilities in S/MIME parsing as well\nas other\
  \ issues and bugs are now available.\n\nMozilla is a Web browser and mail reader, designed\
  \ for standards\ncompliance, performance and portability.  Network Security Services (NSS)\n\
  is a set of libraries designed to support cross-platform development of\nsecurity-enabled\
  \ server applications. \n\nNISCC testing of implementations of the S/MIME protocol uncovered\
  \ a number\nof bugs in NSS versions prior to 3.9.   The parsing of unexpected ASN.1\nconstructs\
  \ within S/MIME data could cause Mozilla to crash or consume large\namounts of memory.  A\
  \ remote attacker could potentially trigger these bugs\nby sending a carefully-crafted S/MIME\
  \ message to a victim.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0564 to this issue. \n\nAndreas Sandblad discovered a cross-site\
  \ scripting issue that affects\nvarious versions of Mozilla.  When linking to a new page it\
  \ is still\npossible to interact with the old page before the new page has been\nsuccessfully\
  \ loaded. Any Javascript events will be invoked in the context\nof the new page, making cross-site\
  \ scripting possible if the different\npages belong to different domains.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0191 to\nthis issue.\
  \ \n\nFlaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web\nbrowsers\
  \ and servers. The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server\nsupplying a cookie to a client\
  \ to specify a subset of URLs on the origin\nserver to which the cookie applies. Web servers\
  \ such as Apache do not\nfilter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send\
  \ back\ncookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.\nHowever,\
  \ by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character\nencoding, it is possible\
  \ to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a\npath outside of the originally-specified\
  \ subset.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name\nCAN-2003-0594 to this issue. \n\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ updated packages, which\ncontain Mozilla version 1.4.2 and are not vulnerable to these issues."
