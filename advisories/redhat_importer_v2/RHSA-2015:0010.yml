  - CVE-2014-3566
summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 that
  provides a patch to mitigate the CVE-2014-3566 issue is now available from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java
  applications, which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss
  Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

  This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
  (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
  attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
  protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
  supported protocol version fails.

  This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
  The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
  attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
  This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
  POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
  update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
  require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

  For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
  at https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
