  - CVE-2016-7050
summary: |
  An update for resteasy-base is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  RESTEasy contains a JBoss project that provides frameworks to help build RESTful Web Services and RESTful Java applications. It is a fully certified and portable implementation of the JAX-RS specification.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that under certain conditions RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with SerializableProvider, resulting in deserialization of potentially untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy. (CVE-2016-7050)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mikhail Egorov (Odin) for reporting this issue.
