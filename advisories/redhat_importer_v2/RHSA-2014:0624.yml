  - CVE-2014-0224
summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
  specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
  communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
  and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

  Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
  using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
  version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
  OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
  https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
  of this issue.

  All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
  SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.
