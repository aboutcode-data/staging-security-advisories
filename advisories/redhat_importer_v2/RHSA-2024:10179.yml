summary: "Multicluster Engine for Kubernetes 2.3.8 General Availability release images, \nwhich\
  \ fix bugs and update container images.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update\
  \ as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\
  \ score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from\
  \ the CVE links in the References section.\n\nMulticluster Engine for Kubernetes 2.3.8 images\n\
  \nMulticluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components\nthat are necessary\
  \ for the centralized management of multiple\nKubernetes-based clusters across data centers,\
  \ public clouds, and private\nclouds.\n\nYou can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift\
  \ Container Platform\nclusters or to bring existing Kubernetes-based clusters under management\
  \ by\nimporting them. After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that\nare provided\
  \ by the engine to distribute configuration based on placement\npolicy.\n\nSecurity fix(es):\n\
  nodejs/elliptic: EDDSA signature malleability occurs because there is a missing signature\
  \ length check, and thus zero-valued bytes can be removed or appended (CVE-2024-42459)\nnodejs/elliptic:\
  \ ECDSA signature malleability occurs because there is a missing check for whether the leading\
  \ bit of r and s is zero (CVE-2024-42460) \nnodejs/elliptic: ECDSA implementation malleability\
  \ due to BER-enconded signatures being allowed (CVE-2024-42461) \nMissing Validation in Elliptic's\
  \ EDDSA Signature Verification (CVE-2024-48949)"
