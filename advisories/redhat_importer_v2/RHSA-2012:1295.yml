  - CVE-2011-4605
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0.CP05 and 4.3.0.CP05 that
  fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality. The Java Naming and Directory
  Interface (JNDI) Java API allows Java software clients to locate objects or
  services in an application server.

  It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote
  write access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to
  access the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,
  delete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,
  application-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting this
  issue.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0.CP05 and 4.3.0.CP05 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
