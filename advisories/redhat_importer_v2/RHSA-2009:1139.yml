  - CVE-2009-1889
summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously. The AOL
  Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime (OSCAR) protocol is used by the
  AOL ICQ and AIM instant messaging systems.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Pidgin OSCAR protocol
  implementation. If a remote ICQ user sent a web message to a local Pidgin
  user using this protocol, it would cause excessive memory usage, leading to
  a denial of service (Pidgin crash). (CVE-2009-1889)

  These updated packages also fix the following bug:

  * the Yahoo! Messenger Protocol changed, making it incompatible (and
  unusable) with Pidgin versions prior to 2.5.7. This update provides Pidgin
  2.5.8, which implements version 16 of the Yahoo! Messenger Protocol, which
  resolves this issue.

  Note: These packages upgrade Pidgin to version 2.5.8. Refer to the Pidgin
  release notes for a full list of changes:
  http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. Pidgin must be restarted for this update to take effect.
