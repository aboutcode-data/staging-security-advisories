  - CVE-2014-3691
summary: "Updated the following packages to fix several bugs in Red Hat Satellite 6: \n\nforeman\n\
  foreman-proxy\nkatello-agent\npulp\npulp-nodes\npulp-puppet\npulp-rpm\nruby193-rubygem-fog\n\
  ruby193-rubygem-foreman-tasks\n\npackages. These packages are now available in Red Hat Satellite\
  \ 6.\n\nRed Hat Satellite is a system management solution that allows organizations to\nconfigure\
  \ and maintain their systems without the necessity to provide public\nInternet access to their\
  \ servers or other client systems. It performs\nprovisioning and configuration management\
  \ of predefined standard operating\nenvironments.\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\
  *BZ1107690 When cloud_init attempts to contact Foreman to complete the\nphone_home action,\
  \ it fails with a HTTP 500 error due to incorrect data being\ntransmitted in the POST header.\
  \ To rectify this error, post settings are now\nbeing cleared when attempting to complete\
  \ the phone_home action.\n\n*BZ1119910 katello-installer fails to execute when the host system\
  \ has\nrestrictive umasks. The restrictive umasks affects permissions and access to the\n\
  keystore and certain cert files. This fix will set the umask to the required\nvalue for installation\
  \ to make sure that the installation goes through properly.\n\n*BZ1128296 When synchronizing\
  \ content, the User Interface fails to complete the\nsynchronization process and hangs indefinitely,\
  \ despite the pulp logs\nregistering errors. This error was caused by an incomplete URL. All\
  \ URL\nparameters must contain the full address and requires the \"http\" or \"https\"\nprotocol.\
  \ Pre-validation checks have been implemented to check the proxy URL and\nprovide an error\
  \ message should the proxy URL fail to comply with the\nrequirements.\n\n*BZ1139152 katello-remove\
  \ fails to remove the ruby193-rubygem-foreman-tasks\npackage on a RHEL 7 system because of\
  \ preun script errors related to turning off\nservices. The preun script used the chkconfig\
  \ command to turn off tasks which is\nnot compatible with RHEL 7. This fix corrects the preun\
  \ script to include the\ncorrect commands for different RHEL versions. katello-remove should\
  \ correctly\nremove the package.\n\n*BZ1142861 When provisioning a VMWare virtual machine\
  \ that is in a cluster in a\nfolder, the provisioning process fails with the error \"Failed\
  \ to create a\ncompute VMWare (VMWare) instance client.example.com: cluster is required for\n\
  this operation\". Red Hat Satellite could not detect clusters within folders.\nThis fix adds\
  \ support for clusters located below folders as well as VMWare\nmachine setups in a non-clustered\
  \ environment.\n\n*BZ1152720 Foreman Smart Proxy failed to verify SSL certificates. This permits\n\
  any client with access to the API to make requests and perform actions. Foreman\nSmart Proxy\
  \ now runs a check on SSL certificates to verify identity, forbidding\nHTTPS requests when\
  \ there is no client SSL certificate.\n\n*BZ1159327 On a Satellite server using an http proxy\
  \ connection, selecting\nrepositories fails with an SSL_connect error. Some proxy servers\
  \ do not support\nSSLv23 and TLS 1.2 which Red Hat Satellite requires. To fix this issue,\n\
  Satellite now allows the administrator to specify a SSL version via the\n/etc/foreman/plugins/katello.yaml.\n\
  \n*BZ1165301 When executing a daily sync plan, the synchronization process freezes\nwith \"\
  Sync Incomplete\" resulting in pulp errors in the log file. The error\noccurs when the downloaded\
  \ packages are\nbeing verified wherein the checksum_type is being reported as SHA while pulp\n\
  explicitly handles SHA1. To fix this issue, the verification process returns the\n\"SHA\"\
  \ value to \"SHA1\" to comply with pulp requirements.\n\n*BZ1168010 On a RHEL 7 system, ruby\
  \ upgrades changed the accepted format for\nio.popen resulting in ssh puppet commands being\
  \ incorrectly formatted. This\nprevented the commands from executing. The format has been\
  \ corrected in this\nfix.\n\n*BZ1173228 RHEV/ovirt instances with non self-signed server certificates\
  \ could\nnot connect to the Satellite server. To fix this issue, the CA field has been\nchanged\
  \ to an editable field so that administrators can provide the correct CA\nor CA chain in the\
  \ correct order.\n\nAll Red Hat Satellite 6 users are advised to upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages\nto resolve the bugs above."
