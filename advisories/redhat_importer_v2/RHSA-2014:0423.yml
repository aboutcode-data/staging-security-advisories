  - CVE-2014-0188
summary: |
  Updated openshift-origin-broker and
  rubygem-openshift-origin-auth-remote-user packages that fix one security
  issue are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openshift-origin-broker package provides the OpenShift Broker service
  that manages all user logins, DNS name resolution, application states, and
  general orchestration of the applications.

  The rubygem-openshift-origin-auth-remote-user package provides the remote
  user authentication plug-in.

  A flaw was found in the way openshift-origin-broker handled authentication
  requests via the remote user authentication plug-in. A remote attacker able
  to submit a request to openshift-origin-broker could set the X-Remote-User
  header, and send the request to a passthrough trigger, resulting in a
  bypass of the authentication checks to gain access to any OpenShift user
  account on the system. (CVE-2014-0188)

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.5 are advised to upgrade to
  these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this
  issue. After installing the updated packages, restart the httpd daemon for
  this update to take effect.
