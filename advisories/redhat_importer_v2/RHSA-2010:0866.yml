  - CVE-2010-2941
summary: |
  Updated cups packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
  for UNIX operating systems.

  An invalid free flaw was found in the way the CUPS server parsed Internet
  Printing Protocol (IPP) packets. A malicious user able to send IPP requests
  to the CUPS server could use this flaw to crash the CUPS server.
  (CVE-2010-2941)

  Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NATO C3 Agency for
  reporting this issue.

  Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
  update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.
