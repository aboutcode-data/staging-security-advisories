summary: "Updated OpenSSL packages are available which fix several serious buffer\noverflow\
  \ vulnerabilities.\n\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit\
  \ which\nimplements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS\
  \ v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library. A security\
  \ audit of the OpenSSL code sponsored by\nDARPA found several buffer overflows in OpenSSL\
  \ which affect versions 0.9.7\nand 0.9.6d and earlier:\n\n1. The master key supplied by a\
  \ client to an SSL version 2 server could be\noversized, causing a stack-based buffer overflow.\
  \ This issue is remotely\nexploitable. Services that have SSLv2 disabled would not be vulnerable\
  \ to\nthis issue. (CAN-2002-0656)\n\n2. The SSLv3 session ID supplied to a client from a malicious\
  \ server could\nbe oversized and overrun a buffer. This issue looks to be remotely\nexploitable.\
  \ (CAN-2002-0656)\n\n3. Various buffers used for storing ASCII representations of integers\
  \ were\ntoo small on 64 bit platforms. This issue may be exploitable. (CAN-2002-0655)\n\n\
  A further issue was found in OpenSSL 0.9.7 that does not affect versions of\nOpenSSL shipped\
  \ with Red Hat Linux (CAN-2002-0657).\n\nA large number of applications within Red Hat Linux\
  \ make use the OpenSSL\nlibrary to provide SSL support.  All users are therefore advised to\
  \ upgrade\nto the errata OpenSSL packages, which contain patches to correct these\nvulnerabilities.\n\
  \nNOTE: \n\nPlease read the Solution section below as it contains instructions for\nmaking\
  \ sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted after the update\nis applied.\n\nThanks\
  \ go to the OpenSSL team and Ben Laurie for providing patches for\nthese issues."
