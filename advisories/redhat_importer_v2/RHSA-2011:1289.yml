  - CVE-2011-3146
summary: |
  Updated librsvg2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The librsvg2 packages provide an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) library
  based on libart.

  A flaw was found in the way librsvg2 parsed certain SVG files. An attacker
  could create a specially-crafted SVG file that, when opened, would cause
  applications that use librsvg2 (such as Eye of GNOME) to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3146)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ubuntu Security Team for reporting this
  issue. The Ubuntu Security Team acknowledges Sauli Pahlman as the original
  reporter.

  All librsvg2 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications that use
  librsvg2 must be restarted for this update to take effect.
