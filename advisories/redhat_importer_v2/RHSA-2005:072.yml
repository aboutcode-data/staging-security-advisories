  - CVE-2005-0077
summary: "An updated perl-DBI package that fixes a temporary file flaw in\nDBI::ProxyServer\
  \ is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nDBI is a database access\
  \ Application Programming Interface (API) for\nthe Perl programming language. \n\nThe Debian\
  \ Security Audit Project discovered that the DBI library creates a\ntemporary PID file in\
  \ an insecure manner.  A local user could overwrite or\ncreate files as a different user who\
  \ happens to run an application which\nuses DBI::ProxyServer.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0077 to this issue.\
  \ \n\nUsers should update to this erratum package which disables the temporary\nPID file unless\
  \ configured."
