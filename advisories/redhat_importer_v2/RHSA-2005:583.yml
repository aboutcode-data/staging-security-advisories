  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having low security impact by\
  \ the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nDump examines files in a file system, determines\
  \ which ones need to be\nbacked up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape, or other\n\
  storage medium.\n\nA flaw was found with dump file locking.  A malicious local user could\
  \ \nmanipulate the file lock in such a way as to prevent dump from running.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-1914 to this issue.\n\n\
  Users of dump should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch to resolve\
  \ this issue."
