summary: "Updated SANE packages that resolve a number of vulnerabilities with the\nsaned daemon\
  \ are now available.\n\nSANE is a package for using document scanners.\n\nSane includes a\
  \ daemon program (called saned) that enables a single machine\nconnected to a scanner to be\
  \ used remotely.  This program contains several\nvulnerabilities.\n\nNOTE: Although the SANE\
  \ packages include this program, it is not used by\ndefault under Red Hat Linux.\n\nThe IP\
  \ address of the remote host is only checked after the first\ncommunication occurs, causing\
  \ saned.conf restrictions to be ineffective for\nthe first communication.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0773 to this issue.\n\
  \nA connection that is dropped early causes one of several problems.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2003-0774, CAN-2003-0775,\
  \ and CAN-2003-0777 to these issues.\n\nLack of error checking can cause various other unfavorable\
  \ consequences. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned\
  \ the names CAN-2003-0776 and CAN-2003-0778 to these issues.\n\nAdditionally, the updated\
  \ packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0 include a fix for\na bug that could cause hardware damage\
  \ to Epson 1260 scanners.  Releases\nprior to Red Hat Linux 8.0 are unaffected by this issue.\
  \  Red Hat Linux 9\nis affected by this, but will be covered by a separate advisory.\n\nUsers\
  \ of SANE (particularly those that use saned for remote scanner access)\nshould upgrade to\
  \ these errata packages, which resolve these issues."
