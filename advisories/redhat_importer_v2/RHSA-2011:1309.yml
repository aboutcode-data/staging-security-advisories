  - CVE-2011-1483
summary: |
  Updated jbossas packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2.0.CP09 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market-leading platform for
  innovative and scalable Java applications. JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam into a complete and simple enterprise solution. JBoss Web
  Services Native is a web service framework included as part of JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform. It implements the JAX-WS specification.

  It was found that JBoss Web Services Native did not properly protect
  against recursive entity resolution when processing Document Type
  Definitions (DTD). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a
  specially-crafted HTTP POST request to a deployed web service, causing
  excessive CPU and memory consumption on the system hosting that service. If
  the attack is repeated to consume all available network sockets, the server
  will become unavailable. (CVE-2011-1483)

  Warning: Before applying this update, please back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2.0.CP09 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct this issue. The JBoss server process must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
