  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that
  provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss
  Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  It was discovered that the JBoss Operations Network server did not
  correctly restrict access to certain remote APIs. A remote, unauthenticated
  attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary Java methods via
  ServerInvokerServlet or SchedulerService, and possibly exhaust all
  available disk space via ContentManager. (CVE-2015-0297)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alessandro Cavaliere for reporting this issue.

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat
