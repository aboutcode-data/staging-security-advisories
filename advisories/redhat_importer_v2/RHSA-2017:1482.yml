  - CVE-2017-1000364
  - CVE-2017-1000379
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Extended Lifecycle Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way memory was being allocated on the stack for user space binaries. If heap (or different memory region) and stack memory regions were adjacent to each other, an attacker could use this flaw to jump over the stack guard gap, cause controlled memory corruption on process stack or the adjacent memory region, and thus increase their privileges on the system. This is a kernel-side mitigation which increases the stack guard gap size from one page to 1 MiB to make successful exploitation of this issue more difficult. (CVE-2017-1000364, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qualys Research Labs for reporting this issue.
