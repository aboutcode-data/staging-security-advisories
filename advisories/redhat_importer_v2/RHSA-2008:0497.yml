  - CVE-2008-1951
summary: |
  Updated sblim packages that resolve a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SBLIM stands for Standards-Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability.
  It consists of a set of standards-based, Web-Based Enterprise Management
  (WBEM) modules that use the Common Information Model (CIM) standard to
  gather and provide systems management information, events, and methods to
  local or networked consumers via a CIM object services broker using the
  CMPI (Common Manageability Programming Interface) standard. This package
  provides a set of core providers and development tools for systems
  management applications.

  It was discovered that certain sblim libraries had an RPATH (runtime
  library search path) set in the ELF (Executable and Linking Format) header.
  This RPATH pointed to a sub-directory of a world-writable, temporary
  directory. A local user could create a file with the same name as a library
  required by sblim (such as libc.so) and place it in the directory defined
  in the RPATH. This file could then execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running an application that used sblim (eg
  tog-pegasus). (CVE-2008-1951)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated sblim packages, which resolve
  this issue.
