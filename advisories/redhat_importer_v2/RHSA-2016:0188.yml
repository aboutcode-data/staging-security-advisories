  - CVE-2015-7529
summary: |
  An updated sos package that fixes one security issue and one bug is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The sos package contains a set of utilities that gather information from
  system hardware, logs, and configuration files. The information can then be
  used for diagnostic purposes and debugging.

  An insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the way sos created
  certain sosreport files. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  perform a symbolic link attack to reveal the contents of sosreport files,
  or in some cases modify arbitrary files and escalate their privileges on
  the system. (CVE-2015-7529)

  This issue was discovered by Mateusz Guzik of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, the sosreport tool was not collecting the /var/lib/ceph and
  /var/run/ceph directories when run with the ceph plug-in enabled, causing
  the generated sosreport archive to miss vital troubleshooting information
  about ceph. With this update, the ceph plug-in for sosreport collects these
  directories, and the generated report contains more useful information.
  (BZ#1291347)

  All users of sos are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
