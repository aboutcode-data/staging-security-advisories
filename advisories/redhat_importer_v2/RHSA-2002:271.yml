summary: |
  A vulnerability in Pine version 4.44 and earlier releases can cause
  Pine to crash when sent a carefully crafted email.

  [Updated 06 Feb 2003]
  Added fixed packages for Advanced Workstation 2.1

  Pine, developed at the University of Washington, is a tool for reading,
  sending, and managing electronic messages (including mail and news).

  A security problem was found in versions of Pine 4.44 and earlier. In these
  verions, Pine does not allocate enough memory for the parsing and escaping
  of the "From" header, allowing a carefully crafted email to cause a
  buffer overflow on the heap.  This will result in Pine crashing.

  All users of Pine on Red Hat Linux Advanced Server are advised to
  update to these errata packages containing a patch to version 4.44
  of Pine that fixes this vulnerability.
