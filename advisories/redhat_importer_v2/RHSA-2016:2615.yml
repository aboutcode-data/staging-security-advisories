  - CVE-2016-8864
summary: |
  An update for bind is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND handled responses containing a DNAME answer. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named exit unexpectedly with an assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS response. (CVE-2016-8864)

  Red Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Tony Finch (University of Cambridge) and Marco Davids (SIDN Labs) as the original reporters.
