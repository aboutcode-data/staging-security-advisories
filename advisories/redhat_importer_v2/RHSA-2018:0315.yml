  - CVE-2017-12440
summary: |
  An update for openstack-aodh is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  openstack-aodh provides the ability to trigger actions based on defined rules against metric or event data collected by OpenStack Telemetry (ceilometer) or Time-Series-Database-as-a-Service (gnocchi).

  openstack-aodh has been rebased to the upstream 4.0.2-3 version.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A verification flaw was found in openstack-aodh. As part of an HTTP alarm action, a user could pass in a trust ID. However, the trust could be from anyone because it was not verified. Because the trust was then used by openstack-aodh to obtain a keystone token for the alarm action, a malicious user could pass in another person's trust ID and obtain a keystone token containing the delegated authority of that user. (CVE-2017-12440)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Zane Bitter (Red Hat) as the original reporter.
