summary: |
  Updated container images that fix various bugs are now available for Red Hat Openshift Container Storage 4.6.2 from Red Hat Container Registry.

  Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage is software-defined storage integrated with and optimized for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage is a highly scalable, production-grade persistent storage for stateful applications running in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. In addition to persistent storage, Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage provisions a multicloud data management service with an S3 compatible API.

  This advisory fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, there was a race condition with the Red Hat Ceph Storage PG
  autoscaler that caused the creation of 128 PGs instead of the default 32.
  This meant RGW pods would fail to come up. With this update, RGW pods would be able to start also in small clusters.
  (BZ#1914979)

  * Previously, the OSD design had one blocking PodDistributionBudget (PDB) for each OSD. This meant users could only drain one node at a time. OSDs have been redesigned to have one OSD PDB at the beginning which allows only one OSD to go down at a time. Once the OSD goes down, its failure domain is determined, and blocking OSD PDBs are created for other failure domains. The originally created OSD is then deleted, and all of the OSDs can go down in the failure domain. With this new design, multiple nodes can be drained in the same failure domain. (BZ#1916585)

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage are advised to pull these new images from the Red Hat Container Registry.
