  - CVE-2012-3546
summary: |
  Updated tomcat5 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container.

  It was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with
  another component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to
  FormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was
  possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator
  by appending "/j_security_check" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker
  with an authenticated session on an affected application could use this
  flaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not
  permitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.
  (CVE-2012-3546)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.
