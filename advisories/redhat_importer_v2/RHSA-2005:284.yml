summary: "Updated kernel packages are now available as part of ongoing support and\nmaintenance\
  \ of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 2.1 for 64-bit\narchitectures. This is the seventh regular\
  \ update.\n\nThis security advisory has been rated as having important security impact\nby\
  \ the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the\
  \ operating system.\n\nThis is the seventh regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux\
  \ 2.1.\n\nThe following security updates were made:\n\nA flaw in fragment queuing was discovered\
  \ that affected the Linux 2.4 and\nLinux 2.6 kernel netfilter subsystem. On systems configured\
  \ to filter or\nprocess network packets (for example, those configured to do firewalling),\n\
  a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted set of fragmented packets\nto a machine and\
  \ cause a denial of service (system crash). In order to\nsucessfully exploit this flaw, the\
  \ attacker would need to know (or guess)\nsome aspects of the firewall ruleset in place on\
  \ the target system to be\nable to craft the right fragmented packets. (CAN-2005-0449)\n\n\
  A flaw was discovered in the Linux PPP driver. On systems allowing remote\nusers to connect\
  \ to a server using ppp, a remote client could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash).\
  \ (CAN-2005-0384)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the bluetooth driver system. On systems where\
  \ the\nbluetooth modules are loaded, a local user could use this flaw to gain\nelevated (root)\
  \ privileges. (CAN-2005-0750)\n\nKeith Owens reported a flaw in the Itanium unw_unwind_to_user()\
  \ function.\nA local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash).\
  \ (CAN-2005-0135)\n\nA missing Itanium syscall table entry could allow an unprivileged\nlocal\
  \ user to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0137)\n\nThere were several\
  \ bug fixes in various parts of the kernel. The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems\
  \ has resulted in a marked improvement\nin the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 2.1.\n\nBug fixes for this release include:\n\n  - Fixes an incorrect test in RPC\
  \ for SYN packets when reconnecting \n    an idle TCP link\n  - Fixes a memory-corruption\
  \ bug in the DMA path that can cause\n    system hangs or unpredictable behavior under heavy\
  \ I/O load\n  - Adds new devices to the SCSI scan list so they can\n    be initialized and\
  \ handled properly: LSI ProFibre 4000R, HP \n    HSV200/210, HP MSA, STK OPENstorage D178.\n\
  \  - Fixes a hang under heavy I/O load in the qla1280 driver\n  - Fixes a panic in disk quota\
  \ code\n  - Fixes a potential format overflow in /proc/partitions\n  - Fixes ipvs calls to\
  \ ip_defrag()\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels\
  \ to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed\
  \ in this erratum.\n\nPlease note that a vulnerability addressed by this update (CAN-2005-0449)\n\
  required a change to the kernel module ABI which could cause third party\nmodules to not work.\
  \ However, Red Hat is currently not aware of any module\nthat would be affected by this change."
