  - CVE-2013-1896
summary: |
  An update for the Apache HTTP Server component of Red Hat JBoss Web Server
  2.0.1 that fixes two security issues is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, Solaris, and
  Microsoft Windows.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
  handled merge requests. An attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted
  merge request that contains URIs that are not configured for DAV, causing
  the httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2013-1896)

  It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from
  its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive,
  a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject
  terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed
  the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command
  execution with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-1862)

  Note: CVE-2013-1862 affects mod_rewrite. In the process of testing this
  patch, it was found that enabling mod_rewrite on 64-bit versions of Windows
  Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 running Red Hat JBoss Web Server
  2.0.1 could cause an httpd thread to crash, and the httpd process to
  restart. This bug is present in the GA release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server
  2.0.1, and is not a regression introduced by this patch. This bug may be
  resolved in a future update to JBoss Web Server 2.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
