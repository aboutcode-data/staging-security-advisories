summary: |
  An updated logrotate package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The logrotate utility simplifies the administration of multiple log files,
  allowing the automatic rotation, compression, removal, and mailing of log
  files.

  A shell command injection flaw was found in the way logrotate handled the
  shred directive. A specially-crafted log file could cause logrotate to
  execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running
  logrotate (root, by default). Note: The shred directive is not enabled by
  default. (CVE-2011-1154)

  A race condition flaw was found in the way logrotate applied permissions
  when creating new log files. In some specific configurations, a local
  attacker could use this flaw to open new log files before logrotate applies
  the final permissions, possibly leading to the disclosure of sensitive
  information. (CVE-2011-1098)

  An input sanitization flaw was found in logrotate. A log file with a
  specially-crafted file name could cause logrotate to abort when attempting
  to process that file a subsequent time. (CVE-2011-1155)

  All logrotate users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to resolve these issues.
