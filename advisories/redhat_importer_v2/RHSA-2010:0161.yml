summary: "Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and several\nbugs are\
  \ now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has\
  \ rated this update as having\nimportant security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System\
  \ (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability\
  \ from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nThe kernel-rt packages contain the Linux\
  \ kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security\
  \ issues:\n\n* a deficiency was found in the fasync_helper() implementation. This could\n\
  allow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a use-after-free of locked,\nasynchronous file\
  \ descriptors to cause a denial of service or privilege\nescalation. (CVE-2009-4141, Important)\n\
  \n* multiple flaws were found in the mmap and mremap implementations. A\nlocal, unprivileged\
  \ user could use these flaws to cause a local denial of\nservice or escalate their privileges.\
  \ (CVE-2010-0291, Important)\n\n* a missing boundary check was found in the do_move_pages()\
  \ function in the\nmemory migration functionality. A local user could use this flaw to cause\
  \ a\nlocal denial of service or an information leak. (CVE-2010-0415, Important)\n\n* a NULL\
  \ pointer dereference flaw was found in the ip6_dst_lookup_tail()\nfunction. An attacker on\
  \ the local network could trigger this flaw by\nsending IPv6 traffic to a target system, leading\
  \ to a system crash (kernel\nOOPS) if dst->neighbour is NULL on the target system when receiving\
  \ an IPv6\npacket. (CVE-2010-0437, Important)\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found\
  \ in the Fast Userspace Mutexes\n(futexes) implementation. The unlock code path did not check\
  \ if the futex\nvalue associated with pi_state->owner had been modified. A local user could\n\
  use this flaw to modify the futex value, possibly leading to a denial of\nservice or privilege\
  \ escalation when the pi_state->owner pointer is\ndereferenced. (CVE-2010-0622, Important)\n\
  \n* an information leak was found in the print_fatal_signal() implementation.\nWhen \"/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals\"\
  \ is set to 1 (the default value\nis 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be leaked\
  \ to\nuser-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note that this\nflaw only\
  \ affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003, Moderate)\n\n* a flaw was found in the kernel\
  \ connector implementation. A local,\nunprivileged user could trigger this flaw by sending\
  \ an arbitrary amount of\nnotification requests using specially-crafted netlink messages,\
  \ resulting\nin a denial of service. (CVE-2010-0410, Moderate)\n\n* missing capability checks\
  \ were found in the ebtables implementation, used\nfor creating an Ethernet bridge firewall.\
  \ This could allow a local,\nunprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions\
  \ and modify\nebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)\n\nThis update also fixes the following\
  \ bugs:\n\n* references were missing for two LSI MegaRAID SAS controllers already\nsupported\
  \ by the kernel, preventing systems using these controllers from\nbooting. (BZ#554664)\n\n\
  * a typo in the fix for CVE-2009-2691 resulted in gdb being unable to read\ncore files created\
  \ by gcore. (BZ#554965) \n\n* values for certain pointers used by the kernel, which should\
  \ be\nundereferencable, could potentially be abused when a kernel OOPS occurs.\nValues that\
  \ are harder to dereference are now used. (BZ#555227)\n\n* this update redesigns the locking\
  \ scheme of the TTY process group\n(tty->pgrp) structure, due to race conditions introduced\
  \ when tty->pgrp\nstarted using struct pid instead of pid_t. (BZ#559101)\n\n* the way the\
  \ NFS kernel server used iget() and the way in which it kept\nits cache of inode information,\
  \ could have led to (mainly on busy file\nservers) inconsistencies between the local file\
  \ system and the file system\nbeing served to clients. (BZ#561275)\n\nUsers should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The\
  \ system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect."
