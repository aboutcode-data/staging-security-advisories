  - CVE-2017-2614
summary: |
  An update for ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-jdbc is now available for RHEV Engine version 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  AAA-JDBC is an extension which allows to store authentication and authorization data in relational database and provides these data using standardized oVirt AAA API similarly to already existing AAA-LDAP extension.

  Security Fix(es):

  * When updating a password in the rhvm database the ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool tools fail to correctly check for the current password if it is expired. This would allow access to an attacker with access to change the password on accounts with expired passwords, gaining access to those accounts. (CVE-2017-2614)

  This issue was discovered by Dominic Geevarghes (Red Hat).
