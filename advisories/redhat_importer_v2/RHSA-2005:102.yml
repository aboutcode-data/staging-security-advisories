  - CVE-2005-0201
summary: |
  Updated dbus packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  D-BUS is a system for sending messages between applications. It is
  used both for the systemwide message bus service, and as a
  per-user-login-session messaging facility.

  Dan Reed discovered that a user can send and listen to messages on another
  user's per-user session bus if they know the address of the socket. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2005-0201 to this issue.  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, the
  per-user session bus is only used for printing notifications,  therefore
  this issue would only allow a local user to examine or send additional
  print notification messages.

  Users of dbus are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct this issue.
