  - CVE-2010-3906
summary: |
  Updated git packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system.

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in gitweb, a simple web
  interface for Git repositories. A remote attacker could perform an XSS
  attack against victims by tricking them into visiting a specially-crafted
  gitweb URL. (CVE-2010-3906)

  All gitweb users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
