  - CVE-2010-3081
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * The compat_alloc_user_space() function in the Linux kernel 32/64-bit
  compatibility layer implementation was missing sanity checks. This function
  could be abused in other areas of the Linux kernel if its length argument
  can be controlled from user-space. On 64-bit systems, a local, unprivileged
  user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-3081,
  Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hawkes for reporting this issue.

  Refer to Knowledgebase article DOC-40265 for further details:
  https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-40265

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported
  patch to correct this issue. The system must be rebooted for this update to
  take effect.
