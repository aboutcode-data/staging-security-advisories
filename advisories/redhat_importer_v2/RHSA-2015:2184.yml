  - CVE-2015-2704
summary: |
  Updated realmd packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The realmd DBus system service manages discovery of and enrollment in
  realms and domains, such as Active Directory or Identity Management (IdM).
  The realmd service detects available domains, automatically configures the
  system, and joins it as an account to a domain.

  A flaw was found in the way realmd parsed certain input when writing
  configuration into the sssd.conf or smb.conf file. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to inject arbitrary configurations into these files via a
  newline character in an LDAP response. (CVE-2015-2704)

  It was found that the realm client would try to automatically join an
  active directory domain without authentication, which could potentially
  lead to privilege escalation within a specified domain. (BZ#1205751)

  The realmd packages have been upgraded to upstream version 0.16.1, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#1174911)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Joining a Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine to a domain using the realm
  utility creates /home/domainname/[username]/ directories for domain users.
  Previously, SELinux labeled the domain users' directories incorrectly. As a
  consequence, the domain users sometimes experienced problems with SELinux
  policy. This update modifies the realmd service default behavior so that
  the domain users' directories are compatible with the standard SELinux
  policy. (BZ#1241832)

  * Previously, the realm utility was unable to join or discover domains with
  domain names containing underscore (_). The realmd service has been
  modified to process underscores in domain names correctly, which fixes the
  described bug. (BZ#1243771)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * The realmd utility now allows the user to disable automatic ID mapping
  from the command line. To disable the mapping, pass the
  "--automatic-id-mapping=no" option to the realmd utility. (BZ#1230941)

  All realmd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements.
