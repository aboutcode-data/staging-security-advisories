  - CVE-2014-8126
summary: |
  Updated condor packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  HTCondor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive
  jobs. It provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority
  scheme, and resource monitoring and management.

  The HTCondor scheduler can optionally notify a user of completed jobs by
  sending an email. Due to the way the daemon sent the email message,
  authenticated users able to submit jobs could execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the condor user. (CVE-2014-8126)

  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

  All Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5 users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
  HTCondor must be restarted for the update to take effect.
