  - CVE-2003-0041
summary: |
  Updated packages fix a vulnerability found in the Kerberos ftp client
  distributed with the Red Hat Linux krb5 packages.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system.

  A problem has been found in the Kerberos ftp client. When retrieving a
  file with a filename beginning with a pipe character, the ftp client will
  pass the filename to the command shell in a system() call. This could
  allow a malicious ftp server to write to files outside of the current
  directory or execute commands as the user running the ftp client.

  The Kerberos ftp client runs as the default ftp client when the Kerberos
  package krb5-workstation is installed on a Red Hat Linux distribution.

  All users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which
  contain a backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.
