summary: "Updated OpenSSL packages are available that fix a potential timing-based\nattack and\
  \ a modified Bleichenbacher attack.\n\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and open\
  \ source toolkit that \nimplements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\n\
  Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library.\n\
  \nResearchers discovered a timing attack on RSA keys.  Applications making\nuse of OpenSSL\
  \ are generally vulnerable to such an attack, unless RSA\nblinding has been turned on.  OpenSSL\
  \ does not use RSA blinding by default\nand most applications do not enable RSA blinding.\
  \  \n\nA local or remote attacker could use this attack to obtain the server's\nprivate key\
  \ by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the\nnumber of extra reductions during\
  \ Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of\ndifferent integer multiplication algorithms (\"\
  Karatsuba\" and normal).\n\nIn order for an attack to be sucessful, an attacker must have\
  \ good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\n\n\
  Additionally, the SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL allow remote attackers\nto perform an\
  \ unauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified\nBleichenbacher attack. This attack\
  \ uses a large number of SSL or TLS\nconnections, using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, and causes OpenSSL\
  \ to leak\ninformation regarding the relationship between ciphertext and the\nassociated plaintext,\
  \ aka the \"Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack.\"\n\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided\
  \ by the OpenSSL group that\nenables RSA blinding by default and protects against the\n\"\
  Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack.\"\n\nBecause server applications are affected by these vulnerabilities,\
  \ users\nare advised to restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality or\nreboot their\
  \ systems after installing these updates."
