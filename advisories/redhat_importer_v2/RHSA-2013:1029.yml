summary: |
  Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes multiple security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Fuse MQ Enterprise, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
  messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

  This release of Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1 is an update to
  Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 and includes bug fixes. Refer to the readme file
  included with the patch files for information about the bug fixes.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that, by default, the Apache ActiveMQ web console did not
  require authentication. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the
  state of the Apache ActiveMQ environment, obtain sensitive information, or
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-3060)

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the Apache ActiveMQ
  demo web applications. A remote attacker could use these flaws to inject
  arbitrary web script or HTML on pages displayed by the demo web
  applications. (CVE-2012-6092)

  It was found that a sample Apache ActiveMQ application was deployed by
  default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send the sample
  application requests, allowing them to consume all available broker
  resources. (CVE-2012-6551)

  A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Apache
  ActiveMQ handled cron jobs. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  perform an XSS attack against users viewing the scheduled.jsp page.
  (CVE-2013-1879)

  A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the
  portfolioPublish servlet of the Apache ActiveMQ demo web applications. A
  remote attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary web script or
  HTML. (CVE-2013-1880)

  Note: All of the above flaws only affected the distribution of Apache
  ActiveMQ included in the extras directory of the Fuse MQ Enterprise
  distribution. The Fuse MQ Enterprise product itself was not affected by any
  of the above flaws.

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
  custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
  native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
  HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  The CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team.

  All users of Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1.
