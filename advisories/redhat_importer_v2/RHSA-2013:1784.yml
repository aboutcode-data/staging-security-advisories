summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.0, which
  fixes two security issues, several bugs, and adds various enhancements, is
  now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
  custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
  native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
  HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  A flaw was found in the way method-level authorization for JAX-WS Service
  endpoints was performed by the EJB invocation handler implementation.
  Any restrictions declared on EJB methods were ignored when executing the
  JAX-WS handlers, and only class-level restrictions were applied. A remote
  attacker who is authorized to access the EJB class, could invoke a JAX-WS
  handler which they were not authorized to invoke. (CVE-2013-2133)

  The CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team, and the CVE-2013-2133 issue was discovered by
  Richard Opalka and Arun Neelicattu of Red Hat.

  This release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.1.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Documentation for
  these changes will be available shortly from the JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.2.0 Release Notes, linked to in the References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
