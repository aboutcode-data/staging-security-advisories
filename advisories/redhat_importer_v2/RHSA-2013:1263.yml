  - CVE-2012-0818
summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Storage Console packages that fix one security issue,
  various bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Storage
  Server 2.1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Storage Console (RHS-C) is a powerful and simple web based
  Graphical User Interface for managing a Red Hat Storage 2.1 environment.
  This feature is provided as a Technology Preview, and is currently not
  supported under Red Hat Storage subscription services. Refer to the
  following for more information about Technology Previews:
  https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/

  It was found that RESTEasy was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE)
  attacks. If a remote attacker who is able to access the Red Hat Storage
  Console REST API submitted a request containing an external XML entity
  to a RESTEasy endpoint, the entity would be resolved, allowing the
  attacker to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server. This flaw affected DOM (Document Object Model) Document and JAXB
  (Java Architecture for XML Binding) input. (CVE-2012-0818)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * A new server could not be added to a cluster if the required packages
  were not installed on the server. Now, the administrator can add a server
  to a cluster which will automatically install the required packages, if
  missing. (BZ#850431)

  * Previously, the rhs-log-collector tool did not collect GlusterFS related
  logs. (BZ#855271)

  * Previously, it was not possible for rhsc-setup to complete successfully
  on systems that have SELinux in disabled mode. (BZ#841342)

  * The 'Add Brick' button in the 'Add Bricks' pop up is now placed next to
  the 'Brick Directory' field for a better UI experience. (BZ#863929)

  * The UUID of the volume was not visible. Now, a new field is added to the
  'Summary' sub-tab of the 'Volumes' tab to display the UUIDs. (BZ#887806)

  * The web console was not accessible after a server reboot. The setup
  mechanism has been modified to ensure the web console is accessible after a
  server reboot. (BZ#838284)

  This update also adds the following enhancements:

  * Previously, to import an existing storage cluster into the Red Hat
  Storage Console the hosts were added one by one. Now, a new feature has
  been added that allows users to import an existing storage cluster. The new
  Cluster Creation window has an option to import an existing storage
  cluster. If IP_Address or the hostname and password of one of the hosts of
  the cluster is entered, a list containing all the hosts of the cluster is
  displayed and the same can be added to the Console. The volumes which are
  part of the cluster also get imported. (BZ#850438)

  * The command line was required to enable a volume to use CIFS. Now, you
  can enable or disable the export of a volume with the new 'CIFS' checkbox
  in the 'Create Volume' window. (BZ#850452)

  * The new Red Hat Support plug-in for Red Hat Storage is a Technology
  Preview feature that offers seamless, integrated access to the Red Hat
  subscription services from the Red Hat Customer Portal. Subscribers who
  install this plug-in can access these features:

  - Create, manage, and update the Red Hat support cases.
  - Conveniently access exclusive Red Hat knowledge and solutions.
  - Search error codes, messages, etc. and view related knowledge from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal. (BZ#999245)

  * A new 'Event ID' column is added to the 'Events' table in the 'Advanced
  View' of 'Events' tab which allows users to see the ID of each event in the
  'Events' tab. (BZ#889942)

  * A new feature is added to manage and monitor the hooks on the Console. It
  also reports changes in the hooks and checks for new hook scripts by
  polling at regular intervals. (BZ#850483)

  * A new 'Optimize for Virt Store' option is added to optimize a volume to
  use it as a virt store. The system sets the "virt" group option on the
  volume and also the following two volume options:

  - storage.owner-uid=36
  - storage.owner-gid=36

  This option is available during volume creation and also for existing
  volumes. (BZ#891493, BZ#891491)

  All users of Red Hat Storage Server 2.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages.
