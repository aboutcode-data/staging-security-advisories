summary: |
  JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.1, which fixes one security issue and
  various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The JBoss Communications Platform (JBCP) is an open source VoIP platform
  certified for JAIN SLEE 1.1 and SIP Servlets 1.1 compliance. JBCP serves as
  a high performance core for Service Delivery Platforms (SDPs) and IP
  Multimedia Subsystems (IMSs) by leveraging J2EE to enable the convergence
  of data and video in Next-Generation Intelligent Network (NGIN)
  applications.

  This release of JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.1 serves as a replacement
  to JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.0. It includes various bug fixes which
  are detailed in the Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available
  shortly from the link in the References section.

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss
  Expression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing
  arbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to
  certain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly
  configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of
  this flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)

  If you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy of
  the JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the
  updated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.

  Red Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting
  this issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Communications Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files.

  All users of JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Communications
  Platform 5.1.1.
