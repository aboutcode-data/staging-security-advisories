  - CVE-2015-1852
summary: |
  Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command-line utility
  for interacting with the OpenStack Identity API.

  It was discovered that some items in the S3Token configuration as used by
  python-keystoneclient were incorrectly evaluated as strings, an issue
  similar to CVE-2014-7144. If the "insecure" option was set to "false", the
  option would be evaluated as true, resulting in TLS connections being
  vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Note: The "insecure" option
  defaults to false, so setups that do not specifically define
  "insecure=false" are not affected. (CVE-2015-1852)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original reporter.

  All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
