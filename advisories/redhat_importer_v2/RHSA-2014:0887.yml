summary: |
  This advisory contains instructions on how to resolve one security issue
  found in the JBoss Remoting component, which is included in Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0, Red Hat JBoss BRMS 5.3.1, Red Hat
  JBoss Portal Platform 5.2.2, and Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this security issue as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Remoting is a stand-alone project that provides an API for making
  remote invocations using pluggable transports and data marshallers.

  JBoss Application Server 5 and supported Red Hat JBoss 5.x products contain
  JBoss Remoting, which includes a partial implementation of the JMX remoting
  specification JSR 160. This implementation is provided in jmx-remoting.sar,
  which is deployed by default in unsupported community releases of JBoss
  Application Server 5.x. This implementation does not implement security as
  defined in JSR 160, and therefore does not apply any authentication or
  authorization constraints. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server. All of the
  supported Red Hat JBoss 5.x products are not affected by this issue in
  their default configuration. These products are only vulnerable if JMX
  remoting is enabled by manually deploying jmx-remoting.sar from the
  jboss-as/docs/examples directory. Unsupported community releases of JBoss
  Application Server 5.x are affected. All users of the standalone JBoss
  Remoting project are also affected. (CVE-2014-3518)

  Red Hat would like to thank Harun ESUR of Sceptive for reporting this
  issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0, Red Hat
  JBoss BRMS 5.3.1, Red Hat JBoss Portal Platform 5.2.2, and Red Hat JBoss
  SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal who have
  jmx-remoting.sar deployed are advised to follow the instructions provided
  in the Solution section of this advisory.
