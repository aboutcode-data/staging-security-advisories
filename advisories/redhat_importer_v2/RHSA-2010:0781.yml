summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2010-3176, CVE-2010-3180)

  A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in SeaMonkey converted text
  into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
  a victim running SeaMonkey, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in
  the context of the Gopher domain. (CVE-2010-3177)

  A flaw was found in the script that launches SeaMonkey. The LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
  to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
  SeaMonkey, if that user ran SeaMonkey from within an attacker-controlled
  directory. (CVE-2010-3182)

  It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
  implementation for key exchanges in SeaMonkey accepted DHE keys that were
  256 bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as
  such keys are easily broken using modern hardware. (CVE-2010-3173)

  A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey matched SSL certificates when the
  certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
  address. SeaMonkey incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that
  fell within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
  possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
  (CVE-2010-3170)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
