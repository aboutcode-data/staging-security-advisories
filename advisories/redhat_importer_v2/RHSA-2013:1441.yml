summary: |
  An updated rubygems package that fixes three security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third-party
  libraries.

  It was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead
  to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)

  It was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected
  from HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing
  a gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to
  HTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)

  It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
  unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
  a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
  of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

  Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting CVE-2013-4287.
  Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter.

  All rubygems users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
