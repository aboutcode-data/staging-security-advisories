summary: "Updated firefox packages that fix several security bugs are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.\n\
  \nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox processes certain malformed\nJavascript code.\
  \ A malicious web page could cause the execution of\nJavascript code in such a way that could\
  \ cause Firefox to crash or execute\narbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5463,\
  \ CVE-2006-5747,\nCVE-2006-5748)\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox renders web\
  \ pages. A malicious\nweb page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute arbitrary\n\
  code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5464) \n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox\
  \ verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys\nwith exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to\
  \ forge a signature that\nwould be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Firefox as shipped\
  \ trusts\nseveral root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An attacker could\nhave\
  \ created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be incorrectly\ntrusted when their site\
  \ was visited by a victim. This flaw was previously\nthought to be fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.7,\
  \ however Ulrich Kuehn discovered the\nfix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)\n\nUsers of Firefox\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain Firefox version 1.5.0.8\
  \ that corrects these issues."
