  - CVE-2015-5963
summary: |
  Updated python-django packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
  development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much
  as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

  It was found that Django incorrectly handled the session store. A session
  could be created by anonymously accessing the
  django.contrib.auth.views.logout view if it was not decorated correctly
  with django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to fill up the session store or cause other users' session
  records to be evicted by requesting a large number of new sessions.
  (CVE-2015-5963)

  Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting this
  issue.

  All python-django users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
