summary: "An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes several security issues,\nbugs, and\
  \ enhancements is now available.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Important \nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base \nscore,\
  \ which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the \nCVE link in the References\
  \ section.\n\nThe rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise \nVirtualization Hypervisor\
  \ ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise \nVirtualization Hypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based\
  \ Virtual Machine \n(KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything necessary to run and manage \n\
  virtual machines: a subset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating \nenvironment and the\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\
  \ is only available \nfor the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization \nextensions.\n\
  \nA padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version \n2.0 (SSLv2) protocol.\
  \ An attacker could potentially use this flaw to \ndecrypt RSA-encrypted cipher text from\
  \ a connection using a newer \nSSL/TLS protocol version, allowing them to decrypt such connections.\
  \ \nThis cross-protocol attack is publicly referred to as DROWN. \n(CVE-2016-0800)\n\nNote:\
  \ This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by \ndefault when using the 'SSLv23'\
  \ connection methods, and removing \nsupport for weak SSLv2 cipher suites. For more information,\
  \ refer to \nthe knowledge base article linked in the References section.\n\nA flaw was found\
  \ in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate \nSSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled\
  \ on the server. This could \nresult in weak SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections,\
  \ \nmaking them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)\n\nA side-channel\
  \ attack was found that makes use of cache-bank \nconflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture.\
  \ An attacker \nwho has the ability to control code in a thread running on the same \nhyper-threaded\
  \ core as the victim's thread that is performing \ndecryption, could use this flaw to recover\
  \ RSA private keys. \n(CVE-2016-0702)\n\nA double-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed\
  \ certain \nmalformed DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) private keys. An \nattacker could\
  \ create specially crafted DSA private keys that, when \nprocessed by an application compiled\
  \ against OpenSSL, could cause \nthe application to crash. (CVE-2016-0705)\n\nAn integer overflow\
  \ flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a\nheap-based memory corruption, was found\
  \ in the way some BIGNUM \nfunctions of OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these\
  \ \nfunctions with large untrusted input could crash or, potentially, \nexecute arbitrary\
  \ code. (CVE-2016-0797)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these\
  \ \nissues. Upstream acknowledges Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel\nas the original reporters\
  \ of CVE-2016-0800 and CVE-2015-3197; Yuval\nYarom (University of Adelaide and NICTA), Daniel\
  \ Genkin (Technion\nand Tel Aviv University), Nadia Heninger (University of Pennsylvania)\n\
  as the original reporters of CVE-2016-0702; Adam Langley (Google/\nBoringSSL) as the original\
  \ reporter of CVE-2016-0705; and Guido\nVranken as the original reporter of CVE-2016-0797.\n\
  \nAll openssl users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contain backported\
  \ patches to correct these issues. For the \nupdate to take effect, all services linked to\
  \ the OpenSSL library \nmust be restarted, or the system rebooted.\n\nChanges to the rhev-hypervisor\
  \ component:\n\n* Previously, a race between services during boot prevented network \nconfiguration\
  \ from upgrading correctly. The risk for the race has \nnow been reduced significantly to\
  \ allow the upgrade of the network \nconfiguration to complete correctly. (BZ#1194068)\n\n\
  * Previously, using the text user interface (TUI) to log in to the \nadministrator account\
  \ of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization \nHypervisor failed with a Python backtrace. This update\
  \ makes the \n\"six\" module correctly importable under all circumstances, which \nensures\
  \ that logging in to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization \nHypervisor using TUI proceeds as\
  \ expected. (BZ#1246836)"
