summary: |
  An updated mod_wsgi package that fixes two security issues is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The mod_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI-compliant
  interface for hosting Python-based web applications within Apache.

  It was found that mod_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if the call to
  setuid() failed. If mod_wsgi was set up to allow unprivileged users to run
  WSGI applications, a local user able to run a WSGI application could
  possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2014-0240)

  Note: mod_wsgi is not intended to provide privilege separation for WSGI
  applications. Systems relying on mod_wsgi to limit or sandbox the
  privileges of mod_wsgi applications should migrate to a different solution
  with proper privilege separation.

  It was discovered that mod_wsgi could leak memory of a hosted web
  application via the "Content-Type" header. A remote attacker could possibly
  use this flaw to disclose limited portions of the web application's memory.
  (CVE-2014-0242)

  Red Hat would like to thank Graham Dumpleton for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Róbert Kisteleki as the original reporter of
  CVE-2014-0240, and Buck Golemon as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0242.

  All mod_wsgi users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues.
