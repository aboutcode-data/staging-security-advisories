  It was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML Java
  implementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity
  (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)

  It was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project
  allowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying
  Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
  denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.1.
