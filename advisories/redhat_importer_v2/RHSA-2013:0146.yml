  - CVE-2012-3546
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 that fixes
  one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Web is the web container, based on Apache Tomcat, in JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It provides a single deployment platform for the
  JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies.

  It was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with
  another component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to
  FormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was
  possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator
  by appending "/j_security_check" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker
  with an authenticated session on an affected application could use this
  flaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not
  permitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.
  (CVE-2012-3546)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 CP10 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
