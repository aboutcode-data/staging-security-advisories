  - CVE-2009-1189
summary: |
  Updated dbus packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  D-Bus is a system for sending messages between applications. It is used for
  the system-wide message bus service and as a per-user-login-session
  messaging facility.

  It was discovered that the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2009:0008 did
  not correctly fix the denial of service flaw in the system for sending
  messages between applications. A local user could use this flaw to send a
  message with a malformed signature to the bus, causing the bus (and,
  consequently, any process using libdbus to receive messages) to abort.
  (CVE-2009-1189)

  Note: Users running any application providing services over the system
  message bus are advised to test this update carefully before deploying it
  in production environments.

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take effect, all
  running instances of dbus-daemon and all running applications using the
  libdbus library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
