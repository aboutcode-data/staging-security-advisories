summary: |
  An update for file is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The file command is used to identify a particular file according to the type of data the file contains. It can identify many different file types, including Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binary files, system libraries, RPM packages, and different graphics formats.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Multiple flaws were found in the file regular expression rules for detecting various files. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause file to consume an excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2014-3538)

  * A denial of service flaw was found in the way file parsed certain Composite Document Format (CDF) files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash file via a specially crafted CDF file. (CVE-2014-3587)

  * Multiple flaws were found in the way file parsed Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause file to crash, disclose portions of its memory, or consume an excessive amount of system resources. (CVE-2014-3710, CVE-2014-8116, CVE-2014-8117, CVE-2014-9620, CVE-2014-9653)
