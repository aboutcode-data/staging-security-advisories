summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite
  implementation handled sending of certain UDP packets over sockets that
  used the UDP_CORK option when the UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) feature
  was enabled on the output device. A local, unprivileged user could use this
  flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, escalate their
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-4470, Important)

  * A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic_get_tmcct() function in KVM's
  Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.
  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
  (CVE-2013-6367, Important)

  * A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way KVM handled virtual
  APIC accesses that crossed a page boundary. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-6368, Important)

  * An information leak flaw in the Linux kernel could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to leak kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2013-2141, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hannes Frederic Sowa for reporting
  CVE-2013-4470, and Andrew Honig of Google for reporting CVE-2013-6367 and
  CVE-2013-6368.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds two enhancements.
  Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
  Technical Notes document linked to in the References section

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.
