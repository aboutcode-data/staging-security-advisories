summary: |
  Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix one security issue and multiple
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the
  presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend
  physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and
  NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports
  volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations.
  Programatic management is available via Block Storage’s API.

  A flaw was found in the GlusterFS and Linux smbfs drivers for OpenStack
  Block Storage. A remote attacker could use this flaw to disclose an
  arbitrary file from the cinder-volume host to a virtual instance by cloning
  and attaching a volume with a malicious qcow2 header. (CVE-2014-3641)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard as the original
  reporter.

  The openstack-cinder packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1149750)

  All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the cinder running services will be restarted automatically.
