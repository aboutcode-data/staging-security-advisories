  - CVE-2006-3918
summary: "Updated Apache httpd packages that correct a security issue are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web\
  \ server available for free. \n\nA bug was found in Apache where an invalid Expect header\
  \ sent to the server\nwas returned to the user in an unescaped error message. This could\n\
  allow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim was\ntricked into connecting\
  \ to a site and sending a carefully crafted Expect\nheader. (CVE-2006-3918)\n\nWhile a web\
  \ browser cannot be forced to send an arbitrary Expect header by\na third-party attacker,\
  \ it was recently discovered that certain versions of\nthe Flash plugin can manipulate request\
  \ headers. If users running such\nversions can be persuaded to load a web page with a malicious\
  \ Flash applet,\na cross-site scripting attack against the server may be possible.\n\nUsers\
  \ of Apache should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to\
  \ correct this issue."
