  - CVE-2002-0651
summary: "Version 9 of ISC BIND, prior to version 9.2.1, contained a denial of\nservice (DoS)\
  \ attack vulnerability.  Various versions of the ISC BIND\nresolver libraries are vulnerable\
  \ to a buffer overflow attack.\n\nISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation\
  \ of the DNS \n(Domain Name System) protocols.  BIND includes a DNS server (named) --\nwhich\
  \ resolves hostnames to IP addresses, a resolver library\n(routines for applications to use\
  \ when interfacing with DNS), and\nvarious tools.\n\nVersions of BIND 9 prior to 9.2.1 have\
  \ a bug that causes certain requests\nto the BIND name server to fail an internal consistency\
  \ check, causing the\nname server to stop responding to requests.  This can be used by a remote\n\
  attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack against name servers. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0400 to this issue.\n\
  \nA buffer overflow vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of DNS\nresolver libraries.\
  \ Applications that utilize vulnerable DNS resolver\nlibraries may be affected. A remote attacker\
  \ who is able to send malicious\nDNS responses could potentially exploit this vulnerability\
  \ to execute\narbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) attack on a vulnerable\nsystem.\
  \ Red Hat Linux does not ship with any applications or libraries that\nlink against the BIND\
  \ resolver libraries; however, third party code may be\naffected. (CAN-2002-0651)\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Linux Advanced Server shipped with a version of ISC BIND vulnerable\nto both of these issues.\
  \  All users of BIND are advised to upgrade to the\nerrata packages containing BIND 9.2.1\
  \ which contains backported patches\nthat correct these issues."
