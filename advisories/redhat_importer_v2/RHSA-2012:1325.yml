summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues and
  one bug is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences
  when emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to
  write to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual
  console back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the
  host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)

  This flaw did not affect the default use of Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Hypervisor: it is not possible to add a device that uses a
  virtual console back-end via Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  To specify a virtual console back-end for a device and therefore be
  vulnerable to this issue, the device would have to be created another way,
  for example, by using a VDSM hook. Note that at this time hooks can only be
  used on Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts, not Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Hypervisor.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,
  were found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric
  representation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used
  such a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the
  application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2012-3480)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting the CVE-2012-3515
  issue.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2012-4244 (bind issue)

  CVE-2012-3524 (dbus issue)

  CVE-2012-2313, CVE-2012-2384, CVE-2012-2390, CVE-2012-3430, and
  CVE-2012-3552 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2012-3445 (libvirt issue)

  CVE-2011-3102 and CVE-2012-2807 (libxml2 issues)

  CVE-2011-1202, CVE-2011-3970, CVE-2012-2825, CVE-2012-2870, CVE-2012-2871,
  and CVE-2012-2893 (libxslt issues)

  This updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor package also
  fixes the following bug:

  * Previously, the Manager listed all installed Hypervisor ISO images as
  available even when they did not support the VDSM compatibility version
  required by the selected host. The rhev-hypervisor6 package now maintains a
  text file for each installed ISO image. The file lists the VDSM
  compatibility versions supported by the relevant ISO image. The Manager
  uses this information to ensure that only those Hypervisor ISO images that
  are relevant to the selected host are listed. (BZ#856827)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.
