  - CVE-2010-5107
summary: |
  Updated openssh packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenSSH is OpenBSD's Secure Shell (SSH) protocol implementation.
  These packages include the core files necessary for the OpenSSH client
  and server.

  The default OpenSSH configuration made it easy for remote attackers to
  exhaust unauthorized connection slots and prevent other users from being
  able to log in to a system. This flaw has been addressed by enabling random
  early connection drops by setting MaxStartups to 10:30:100 by default.
  For more information, refer to the sshd_config(5) man page. (CVE-2010-5107)

  These updated openssh packages include numerous bug fixes and enhancements.
  Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory.
  Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical Notes,
  linked to in the References, for information on the most significant of
  these changes.

  All openssh users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add
  these enhancements.
