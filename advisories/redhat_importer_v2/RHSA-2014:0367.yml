  - CVE-2014-0006
summary: |
  Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
  containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
  data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
  redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
  replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
  consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
  deployment.

  A timing attack flaw was found in the way the swift TempURL middleware
  responded to arbitrary TempURL requests. An attacker with knowledge of an
  object's name could use this flaw to obtain a secret URL to this object,
  which was intended to be publicly shared only with specific recipients, if
  the object had the TempURL key set. Note that only setups using the TempURL
  middleware were affected. (CVE-2014-0006)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Samuel Merritt of SwiftStack as the original
  reporter.

  All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
  OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.
