  - CVE-2007-1558
summary: |
  Updated evolution packages that fix a security bug are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Evolution is the GNOME collection of personal information management (PIM)
  tools.

  A flaw was found in the way Evolution processed certain APOP authentication
  requests. A remote attacker could potentially acquire certain portions of a
  user's authentication credentials by sending certain responses when
  evolution-data-server attempted to authenticate against an APOP server.
  (CVE-2007-1558)

  All users of Evolution should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch which resolves this issue.
