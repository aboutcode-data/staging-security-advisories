  - CVE-2014-0058
summary: |
  Updated Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.1 packages that
  fix one security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
  and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the security audit functionality, as provided by Red Hat
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6, logged request parameters in plain
  text. This may have caused passwords to be included in the audit log files
  when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access
  to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to obtain application or
  server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)

  The provided patch to fix CVE-2014-0058 also allows greater control over
  which of the following components of web requests are captured in audit
  logs:

   - parameters
   - cookies
   - headers
   - attributes

  It is also possible to selectively mask some elements of headers,
  parameters, cookies, and attributes using masks. This capability is
  provided by two system properties, which are introduced by this patch:

  1) org.jboss.security.web.audit

  Description:
  This property controls the granularity of the security auditing of web
  requests.

  Possible values:
  off = Disables auditing of web requests
  headers = Audits only the headers of web requests
  cookies = Audits only the cookies of web requests
  parameters = Audits only the parameters of web requests
  attributes = Audits only the attributes of web requests
  headers,cookies,parameters = Audits the headers, cookies, and parameters of
  web requests
  headers,cookies = Audits the headers and cookies of web requests

  Default Value:
  headers, parameters

  Examples:
  Setting "org.jboss.security.web.audit=off" disables security auditing of
  web requests entirely.
  Setting "org.jboss.security.web.audit=headers" enables security auditing of
  only headers in web requests.

  2) org.jboss.security.web.audit.mask

  Description:
  This property can be used to specify a list of strings to be matched
  against headers, parameters, cookies, and attributes of web requests.
  Any element matching the specified masks will be excluded from security
  audit logging.

  Possible values:
  Any comma separated string indicating keys of headers, parameters, cookies,
  and attributes.

  Default Value:
  j_password, authorization

  Note that currently the matching of the masks is fuzzy rather than strict.
  For example, a mask of "authorization" will mask both the header called
  authorization and the parameter called "custom_authorization". A future
  release may introduce strict masks.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.1 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
