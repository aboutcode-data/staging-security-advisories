  - CVE-2014-3517
summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
  (Icehouse) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenStack Compute (Nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.

  A side-channel timing attack flaw was found in Nova. An attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to guess valid instance ID signatures, giving them
  access to details of another instance, by analyzing the response times of
  requests for instance metadata. This issue only affected configurations
  that proxy metadata requests via Neutron. (CVE-2014-3517)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor from Rackspace as the original reporter.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The GlusterFS driver changes the file name used to point to a volume when
  a snapshot is changed, but in the past the new file name was not stored in
  Compute's block device information.

  As a result, if the VM was shut down and started again, the old file name
  in the snapshot chain was used, resulting in corruption of the qcow2 chain
  and unexpected results in the instance.

  This has been fixed by persisting the new file name in Compute's block
  device info when a snapshot is created. Now, GlusterFS volumes work as
  expected after creating or deleting a snapshot and then rebooting the
  instance. (BZ#1085852)

  * Previously, in some cases, it may not have been possible to attach a
  read-only volume to an instance. (BZ#1100358)

  * The sysfsutils package enables the Compute service to attach Block
  Storage volumes. This package is automatically installed by PackStack.
  However, sysfsutils was not a dependency of the Compute service; as such,
  when not using PackStack, it was possible to deploy OpenStack without
  sysfsutils installed. When this occurred, the Compute service was unable to
  attach Block Storage volumes.

  With this release, the sysfsutils package is now a dependency of the
  Compute service. This ensures that sysfsutils is installed, regardless of
  what deployment method is used. (BZ#1114637)

  * An issue with Fibre Channel Cinder volumes not being removed after the
  image has been destroyed has been fixed. (BZ#1115375)

  * This update fixes legacy group support, allowing you to provide a group
  by name in the scheduler hint instead of using the new server groups API.
  (BZ#1116866)

  * The openstack-nova package has been updated to upstream version
  2014.1.1, which fixes a number of bugs. (BZ#1117895)

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues.
