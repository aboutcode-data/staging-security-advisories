aliases:
  - CVE-2009-5138
  - CVE-2014-0092
summary: |
  Updated gnutls packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
  protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

  It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that
  could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to
  incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this
  flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by
  GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker. (CVE-2014-0092)

  A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS handled version 1 X.509 certificates.
  An attacker able to obtain a version 1 certificate from a trusted
  certificate authority could use this flaw to issue certificates for other
  sites that would be accepted by GnuTLS as valid. (CVE-2009-5138)

  The CVE-2014-0092 issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the
  Red Hat Security Technologies Team.

  Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
  linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted.
