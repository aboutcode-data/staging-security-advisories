  - CVE-2011-3648
summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled
  certain multibyte character sets. Malicious, remote content could cause
  Thunderbird to run JavaScript code with the permissions of different remote
  content. (CVE-2011-3648)

  Note: This issue cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted HTML mail
  message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages. It could be
  exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full
  remote content of an RSS feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves this issue. All running instances of Thunderbird must be restarted
  for the update to take effect.
