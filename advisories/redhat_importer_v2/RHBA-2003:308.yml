  - CVE-2003-0961
summary: "Updated kernel packages are now available that allow 32-bit\ncompatibility-mode applications\
  \ to utilize a larger address space on the\nAMD64 architecture.\n\n[Updated 01 Dec 2003]\n\
  Note: This errata also fixed a bug in the do_brk() function, which has now\nbeen found to\
  \ have security consequences: allowing a local attacker to gain\nroot privileges (CAN-2003-0961).\
  \  There is no change to the packages\nassociated with this advisory.\n\nThe Linux kernel\
  \ handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThe initial release of the Red Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 3 kernel for the AMD64\narchitecture limited the amount of virtual address\
  \ space available to\napplications compiled on a 32-bit (x86) architecture to an unnecessary\
  \ \ndegree.  A side effect of this restriction was that some applications\nwith large address\
  \ space requirements might execute successfully on an \nx86-based platform, but might not\
  \ run on an AMD64-based platform.\n\nThese updated kernel packages significantly raise this\
  \ address space limit."
