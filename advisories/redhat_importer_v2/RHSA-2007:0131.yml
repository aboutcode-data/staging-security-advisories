  - CVE-2007-1560
summary: |
  An updated squid package that fixes a security vulnerability is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
  supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Squid processed the TRACE
  request method. It was possible for an attacker behind the Squid proxy
  to issue a malformed TRACE request, crashing the Squid daemon child
  process. As long as these requests were sent, it would prevent
  legitimate usage of the proxy server. (CVE-2007-1560)

  This flaw does not affect the version of Squid shipped in Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, or 4.

  Users of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.
