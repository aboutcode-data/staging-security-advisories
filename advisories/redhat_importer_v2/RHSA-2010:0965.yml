summary: |
  A patch for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0.CP09 that fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Remoting is a framework for building distributed applications in
  Java.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0.CP09 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal did not, unlike the RHSA-2010:0939 erratum text stated,
  provide a fix for CVE-2010-3862. A remote attacker could use
  specially-crafted input to cause the JBoss Remoting listeners to become
  unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition for services
  communicating via JBoss Remoting sockets. (CVE-2010-4265)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ole Husgaard of eXerp.com for reporting this
  issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, backup your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform installation (including all applications and
  configuration files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0.CP09 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this patch. Refer to
  the Solution section of this erratum for patch download instructions.
