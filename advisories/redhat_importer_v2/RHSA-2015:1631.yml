summary: |
  An updated ceph-deploy package that fixes two security issues is now
  available in Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.2 for CentOS 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
  storage platform that combines the most stable version of Ceph with a Ceph
  management platform, deployment tools, and support services.

  It was discovered that ceph-deploy, a utility for deploying Red Hat Ceph
  Storage, would create the keyring file with world readable permissions,
  which could possibly allow a local user to obtain authentication
  credentials from the keyring file. (CVE-2015-3010, CVE-2015-4053)

  ceph has been upgraded from v0.80.8.1 to v0.80.8.2. This upgrade fixes the
  following bugs:

  * .rgw pool contains extra objects (BZ#1212524)
  * rgw bucket/object owner override when setting acls (BZ#1214051)
  * librbd: aio calls may block (BZ#1225172)

  ice_setup has been upgraded from v0.3.0-2 to v0.3.2. This upgrade fixes a
  bug where ice_setup would crash if the "setuptools" Python package was not
  already installed on the Calamari admin node. (rhbz #1212045)

  All ceph-deploy users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects these issues.
