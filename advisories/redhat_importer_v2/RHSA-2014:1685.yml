  - CVE-2014-5356
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
  images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
  and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  It was discovered that the image_size_cap configuration option in glance
  was not honored. An authenticated user could use this flaw to upload an
  image to glance and consume all available storage space, resulting in a
  denial of service. (CVE-2014-5356)

  The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1146089)

  All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the running glance services will be restarted automatically.
