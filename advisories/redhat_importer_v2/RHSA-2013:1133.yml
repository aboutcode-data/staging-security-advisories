  - CVE-2013-1896
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
  handled merge requests. An attacker could use this flaw to send a crafted
  merge request that contains URIs that are not configured for DAV, causing
  the httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2013-1896)

  It was found that mod_rewrite did not filter terminal escape sequences from
  its log file. If mod_rewrite was configured with the RewriteLog directive,
  a remote attacker could use specially-crafted HTTP requests to inject
  terminal escape sequences into the mod_rewrite log file. If a victim viewed
  the log file with a terminal emulator, it could result in arbitrary command
  execution with the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-1862)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After
  installing the updated packages, users must restart the httpd service for
  the update to take effect.
