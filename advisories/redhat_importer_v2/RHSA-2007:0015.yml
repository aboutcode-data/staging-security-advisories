summary: "Updated ImageMagick packages that correct several security issues are now\navailable.\
  \ \n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security\
  \ Response Team.\n\nImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window\n\
  System that can read and write multiple image formats.\n\nSeveral security flaws were discovered\
  \ in the way ImageMagick decodes DCM,\nPALM, and SGI graphic files.  An attacker may be able\
  \ to execute arbitrary\ncode on a victim's machine if they were able to trick the victim into\n\
  opening a specially crafted image file (CVE-2006-5456, CVE-2006-5868).\n\nA heap overflow\
  \ flaw was found in ImageMagick.  An attacker may be able to\nexecute arbitrary code on a\
  \ victim's machine if they were able to trick the\nvictim into opening a specially crafted\
  \ file (CVE-2006-2440).  This issue\nonly affected the version of ImageMagick distributed\
  \ with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4.\n\nUsers of ImageMagick should upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues."
