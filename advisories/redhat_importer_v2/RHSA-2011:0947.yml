summary: |
  Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 packages that fix one
  security issue and various bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market-leading platform for
  innovative and scalable Java applications. JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam into a complete and simple enterprise solution.

  This JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 release for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 5.1.0.

  These updated packages include the bug fixes detailed in the release notes,
  which are linked to from the References section of this erratum.

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2011-1484 was incomplete: JBoss Seam 2
  did not block access to all malicious JBoss Expression Language (EL)
  constructs in page exception handling, allowing arbitrary Java methods to
  be executed. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  code via a specially-crafted URL provided to certain applications based on
  the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly configured and enabled Java
  Security Manager would prevent exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2011-2196)

  Red Hat would like to thank the ObjectWorks+ Development Team at Nomura
  Research Institute for reporting this issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, please back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along
  with all other customized configuration files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.0 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages. Manual
  action is required for this update to take effect. Refer to the Solution
  section for details.
