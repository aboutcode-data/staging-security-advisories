summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 roll up patch 2, which fixes one security
  issue and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
  automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
  existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
  CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
  execution speed and quality.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss SOA
  Platform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security
  issue is also fixed with this release:

  XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
  frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
  insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
  on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
  CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
  recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue affected both the
  JBoss Web Services CXF (jbossws-cxf) and JBoss Web Services Native
  (jbossws-native) stacks. (CVE-2012-5575)

  If you are using jbossws-cxf, then automatic checks to prevent this flaw
  are only run when WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security
  requirements. It is best practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce
  security requirements. To enable WS-Security with this update, you must
  use the global 'war-security domain="JBossWS"' configuration directive at
  the beginning of the jboss-esb.xml file. Refer to the update's
  instructions in the Customer Portal for further information.

  If you are using jbossws-native, the fix for this flaw is implemented by
  two new configuration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element
  can be a child of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration
  descriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's
  jboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes
  are 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a
  blank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for
  the encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key
  wrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by
  default for empty lists or missing attributes.

  For example (do not include the line break in your configuration):

  encryption algorithms="aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm"
  keyWrapAlgorithms="rsa_oaep"

  Specifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the
  only permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and
  RSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.

  Before performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that
  each algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the
  allowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The
  algorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are
  the same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'
  element.

  Red Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
  Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting this issue.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss
  SOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
