  - CVE-2010-3711
summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the way Pidgin
  handled Base64 decoding. A remote attacker could use these flaws to crash
  Pidgin if the target Pidgin user was using the Yahoo! Messenger Protocol,
  MSN, MySpace, or Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) protocol
  plug-ins, or using the Microsoft NT LAN Manager (NTLM) protocol for
  authentication. (CVE-2010-3711)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Pidgin MSN
  protocol plug-in processed custom emoticon messages. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to crash Pidgin by sending specially-crafted emoticon
  messages during mutual communication. (CVE-2010-1624)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Daniel Atallah as the original reporter of
  CVE-2010-3711, and Pierre Noguès of Meta Security as the original reporter
  of CVE-2010-1624.

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Pidgin must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
