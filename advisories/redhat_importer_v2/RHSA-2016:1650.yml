summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
  of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache
  HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector
  (mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.0,
  and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.1.1
  Release Notes, linked to in the References section, for information on the
  most significant of these changes.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP
  requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts,
  which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations
  to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could
  possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script
  to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
  (CVE-2016-5387)

  * It was discovered that OpenSSL would accept ephemeral RSA keys when using
  non-export RSA cipher suites. A malicious server could make a TLS/SSL
  client using OpenSSL use a weaker key exchange method. (CVE-2015-0204)

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the
  way the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts of
  input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application
  using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2105)

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the
  way the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function of OpenSSL parsed very large amounts
  of input data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an
  application using OpenSSL or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
  permissions of the user running that application. (CVE-2016-2106)

  * It was discovered that it is possible to remotely Segfault Apache http
  server with a specially crafted string sent to the mod_cluster via service
  messages (MCMP). (CVE-2016-3110)

  * It was found that OpenSSL's BigNumber Squaring implementation could
  produce incorrect results under certain special conditions. This flaw could
  possibly affect certain OpenSSL library functionality, such as RSA
  blinding. Note that this issue occurred rarely and with a low probability,
  and there is currently no known way of exploiting it. (CVE-2014-3570)

  Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting
  CVE-2016-5387; the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-2105 and
  CVE-2016-2106; and Michal Karm Babacek for reporting CVE-2016-3110.
  Upstream acknowledges Guido Vranken as the original reporter of
  CVE-2016-2105 and CVE-2016-2106.
