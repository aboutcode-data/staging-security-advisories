summary: |
  Updated MySQL server packages for IBM iSeries and pSeries systems fix a
  number of security issues.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server.

  A double-free vulnerability in mysqld, for MySQL before version 3.23.55,
  allows attackers with MySQL access to cause a denial of service (crash) by
  creating a carefully crafted client application. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0073 to this issue.

  MySQL 3.23.55 and earlier creates world-writable files and allows mysql
  users to gain root privileges by using the "SELECT * INFO OUTFILE" operator
  to overwrite a configuration file and cause mysql to run as root upon
  restart. (CAN-2003-0150)

  A signed integer vulnerability in the COM_TABLE_DUMP package for MySQL
  3.x to 3.23.53a allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (crash or hang) in mysqld by causing large negative integers to be provided
  to a memcpy call. (CAN-2002-1373)

  The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to
  4.0.5a allows a remote attacker to gain privileges via a brute force
  attack using a one-character password. This causes MySQL to only compare
  the provided password against the first character of the real
  password. (CAN-2002-1374)

  The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to
  4.0.5a allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
  response. (CAN-2002-1375)

  The MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x
  to 4.0.5a does not properly verify length fields for certain responses
  in the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which allows a malicious server
  to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
  code. (CAN-2002-1376)

  All users of MySQL are advised to upgrade to MySQL 3.23.56 contained within
  this errata, which is not vulnerable to these issues.

  In addition to the security fixes, these erratum packages contain a
  thread safe client library (libmysqlclient_r).
