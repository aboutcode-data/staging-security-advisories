  - CVE-2004-0154
summary: |
  Updated nfs-utils packages that fix a flaw leading to possible rpc.mountd
  crashes are now available.

  The nfs-utils package contains the rpc.mountd program, which implements the
  NFS mount protocol.

  A flaw was discovered in versions of rpc.mountd in nfs-utils versions after
  1.0.3 and prior to 1.0.6.  When mounting a directory, rpc.mountd could
  crash if the reverse lookup of the client in DNS failed to match the
  forward lookup.  An attacker who has the ability to mount remote
  directories from a server could make use of this flaw to cause a denial of
  service by making rpc.mountd crash.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  nfs-utils 1.0.6 and is not vulnerable to this issue.

  NOTE: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 includes a version of rpc.mountd that is
  not vulnerable to this issue.
