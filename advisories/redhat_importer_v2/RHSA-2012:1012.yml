  - CVE-2012-1154
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 that fixes one security
  issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  mod_cluster is an Apache HTTP Server (httpd) based load balancer that
  forwards requests from httpd to application server nodes. It can use the
  AJP, HTTP, or HTTPS protocols for communication with application server
  nodes.

  The RHSA-2012:0036 update for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 introduced
  a regression, causing mod_cluster to register and expose the root context
  of a server by default, even when "ROOT" was in the "excludedContexts" list
  in the mod_cluster configuration. If an application was deployed on the
  root context, a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended
  access restrictions and gain access to that application. (CVE-2012-1154)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
