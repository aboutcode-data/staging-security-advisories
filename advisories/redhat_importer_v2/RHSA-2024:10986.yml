  - CVE-2024-21538
summary: "Updated images that fix several bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenShift Data\
  \ Foundation 4.17.1 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 from Red Hat Container Registry.\n\nRed\
  \ Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is software-defined storage integrated with and optimized\
  \ for the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation. Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is a highly\
  \ scalable, production-grade persistent storage for stateful applications running in the Red\
  \ Hat OpenShift Container Platform. In addition to persistent storage, Red Hat OpenShift Data\
  \ Foundation provisions a multi-cloud data management service with an S3 compatible API.\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* cross-spawn: regular expression denial of service (CVE-2024-21538)\n\
  \nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other\
  \ related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug fixes:\n\
  \nPreviously, as part of monitoring the health of NamespaceStores, Multicloud Object Gateway\
  \ (MCG) counted the I/O errors. This included read errors that occurred when the read failed\
  \ due to no object existing. However, these errors should not be counted towards I/O failures\
  \ as some clients use this type of read errors to find out whether an object exists. With\
  \ this fix, these specific types of errors such as Read, No Such Object are not counted as\
  \ I/O errors.\n(JIRA#DFBUGS-834)\n\nPreviously, Ceph S3 object stores in OpenShift Data Foundation\
  \ external mode needed to rotate certificates each time the RADOS Gateway (RGW) rotated. With\
  \ this fix, well-known certificate authorities (CAs) are used to attempt the authentication\
  \ of Ceph RGW daemons. The well-known CAs are determined based on Red Hat base container image’s\
  \ certificates’ RPM package. The enables OpenShift Data Foundation to continue to operate\
  \ in a healthy status.\n(JIRA#DFBUGS-825)\n\nPreviously, in some cases, a race between an\
  \ incomplete multipart upload that would later be cancelled and a new multipart upload of\
  \ the same object would be deduped togetehr causing inconsistencies in object mapping and\
  \ making it unavailable to read. With this fix, the Multicloud Object Gateway deduplication\
  \ issue is resolved. \n(JIRA#DFBUGS-356)\n\nAll users of Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated images, which provide these bug fixes."
