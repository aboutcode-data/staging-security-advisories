  On December 1st, 2012, per the life-cycle support policy, the following

  Linux 4, exited Production Phase 2 marking the end of their support by
  Red Hat.

  Notes:
  1) Red Hat will continue to support RHN Satellite and Proxy versions 5.2
  and 5.3 running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
  2) All versions of 5.0 and 5.1 are now EOL with this notice.

  Though we are committed to the December 1st date for beginning the process
  of decommissioning Satellite and Proxy support listed, we recognize that
  our customers have woven these products very deeply into their processes
  and may need some time to upgrade.

  For upgrade purposes, please note the following dates:

  * December 1st, 2012 - Satellite and Proxy support for listed versions
  running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, ceased to be supported. Official
  support ended. Only Severity 1 issues and upgrade assistance will be
  addressed. Satellite and Proxy will continue to operate, but all
  customers are encouraged to upgrade in a timely manner.

  * March 1st, 2013 - Satellite and Proxy versions listed - active status
  will be terminated. The Satellite and Proxy versions listed will enter an
  inactive state. This includes no longer generating nor providing Satellite
  Certificates to customers requesting them for these EOL product versions.
