  - CVE-2007-0451
summary: "Updated spamassassin packages that fix a security issue are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSpamAssassin provides a way to reduce unsolicited\
  \ commercial email (spam)\nfrom incoming email.\n\nA flaw was found in the way SpamAssassin\
  \ processes HTML email containing\nURIs. A carefully crafted mail message could cause SpamAssassin\
  \ to consume\nsignificant resources. If a number of these messages are sent, this could\n\
  lead to a denial of service, potentially delaying or preventing the\ndelivery  of email.\n\
  (CVE-2007-0451)\n\nUsers of SpamAssassin should upgrade to these updated packages which\n\
  contain version 3.1.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.  \n\nThis is an upgrade from\
  \ SpamAssassin version 3.0.6 to 3.1.8, which contains\nmany bug fixes and spam detection enhancements.\
  \ Further details are\navailable in the SpamAssassin 3.1 changelog and upgrade guide."
