  - CVE-2010-0405
summary: |
  Updated bzip2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  bzip2 is a freely available, high-quality data compressor. It provides both
  standalone compression and decompression utilities, as well as a shared
  library for use with other programs.

  An integer overflow flaw was discovered in the bzip2 decompression routine.
  This issue could, when decompressing malformed archives, cause bzip2, or an
  application linked against the libbz2 library, to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0405)

  Users of bzip2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. All running applications using the
  libbz2 library must be restarted for the update to take effect.
