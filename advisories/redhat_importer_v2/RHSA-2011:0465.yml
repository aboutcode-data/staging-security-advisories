  - CVE-2011-1586
summary: |
  Updated kdenetwork packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kdenetwork packages contain networking applications for the K Desktop
  Environment (KDE).

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way KGet, a download manager,
  handled the "file" element in Metalink files. An attacker could use this
  flaw to create a specially-crafted Metalink file that, when opened, would
  cause KGet to overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the user running
  KGet. (CVE-2011-1586)

  Users of kdenetwork should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to resolve this issue. The desktop must be restarted
  (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
