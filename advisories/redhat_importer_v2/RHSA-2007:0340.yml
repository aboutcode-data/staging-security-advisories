summary: "Updated tomcat packages that fix multiple security issues are now available\nfor Red\
  \ Hat Application Server.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nTomcat is a servlet container for Java Servlet\
  \ and JavaServer Pages\ntechnologies.\n\nTomcat was found to accept multiple content-length\
  \ headers in a\nrequest. This could allow attackers to poison a web-cache, bypass web\napplication\
  \ firewall protection, or conduct cross-site scripting attacks. \n(CVE-2005-2090)\n\nTomcat\
  \ permitted various characters as path delimiters. If Tomcat was used\nbehind certain proxies\
  \ and configured to only proxy some contexts, an\nattacker could construct an HTTP request\
  \ to work around the context\nrestriction and potentially access non-proxied content. (CVE-2007-0450)\n\
  \nSeveral applications distributed in the JSP examples displayed unfiltered\nvalues. If the\
  \ JSP examples are accessible, these flaws could allow a\nremote attacker to perform cross-site\
  \ scripting attacks. (CVE-2005-4838,\nCVE-2006-7195, CVE-2006-7196)\n\nThe default Tomcat\
  \ configuration permitted the use of insecure\nSSL cipher suites including the anonymous cipher\
  \ suite. (CVE-2007-1858)\n\nDirectory listings were enabled by default in Tomcat. Information\
  \ stored\nunprotected under the document root was visible to anyone if the\nadministrator\
  \ did not disable directory listings. (CVE-2006-3835)\n\nIt was found that generating listings\
  \ of large directories was CPU\nintensive.  An attacker could make repeated requests to obtain\
  \ a directory\nlisting of any large directory, leading to a denial of service. \n(CVE-2005-3510)\n\
  \nUsers should upgrade to these erratum packages which contain an update to\nTomcat and the\
  \ addition of backported security patches to resolve these issues."
