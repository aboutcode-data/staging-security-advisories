summary: |
  Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues,
  several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
  machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
  and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
  64-bit operating systems.

  This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
  (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
  attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
  protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
  supported protocol version fails.

  This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
  The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
  attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
  This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
  POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
  update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
  require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

  For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
  at https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123

  Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.
  A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157,
  CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2014-8137, CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517,
  CVE-2008-3520, CVE-2008-3522)

  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137,
  CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157, CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2011-4516,
  and CVE-2011-4517. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security
  Team as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8137 and CVE-2014-8138; and
  pyddeh as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8157 and CVE-2014-8158.

  The mingw-openssl and mingw-jasper packages have been upgraded to the
  latest upstream version, which provides a number of bug fixes and
  enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1187585)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, a guest system installed with tools incorrectly always
  started in full screen mode, even when the "Open in Full Screen" option was
  unchecked in console options. Now, when connecting in window mode with the
  option unchecked, the guest system starts in a window as expected.
  (BZ#1172126)

  * Prior to this update, copying and pasting of images from the client to
  the guest did not work when spice-gtk was built from upstream. Now, images
  can be copied and pasted without problems. (BZ#1187270)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * Administrators now have the option of automatic multiuser installation of
  virt-viewer onto many client workstations. (BZ#1187272)

  All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancement.
