  - CVE-2012-1167
summary: |
  Updated jbossas-web and jboss-naming packages that fix two security issues
  are now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Application Server is the base package for JBoss Enterprise Web
  Platform, providing the core server components. The Java Naming and
  Directory Interface (JNDI) Java API allows Java software clients to locate
  objects or services in an application server. The Java Authorization
  Contract for Containers (Java ACC) specification defines Permission classes
  and the binding of container access decisions to operations on instances of
  these permission classes. JaccAuthorizationRealm performs authorization
  based on Java ACC permissions and a Policy implementation.

  It was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote
  write access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to
  access the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the
  HAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,
  delete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,
  application-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)

  When a JBoss server is configured to use JaccAuthorizationRealm, the
  WebPermissionMapping class creates permissions that are not checked and can
  permit access to users without checking their roles. If the
  ignoreBaseDecision property is set to true on JBossWebRealm, the web
  authorization process is handled exclusively by JBossAuthorizationEngine,
  without any input from JBoss Web. This allows any valid user to access an
  application, without needing to be assigned the role specified in the
  application's web.xml "security-constraint" tag. (CVE-2012-1167)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting
  CVE-2011-4605.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise Web
  Platform's "server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory and any other customized
  configuration files.

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4,
  5, and 6 should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these
  issues. The JBoss server process must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
