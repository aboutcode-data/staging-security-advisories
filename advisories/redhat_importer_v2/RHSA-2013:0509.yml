summary: |
  Updated RDMA packages that fix multiple security issues, various bugs, and
  add an enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux includes a collection of InfiniBand and iWARP
  utilities, libraries and development packages for writing applications
  that use Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way ibacm managed reference
  counts for multicast connections. An attacker could send specially-crafted
  multicast packets that would cause the ibacm daemon to crash.
  (CVE-2012-4517)

  It was found that the ibacm daemon created some files with world-writable
  permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to overwrite the
  contents of the ibacm.log or ibacm.port file, allowing them to mask
  certain actions from the log or cause ibacm to run on a non-default port.
  (CVE-2012-4518)

  CVE-2012-4518 was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
  Security Team and Kurt Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  The InfiniBand/iWARP/RDMA stack components have been upgraded to more
  recent upstream versions.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, the "ibnodes -h" command did not show a proper usage message.
  With this update the problem is fixed and "ibnodes -h" now shows the
  correct usage message. (BZ#818606)

  * Previously, the ibv_devinfo utility erroneously showed iWARP cxgb3
  hardware's physical state as invalid even when the device was working. For
  iWARP hardware, the phys_state field has no meaning. This update patches
  the utility to not print out anything for this field when the hardware is
  iWARP hardware. (BZ#822781)

  * Prior to the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3, the kernel created
  the InfiniBand device files in the wrong place and a udev rules file was
  used to force the devices to be created in the proper place. With the
  update to 6.3, the kernel was fixed to create the InfiniBand device files
  in the proper place, and so the udev rules file was removed as no longer
  being necessary. However, a bug in the kernel device creation meant that,
  although the devices were now being created in the right place, they had
  incorrect permissions. Consequently, when users attempted to run an RDMA
  application as a non-root user, the application failed to get the necessary
  permissions to use the RDMA device and the application terminated. This
  update puts a new udev rules file in place. It no longer attempts to create
  the InfiniBand devices since they already exist, but it does correct the
  device permissions on the files. (BZ#834428)

  * Previously, using the "perfquery -C" command with a host name caused the
  perfquery utility to become unresponsive. The list of controllers to
  process was never cleared and the process looped infinitely on a single
  controller. A patch has been applied to make sure that in the case where
  the user passes in the -C option, the controller list is cleared out once
  that controller has been processed. As a result, perfquery now works as
  expected in the scenario described. (BZ#847129)

  * The OpenSM init script did not handle the case where there were no
  configuration files under "/etc/rdma/opensm.conf.*". With this update, the
  script as been patched and the InfiniBand Subnet Manager, OpenSM, now
  starts as expected in the scenario described. (BZ#862857)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * This update provides an updated mlx4_ib Mellanox driver which includes
  Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) support. (BZ#869737)

  All users of RDMA are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  fix these issues and add this enhancement.
