summary: |
  Updated Ethereal packages that fix various security vulnerabilities are now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

  Several denial of service bugs were found in Ethereal's protocol
  dissectors. Ethereal could crash or stop responding if it reads a malformed
  packet off the network.  (CVE-2006-1932, CVE-2006-1933, CVE-2006-1937,
  CVE-2006-1938, CVE-2006-1939, CVE-2006-1940)

  Several buffer overflow bugs were found in Ethereal's COPS, telnet, and
  ALCAP dissectors as well as Network Instruments file code and
  NetXray/Windows Sniffer file code.  Ethereal could crash or execute
  arbitrary code if it reads a malformed packet off the network.
  (CVE-2006-1934, CVE-2006-1935, CVE-2006-1936)

  Users of ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages containing
  version 0.99.0, which is not vulnerable to these issues.
