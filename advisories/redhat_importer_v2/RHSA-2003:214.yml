summary: "Updated tcpdump, libpcap, and arpwatch packages for iSeries and pSeries fix\nvarious\
  \ vulnerabilities.\n\nTcpdump is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic. \n\n\
  The Red Hat tcpdump packages advertise that by default tcpdump will drop\npermissions to user\
  \ 'pcap'.  Due to a compilation error this did not\nhappen, and tcpdump would run as root\
  \ unless the '-U' flag was specified.\n\nUsers of tcpdump are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ errata packages, which\nare compiled so that by default tcpdump will drop privileges to\
  \ the\n'pcap' user.\n\nThe BGP decoding routines in tcpdump before 3.6.2 used incorrect bounds\n\
  checking when copying data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service and\
  \ possibly execute arbitrary code (as the 'pcap' user).\n\nThe RADIUS decoder in tcpdump 3.6.2\
  \ and earlier allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid\
  \ RADIUS packet with a\nheader length field of 0. This causes tcpdump to generate data within\
  \ an\ninfinite loop.\n\nA vulnerability in tcpdump before 3.7.2 is related to an inability\
  \ to\nhandle unknown RADIUS attributes properly, and allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial\
  \ of service (infinite loop).\n\nThe ISAKMP parser in tcpdump 3.6 through 3.7.1 allows remote\
  \ attackers to\ncause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed ISAKMP packet\n\
  to UDP port 500, causing tcpdump to enter an infinite loop.\n\nVersions of tcpdump up to and\
  \ including 3.6.2 have a buffer overflow that\ncan be triggered when tracing the network by\
  \ a bad NFS packet. This issue\nwas found by David Woodhouse of Red Hat.\n\nUsers of tcpdump\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain patches to correct these\
  \ issues."
