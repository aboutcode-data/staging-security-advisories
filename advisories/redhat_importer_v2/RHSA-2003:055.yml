summary: "Updated rxvt packages are available which fix a number of vulnerabilities\nin the\
  \ handling of escape sequences.\n\n[Updated 12 March 2003]\nAdded packages for Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux WS\n\nRxvt is a color VT102 terminal emulator for\
  \ the X Window System.  A number\nof issues have been found in the escape sequence handling\
  \ of Rxvt.\nThese could be potentially exploited if an attacker can cause carefully\ncrafted\
  \ escape sequences to be displayed on an rxvt terminal being used by\ntheir victim. \n\nOne\
  \ of the features which most terminal emulators support is the ability\nfor the shell to set\
  \ the title of the window using an escape sequence. \nCertain xterm variants, including rxvt,\
  \ also provide an escape sequence for\nreporting the current window title.  This essentially\
  \ takes the current\ntitle and places it directly on the command line.  Since it is not\n\
  possible to embed a carriage return into the window title itself, the\nattacker would have\
  \ to convince the victim to press the Enter key for the\ntitle to be processed as a command,\
  \ although the attacker can perform a\nnumber of actions to increase the likelihood of this\
  \ happening.\n\nA certain escape sequence when displayed in rxvt will create an arbitrary\n\
  file.  \n\nIt is possible to add malicious items to the dynamic menus through an\nescape sequence.\n\
  \nUsers of Rxvt are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which contain\na patch to\
  \ disable the title reporting functionality and patches to correct\nthe other issues.\n\n\
  Red Hat would like to thank H D Moore for bringing these issues to our\nattention."
