  - CVE-2019-14835
summary: |
  An update for redhat-release-virtualization-host and redhat-virtualization-host is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.2), redhat-virtualization-host (4.2). (BZ#1751435)

  Security Fix(es):

  * A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host. (CVE-2019-14835)
