summary: "An updated redhat-upgrade-tool package that fixes several bugs is now available for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nThe Red Hat Upgrade Tool is used for performing an in-place\
  \ upgrade of your\ncurrent system to the next major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It\n\
  determines what packages are needed for the upgrade and gathers them from the\nsource or sources\
  \ given. It also fetches and sets up the boot images needed to\nrun the upgrade and sets up\
  \ the system to perform the upgrade on the next system\nboot. Running the Red Hat Upgrade\
  \ Tool requires running the Preupgrade Assistant\nas a prerequisite.\n\nThis update fixes\
  \ the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) repository\
  \ setup did\nnot correctly specify the appropriate URLs. As a consequence,\npreupgrade-assistant\
  \ postupgrade scripts could not use the Yum utility, and an\nerror message was displayed.\
  \ With this update, the \"skip_if_unavailable\" option\nhas been set to \"True\" for all generated\
  \ repository files, and the errors no\nlonger occur. (BZ#1106401)\n\n* Previously, using the\
  \ \"--addrepo\" option with an incorrect argument returned a\nconfusing error message that\
  \ no upgrade was available from the repository. As a\nconsequence, it was not clear whether\
  \ the specified URL was incorrect or there\nwas no upgrade available from the repository.\
  \ This update improves the error\nmessage which now suggests checking if the specified URL\
  \ is correct.\n(BZ#1084985)\n\n* After an upgrade, when one of the postupgrade scripts attempted\
  \ to downgrade\nseveral packages, downgrade failed because of errors downloading the GPG keys.\n\
  This bug has been fixed by specifying that the postupgrade scripts use the same\nGPG keys\
  \ as the Red Hat Upgrade Tool. As a result, postupgrade scripts downgrade\nthe selected packages\
  \ successfully. (BZ#1115532)\n\n* Previously, the Red Hat Upgrade Tool did not perform a check\
  \ whether the\nrepositories the system is being upgraded to are signed by Red Hat. This update\n\
  adds a check to the Red Hat Upgrade Tool which checks the repository signatures\nand fails\
  \ the upgrade if the packages are not signed by Red Hat. (BZ#1123915) \n\n* Previously, running\
  \ the redhat-upgrade-tool command with the \"--clean\" option\ncould fail because the Red\
  \ Hat Upgrade Tool did not check for the existence of\nthe /var/lib/systemd file. This bug\
  \ has been fixed and the \"redhat-upgrade-tool\n--clean\" command now executes successfully.\
  \ (BZ#1128162)\n\n* Previously, after an upgrade, the Red Hat Upgrade Tool did not disable\
  \ the Yum\nrepositories for the old system. This bug has been fixed and now Red Hat Upgrade\n\
  Tool correctly disables all old repositories excluding the\n/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat-upgrade-*\
  \ repositories. (BZ#1130686)\n\n* Previously, certain packages handled by the Preupgrade Assistant\
  \ utility and\nconsequently by the Red Hat Upgrade Tool had broken upgrade paths. As a\nconsequence,\
  \ these packages were not upgraded during system assessment. This\nupdate fixes the upgrade\
  \ paths and the correct files are now downloaded and\ninstalled by both tools. (BZ#1138615)\
  \ \t\n\n* Previously, when performing an upgrade over the network, if there was a\nnetwork\
  \ timeout error when downloading the .treeinfo file, the Red Hat Upgrade\nTool exited with\
  \ a traceback error. After this update, if there is a network\ntimeout, the Red Hat Upgrade\
  \ Tool returns a \"Downloading failed\" error and does\nnot produce a traceback error. (BZ#1076120)\n\
  \nUsers of redhat-upgrade-tool are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich fixes\
  \ these bugs."
