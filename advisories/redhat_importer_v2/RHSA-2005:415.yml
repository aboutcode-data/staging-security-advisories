summary: "An updated squid package that fixes several security issues is now available.\n\n\
  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response\
  \ Team.\n\nSquid is a full-featured Web proxy cache.  \n \nA race condition bug was found\
  \ in the way Squid handles the now obsolete\nSet-Cookie header. It is possible that Squid\
  \ can leak Set-Cookie header\ninformation to other clients connecting to Squid. The Common\n\
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0626\
  \ to this issue. Please note that this issue only affected Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 4. \n\
  \ \nA bug was found in the way Squid handles PUT and POST requests. It is\npossible for an\
  \ authorised remote user to cause a failed PUT or POST\nrequest which can cause Squid to crash.\
  \ The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\
  \ CAN-2005-0718 to\nthis issue.\n \nA bug was found in the way Squid processes errors in the\
  \ access control\nlist. It is possible that an error in the access control list could give\n\
  users more access than intended. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2005-1345 to this issue.\n \nA bug was found in the way Squid\
  \ handles access to the cachemgr.cgi script. \nIt is possible for an authorised remote user\
  \ to bypass access control\nlists with this flaw. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-1999-0710 to this issue.\n \nA bug was\
  \ found in the way Squid handles DNS replies.  If the port Squid\nuses for DNS requests is\
  \ not protected by a firewall it is possible for a\nremote attacker to spoof DNS replies,\
  \ possibly redirecting a user to\nspoofed or malicious content. The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-1519 to this issue.\
  \ \n \nAdditionally this update fixes the following bugs:   \n - LDAP Authentication fails\
  \ with an assertion error when using Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4 \n \nUsers of Squid should\
  \ upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues."
