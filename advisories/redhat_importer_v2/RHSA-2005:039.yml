  - CVE-2004-1185
  - CVE-2004-1186
summary: |
  An updated enscript package that fixes several security issues is now
  available.

  GNU enscript converts ASCII files to PostScript.

  Enscript has the ability to interpret special escape sequences. A flaw was
  found in the handling of the epsf command used to insert inline EPS files
  into a document. An attacker could create a carefully crafted ASCII file
  which made use of the epsf pipe command in such a way that it could execute
  arbitrary commands if the file was opened with enscript by a victim. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-1184 to this issue.

  Additional flaws in Enscript were also discovered which can only be
  triggered by executing enscript with carefully crafted command line
  arguments. These flaws therefore only have a security impact if enscript
  is executed by other programs and passed untrusted data from remote users.
  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the names CAN-2004-1185 and CAN-2004-1186 to these issues.

  All users of enscript should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues.
