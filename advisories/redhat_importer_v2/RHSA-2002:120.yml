  - CVE-2002-0378
summary: "The LPRng print spooler, as shipped in Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1,\naccepts\
  \ all remote print jobs by default. Updated LPRng packages are\navailable to fix this issue.\n\
  \nWith its default configuration, LPRng will accept job submissions from\nany host, which\
  \ is not appropriate in a workstation environment.  We\nare grateful to Matthew Caron for\
  \ pointing out this configuration\nproblem.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0378 to this issue.\n\nThe updated packages\
  \ from this advisory change the job submission\npolicy (in /etc/lpd.perms) so that jobs from\
  \ remote hosts are refused\nby default.\n\nThose running print servers may want to adjust\
  \ this policy as\nappropriate, for example to give access to certain hosts or subnets.\nFor\
  \ details on how to do this, see the lpd.perms(5) man page.\n\nPlease note that default installations\
  \ of Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1\ninclude ipchains rules blocking remote access to the\
  \ print spooler IP port;\nas a result those installations already reject remote job submissions.\
  \   \n\nNOTE: There are special instructions for installing this update at\nthe end of the\
  \ \"Solution\" section."
