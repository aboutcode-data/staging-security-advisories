  - CVE-2011-1948
summary: |
  Updated conga packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
  and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The conga packages provide a web-based administration tool for remote
  cluster and storage management.

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in luci, the conga
  web-based administration application. If a remote attacker could trick a
  user, who was logged into the luci interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's luci session. (CVE-2010-1104, CVE-2011-1948)

  These updated conga packages include several bug fixes and an enhancement.
  Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users
  are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.8 Technical Notes, linked to
  in the References, for information on the most significant of these
  changes.

  Users of conga are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add this enhancement. After installing the updated
  packages, luci must be restarted ("service luci restart") for the update to
  take effect.
