  - CVE-2012-1173
summary: |
  Updated libtiff packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
  Image File Format (TIFF) files.

  Two integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were
  found in the way libtiff attempted to allocate space for a tile in a TIFF
  image file. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted
  TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application linked against
  libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-1173)

  All libtiff users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve these issues. All running applications linked
  against libtiff must be restarted for this update to take effect.
