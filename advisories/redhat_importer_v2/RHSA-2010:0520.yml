aliases:
  - CVE-2010-1411
  - CVE-2010-2598
summary: |
  Updated libtiff packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
  Image File Format (TIFF) files.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to a buffer overflow, were
  discovered in libtiff. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
  specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application
  linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2010-1411)

  An input validation flaw was discovered in libtiff. An attacker could use
  this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would
  cause an application linked against libtiff to crash. (CVE-2010-2598)

  Red Hat would like to thank Apple Product Security for responsibly
  reporting the CVE-2010-1411 flaw, who credit Kevin Finisterre of
  digitalmunition.com for the discovery of the issue.

  All libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. All running
  applications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
