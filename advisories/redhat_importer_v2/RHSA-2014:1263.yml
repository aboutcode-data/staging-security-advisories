  - CVE-2013-2099
summary: |
  Updated glusterfs, geo-replication, and native client packages that fix one
  security issue, several bugs, and adds an enhancement are now available Red
  Hat Storage 2.1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Storage is software-only, scale-out storage that provides flexible
  and affordable unstructured data storage for an enterprise. GlusterFS, a
  key building block of Red Hat Storage, is based on a stackable user-space
  design and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads.
  GlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over network interconnections
  into one large, parallel network file system.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Python's SSL module
  implementation performed matching of certain certificate names. A remote
  attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained multiple
  wildcard characters could use this flaw to issue a request to validate such
  a certificate, resulting in excessive consumption of CPU. (CVE-2013-2099)

  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

  This update also fixes several bugs and adds an enhancement. Space
  precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are
  directed to the Red Hat Storage 2.1 Technical Notes, linked to in the
  References section, for information on the most significant of these
  changes.

  With this update, a migration script 'migrate-rhs-classic-to-rhsm', that
  applies to both Red Hat Storage Server and Red Hat Storage Console is
  provided, that enables you to have the system prepared for upgrade from the
  latest release of RHS 2.x to RHS 3.0. From the Red Hat Storage 3.0 release
  onwards, there will be a significant change made in the subscription and
  delivery mechanism from the previous Red Hat Network Classic to the new Red
  Hat Subscription Manager, and this script assists in the smooth migration.

  Users of Red Hat Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

  Note: After upgrading, it is recommend that you refer to the Knowledge Base
  articles linked to in the References section which outlines an issue with
  rebalance and file creation error that has been identified by Red Hat.
  This issue will be fixed by a subsequent update.
