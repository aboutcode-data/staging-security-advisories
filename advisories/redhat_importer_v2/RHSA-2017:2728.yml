  - CVE-2017-7547
summary: |
  An update for postgresql is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system (DBMS).

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: postgresql (9.2.23). (BZ#1484639, BZ#1484647)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that authenticating to a PostgreSQL database account with an empty password was possible despite libpq's refusal to send an empty password. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to gain access to database accounts with empty passwords. (CVE-2017-7546)

  * An authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled access to the pg_user_mappings view on foreign servers. A remote, authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to retrieve passwords from the user mappings defined by the foreign server owners without actually having the privileges to do so. (CVE-2017-7547)

  Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Ben de Graaff, Jelte Fennema, and Jeroen van der Ham as the original reporters of CVE-2017-7546; and Jeff Janes as the original reporter of CVE-2017-7547.
