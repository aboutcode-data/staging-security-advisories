summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
  content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5590,
  CVE-2013-5597, CVE-2013-5599, CVE-2013-5600, CVE-2013-5601, CVE-2013-5602)

  It was found that the Thunderbird JavaScript engine incorrectly allocated
  memory for certain functions. An attacker could combine this flaw with
  other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5595)

  A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled certain Extensible
  Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) files. An attacker could combine
  this flaw with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5604)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Dan Gohman,
  Byoungyoung Lee, Nils, and Abhishek Arya as the original reporters of these
  issues.

  Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
  HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
  They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
  viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Thunderbird 17.0.10 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 17.0.10 ESR, which corrects these issues.
  After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
  to take effect.
