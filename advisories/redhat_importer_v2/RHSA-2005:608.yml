  - CVE-2005-2700
  - CVE-2005-2728
summary: |
  Updated Apache httpd packages that correct two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular and freely-available Web server.

  A flaw was discovered in mod_ssl's handling of the "SSLVerifyClient"
  directive.  This flaw occurs if a virtual host is configured
  using "SSLVerifyClient optional" and a directive "SSLVerifyClient
  required" is set for a specific location.  For servers configured in this
  fashion, an attacker may be able to access resources that should otherwise
  be protected, by not supplying a client certificate when connecting.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name
  CAN-2005-2700 to this issue.

  A flaw was discovered in Apache httpd where the byterange filter would
  buffer certain responses into memory.  If a server has a dynamic
  resource such as a CGI script or PHP script that generates a large amount
  of data, an attacker could send carefully crafted requests in order to
  consume resources, potentially leading to a Denial of Service.  (CAN-2005-2728)

  Users of Apache httpd should update to these errata packages that contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
