  - CVE-2010-3765
summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A race condition flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled Document
  Object Model (DOM) element properties. An HTML mail message containing
  malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
  (CVE-2010-3765)

  Note: JavaScript support is disabled by default in Thunderbird. The
  CVE-2010-3765 issue is not exploitable unless JavaScript is enabled.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves this issue. All running instances of Thunderbird must be restarted
  for the update to take effect.
