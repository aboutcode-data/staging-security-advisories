summary: |
  Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1, which fixes multiple security issues, several bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that
  provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.

  Red Hat Gluster Storage's Unified File and Object Storage is built on
  OpenStack's Object Storage (swift).

  A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in OpenStack Object Storage
  (swift). By adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user
  could bypass the max_meta_count constraint, and store more metadata than
  allowed by the configuration. (CVE-2014-7960)

  Multiple flaws were found in check-mk, a plug-in for the Nagios monitoring
  system, which is used to provide monitoring and alerts for the Red Hat
  Gluster Storage network and infrastructure: a reflected cross-site
  scripting flaw due improper output encoding, a flaw that could allow
  attackers to write .mk files in arbitrary file system locations, and a flaw
  that could possibly allow remote attackers to execute code in the wato (web
  based admin) module due to the unsafe use of the pickle() function.
  (CVE-2014-5338, CVE-2014-5339, CVE-2014-5340)

  This update also fixes numerous bugs and adds various enhancements. Space
  precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are
  directed to the Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 Technical Notes, linked to in
  the References section, for information on the most significant of these
  changes.

  This advisory introduces the following new features:

  * NFS-Ganesha is now supported in highly available active-active
  environment. In a highly available active-active environment, if a
  NFS-Ganesha server that is connected to a NFS client running a particular
  application crashes, the application/NFS client is seamlessly connected to
  another NFS-Ganesha server without any administrative intervention.

  * Snapshot scheduler creates snapshots automatically based on the
  configured scheduled interval of time. The snapshots can be created every
  hour, a particular day of the month, particular month, or a particular day
  of the week.

  * You can now create a clone of a snapshot. This is a writable clone and
  behaves like a regular volume. A new volume can be created from a
  particular snapshot clone. Snapshot Clone is a technology preview feature.

  * Red Hat Gluster Storage supports network encryption using TLS/SSL.
  Red Hat Gluster Storage uses TLS/SSL for authentication and authorization,
  in place of the home grown authentication framework used for normal connections.

  * BitRot detection is a technique used in Red Hat Gluster Storage to
  identify the silent corruption of data with no indication from the disk to
  the storage software layer when the error has occurred. BitRot also helps
  in catching backend tinkering of bricks, where the data is directly
  manipulated on the bricks without going through FUSE, NFS or any other
  access protocols.

  * Glusterfind is a utility that provides the list of files that are
  modified between the previous backup session and the current period.
  This list of files can then be used by any industry standard backup
  application for backup.

  * The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) is part of the NFS v4.1 protocol
  that allows compute clients to access storage devices directly and in
  parallel. pNFS is a technology preview feature.

  * Tiering improves the performance, and the compliance aspects in a Red Hat
  Gluster Storage environment. It serves as an enabling technology for other
  enhancements by combining cost-effective or archivally oriented storage for
  the majority of user data with high-performance storage to absorb the
  majority of I/O workload. Tiering is a technology preview feature.

  All users of Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to apply this update.
