summary: "An updated cvs package that fixes several server vulnerabilities, which could\nbe\
  \ exploited by a malicious client, is now available.\n\nCVS is a version control system frequently\
  \ used to manage source code\nrepositories.\n\nWhile investigating a previously fixed vulnerability,\
  \ Derek Price\ndiscovered a flaw relating to malformed \"Entry\" lines which lead to a\nmissing\
  \ NULL terminator.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has\
  \ assigned the name CAN-2004-0414 to this issue.\n\nStefan Esser and Sebastian Krahmer conducted\
  \ an audit of CVS and fixed a\nnumber of issues that may have had security consequences.\n\
  \nAmong the issues deemed likely to be exploitable were: \n\n-- a double-free relating to\
  \ the error_prog_name string (CAN-2004-0416)\n-- an argument integer overflow (CAN-2004-0417)\n\
  -- out-of-bounds writes in serv_notify (CAN-2004-0418).\n\nAn attacker who has access to a\
  \ CVS server may be able to execute arbitrary\ncode under the UID on which the CVS server\
  \ is executing. \n\nUsers of CVS are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains\n\
  backported patches correcting these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Esser, Sebastian\
  \ Krahmer, and Derek\nPrice for auditing, disclosing, and providing patches for these issues."
