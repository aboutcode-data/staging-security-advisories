summary: |
  Updated subversion packages that fix three security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables one
  or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a hierarchy of
  files and directories while keeping a history of all changes. The
  mod_dav_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to allow access to
  Subversion repositories via HTTP.

  An access restriction bypass flaw was found in the mod_dav_svn module. If
  the SVNPathAuthz directive was set to "short_circuit", certain access rules
  were not enforced, possibly allowing sensitive repository data to be leaked
  to remote users. Note that SVNPathAuthz is set to "On" by default.
  (CVE-2010-3315)

  A server-side memory leak was found in the Subversion server. If a
  malicious, remote user performed "svn blame" or "svn log" operations on
  certain repository files, it could cause the Subversion server to consume
  a large amount of system memory. (CVE-2010-4644)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the mod_dav_svn module
  processed certain requests. If a malicious, remote user issued a certain
  type of request to display a collection of Subversion repositories on a
  host that has the SVNListParentPath directive enabled, it could cause the
  httpd process serving the request to crash. Note that SVNListParentPath is
  not enabled by default. (CVE-2010-4539)

  All Subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the Subversion server must be restarted for the update
  to take effect: restart httpd if you are using mod_dav_svn, or restart
  svnserve if it is used.
