summary: |
  An update for icedtea-web is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the plug-in and Web Start implementations. IcedTea-Web now also contains PolicyEditor - a simple tool to configure Java policies.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: icedtea-web (1.6.2). (BZ#1275523)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that IcedTea-Web did not properly sanitize applet URLs when storing applet trust settings. A malicious web page could use this flaw to inject trust-settings configuration, and cause applets to be executed without user approval. (CVE-2015-5234)

  * It was discovered that IcedTea-Web did not properly determine an applet's origin when asking the user if the applet should be run. A malicious page could use this flaw to cause IcedTea-Web to execute the applet without user approval, or confuse the user into approving applet execution based on an incorrectly indicated applet origin. (CVE-2015-5235)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andrea Palazzo (Truel IT) for reporting these issues.
