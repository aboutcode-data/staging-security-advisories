aliases:
  - CVE-2011-2908
summary: |
  An update for the JMX Console in JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 that
  fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  It was found that the JMX Console did not protect against Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
  who was logged into the JMX Console, into visiting a specially-crafted URL,
  the attacker could perform operations on MBeans, which may lead to
  arbitrary code execution in the context of the JBoss server process.
  (CVE-2011-2908)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
