  - CVE-2008-1677
summary: |
  An updated redhat-ds package that addresses a security issue is now
  available as Red Hat Directory Server 7.1, Service Pack 6.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Red Hat Directory Server 7.1
  regular expression handler. An unauthenticated attacker could construct a
  malicious LDAP query that could cause the LDAP server to crash or possibly
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-1677)

  For more information about Service Pack 6, including upgrade and
  installation instructions for users running Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 on
  Solaris, please refer to the Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 SP6 release
  notes, available at:

  http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/release-notes/7.1SP6/

  All users of Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 should upgrade to Service Pack 6,
  which resolves this issue.
