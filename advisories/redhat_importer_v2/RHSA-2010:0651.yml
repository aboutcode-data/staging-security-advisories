summary: |
  An updated spice-xpi package that fixes two security issues and three bugs
  is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing
  virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
  hypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.

  The spice-xpi package provides a plug-in that allows the SPICE client to
  run from within Mozilla Firefox.

  A race condition was found in the way the SPICE Firefox plug-in and the
  SPICE client communicated. A local attacker could use this flaw to trick
  the plug-in and the SPICE client into communicating over an
  attacker-controlled socket, possibly gaining access to authentication
  details, or resulting in a man-in-the-middle attack on the SPICE
  connection. (CVE-2010-2792)

  It was found that the SPICE Firefox plug-in used a predictable name for its
  log file. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct a symbolic link
  attack, allowing them to overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2010-2794)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * a bug prevented users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, with all updates
  applied, from running the SPICE Firefox plug-in when using Firefox 3.6.4.
  With this update, the plug-in works correctly with Firefox 3.6.4 and the
  latest version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, Firefox 3.6.7. (BZ#618244)

  * unused code has been removed during source code refactoring. This also
  resolves a bug in the SPICE Firefox plug-in that caused it to close random
  file descriptors. (BZ#594006, BZ#619067)

  Note: This update should be installed together with the RHSA-2010:0632
  qspice-client update: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0632.html

  Users of spice-xpi should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,
  Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
