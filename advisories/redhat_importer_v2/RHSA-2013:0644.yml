aliases:
  - CVE-2012-5633
  - CVE-2013-0239
summary: |
  An updated apache-cxf package for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.0.1 which fixes two security issues is now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache CXF is an open source services framework.

  It was found that the Apache CXF UsernameTokenPolicyValidator and
  UsernameTokenInterceptor allowed a UsernameToken element with no password
  child element to bypass authentication. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to circumvent access controls applied to web services by omitting the
  password in a UsernameToken. This flaw was exploitable on web services that
  rely on WS-SecurityPolicy plain text UsernameTokens to authenticate users.
  It was not exploitable when using hashed passwords or WS-Security without
  WS-SecurityPolicy. (CVE-2013-0239)

  If web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor
  enabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these
  services were always granted access, without applying authentication
  checks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing
  REST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple
  SOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints
  applied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if
  WSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that
  use WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are advised to upgrade to this updated package.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
