summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2014-1477, CVE-2014-1482, CVE-2014-1486)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error messages related to web
  workers. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin policy,
  which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or could
  potentially be used to gather authentication tokens and other data from
  third-party websites. (CVE-2014-1487)

  A flaw was found in the implementation of System Only Wrappers (SOW).
  An attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox. When combined with other
  vulnerabilities, this flaw could have additional security implications.
  (CVE-2014-1479)

  It was found that the Firefox JavaScript engine incorrectly handled window
  objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass certain security
  checks and possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-1481)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary
  Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sotaro
  Ikeda, Cody Crews, Fredrik "Flonka" Lönnqvist, Arthur Gerkis, Masato
  Kinugawa, and Boris Zbarsky as the original reporters of these issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 24.3.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 24.3.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
