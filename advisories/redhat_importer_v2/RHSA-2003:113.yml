  - CVE-2003-0084
summary: "Updated mod_auth_any packages are now available for Red Hat Linux.\n\nmod_auth_any\
  \ is a Web server module that allows the Apache httpd server to\ncall arbitrary external programs\
  \ to verify user passwords.\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the way mod_auth_any escapes\
  \ shell\narguments when calling external programs. Versions of mod_auth_any included\nin Red\
  \ Hat Linux 7.2 and 7.3 are affected.  These vulnerabilities\nallow remote attackers to run\
  \ arbitrary commands as the user under which\nthe Web server is running.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0084 to these issues.\n\
  \nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which address\nthese vulnerabilities\
  \ by changing the method by which external programs are\ninvoked.\n\nNote: This updated module\
  \ is more careful in checking the results of the\nAuthAnyUserProg. Previous versions did not\
  \ distinguish between the program\noutputting nothing due to success or a crash.  This replacement\
  \ version\ntreats a zero-length result as if it were an \"Authentication Error,\" and\nexpects\
  \ the program to output a valid username on success.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel\
  \ Jarboe and Maneesh Sahani for bringing\nthese issues to our attention."
