  - CVE-2007-1349
summary: |
  Red Hat Network Proxy Server version 5.1.1 is now available. This update
  includes a fix for a security issue in a Red Hat Network Proxy Server
  component.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The Red Hat Network Proxy Server 5.1.1 release corrects a security
  vulnerability in a shipped component. In a typical operating environment,
  this component is not exposed to users of Proxy Server in a vulnerable
  manner. This security update will reduce risk in unique Proxy Server
  environments.

  A flaw was found in the mod_perl "ModPerl::RegistryCooker" class. If a
  server implemented a mod_perl registry module using the
  "namespace_from_uri" method, a remote attacker requesting a carefully
  crafted URI can cause resource consumption, which could lead to a denial of
  service. (CVE-2007-1349)

  Users of Red Hat Network Proxy Server 5.1 are advised to upgrade to 5.1.1,
  which resolves this issue.
