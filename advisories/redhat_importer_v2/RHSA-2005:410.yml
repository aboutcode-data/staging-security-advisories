  - CVE-2005-0372
summary: |
  An updated gFTP package that fixes a directory traversal issue is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  gFTP is a multi-threaded FTP client for the X Window System.

  A directory traversal bug was found in gFTP. If a user can be tricked into
  downloading a file from a malicious ftp server, it is possible to overwrite
  arbitrary files owned by the victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0372 to
  this issue.

  Users of gftp should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported fix for this issue.
