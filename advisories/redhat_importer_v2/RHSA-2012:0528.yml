  - CVE-2011-3620
summary: |
  Updated Messaging packages that resolve one security issue, fix multiple
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  MRG 2.1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
  based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
  standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
  messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
  messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
  vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
  client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
  libraries and management tools.

  It was found that Qpid accepted any password or SASL mechanism, provided
  the remote user knew a valid cluster username. This could give a remote
  attacker unauthorized access to the cluster, exposing cluster messages and
  internal Qpid/MRG configurations. (CVE-2011-3620)

  Note: If you are using an ACL, the cluster-username must be allowed to
  publish to the qpid.cluster-credentials exchange. For example, if your
  cluster-username is "foo", in your ACL file:

  acl allow foo@QPID publish exchange name=qpid.cluster-credentials

  The CVE-2011-3620 fix changes the cluster initialization protocol. As such,
  the cluster with all new version brokers must be restarted for the changes
  to take effect. Refer below for details.

  These updated packages provide numerous enhancements and bug fixes for the
  Messaging component of MRG. Space precludes documenting all of these
  changes in this advisory. Documentation for these changes will be available
  shortly in the Technical Notes document linked to in the References
  section.

  All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.1 are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and
  add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes.
  After installing the updated packages, stop the cluster by either running
  "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or "qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one
  of the cluster nodes. Once stopped, restart the cluster with
  "service qpidd start" on all nodes for the update to take effect.
