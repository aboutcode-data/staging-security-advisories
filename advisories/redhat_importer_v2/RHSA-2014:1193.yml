  - CVE-2014-3596
summary: |
  Updated axis packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Apache Axis is an implementation of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).
  It can be used to build both web service clients and servers.

  It was discovered that Axis incorrectly extracted the host name from an
  X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially
  crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3596)

  For additional information on this flaw, refer to the Knowledgebase article
  in the References section.

  This issue was discovered by David Jorm and Arun Neelicattu of Red Hat
  Product Security.

  All axis users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. Applications using Apache
  Axis must be restarted for this update to take effect.
