  - CVE-2013-6492
summary: |
  An updated piranha package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Piranha provides high-availability and load-balancing services for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux. The piranha packages contain various tools to administer
  and configure the Linux Virtual Server (LVS), as well as the heartbeat and
  failover components. LVS is a dynamically-adjusted kernel routing mechanism
  that provides load balancing, primarily for Web and FTP servers.

  It was discovered that the Piranha Configuration Tool did not properly
  restrict access to its web pages. A remote attacker able to connect to the
  Piranha Configuration Tool web server port could use this flaw to read or
  modify the LVS configuration without providing valid administrative
  credentials. (CVE-2013-6492)

  All piranha users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
