summary: |
  An updated version of Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) is now
  available. RHUI 4.11.3 resolves several security vulnerabilities.

  Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) provides a highly scalable and redundant framework for managing repositories and content. It also allows cloud providers to deliver content and updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instances.

  Security Fixes:

  Python-urllib3: Unbounded decompression chain leads to resource exhaustion (CVE-2025-66418)
  Python-urllib3: urllib3 vulnerable to decompression-bomb safeguard bypass when following HTTP redirects (CVE-2026-21441)
  Python-urllib3: urllib3 Streaming API improperly handles highly compressed data (CVE-2025-66471)

  This update addresses several vulnerabilities within the urllib3 library pertaining to the handling of compressed content (e.g., gzip, deflate, br, or zstd). A remote attacker could potentially provide specially crafted content that, when processed, leads to excessive CPU utilization and significant memory allocation during decompression, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

  Deployment Notes:

  * RHUA nodes: The updated python3-urllib3 package provided in this errata is intended specifically for Red Hat Update Appliance (RHUA) nodes.

  * CDS nodes: Content Delivery Server (CDS) nodes should receive the corresponding update directly from the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distribution channels.

  Impact Assessment:

  Under standard operating conditions, a properly secured RHUI environment is not expected to be impacted by these vulnerabilities, as the RHUA typically communicates only with trusted endpoints. However, as a matter of security best practice, all RHUI administrators are strongly advised to apply this update to mitigate potential risks.
