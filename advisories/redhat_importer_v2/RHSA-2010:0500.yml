summary: |
  An updated firefox package that addresses security issues, fixes bugs, adds
  numerous enhancements, and upgrades Firefox to version 3.6.4, is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2010-1121, CVE-2010-1200, CVE-2010-1202, CVE-2010-1203)

  A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
  a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
  in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2010-1198)

  Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
  web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Firefox. (CVE-2010-1196, CVE-2010-1199)

  A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
  malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
  such as usernames and passwords. (CVE-2010-1125)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
  attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
  also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
  "Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
  displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
  to users. (CVE-2010-1197)

  A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
  be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
  websites. (CVE-2008-5913)

  A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
  Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
  loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
  certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
  add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
  document. (CVE-2010-0182)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 3.6.4. You can find a link to the Mozilla advisories
  in the References section of this erratum.

  This erratum upgrades Firefox from version 3.0.19 to version 3.6.4, and as
  such, contains multiple bug fixes and numerous enhancements. Space
  precludes documenting these changes in this advisory. For details
  concerning these changes, refer to the Firefox Release Notes links in the
  References section of this erratum.

  Important: Firefox 3.6.4 is not completely backwards-compatible with all
  Mozilla Add-ons and Firefox plug-ins that worked with Firefox 3.0.19.
  Firefox 3.6 checks compatibility on first-launch, and, depending on the
  individual configuration and the installed Add-ons and plug-ins, may
  disable said Add-ons and plug-ins, or attempt to check for updates and
  upgrade them. Add-ons and plug-ins may have to be manually updated.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  Firefox version 3.6.4. After installing the update, Firefox must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
