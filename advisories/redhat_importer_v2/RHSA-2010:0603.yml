  - CVE-2010-2547
summary: |
  An updated gnupg2 package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a tool for encrypting data and
  creating digital signatures, compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet
  standard and the S/MIME standard.

  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way gpgsm, a Cryptographic Message
  Syntax (CMS) encryption and signing tool, handled X.509 certificates with
  a large number of Subject Alternate Names. A specially-crafted X.509
  certificate could, when imported, cause gpgsm to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-2547)

  All gnupg2 users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
