summary: |
  Updated glibc packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The glibc packages contain the standard C libraries used by multiple
  programs on the system. These packages contain the standard C and the
  standard math libraries. Without these two libraries, a Linux system cannot
  function properly.

  The fix for CVE-2010-3847 introduced a regression in the way the dynamic
  loader expanded the $ORIGIN dynamic string token specified in the RPATH and
  RUNPATH entries in the ELF library header. A local attacker could use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges via a setuid or setgid program using
  such a library. (CVE-2011-0536)

  It was discovered that the glibc fnmatch() function did not properly
  restrict the use of alloca(). If the function was called on sufficiently
  large inputs, it could cause an application using fnmatch() to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
  (CVE-2011-1071)

  It was discovered that the locale command did not produce properly escaped
  output as required by the POSIX specification. If an attacker were able to
  set the locale environment variables in the environment of a script that
  performed shell evaluation on the output of the locale command, and that
  script were run with different privileges than the attacker's, it could
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the script. (CVE-2011-1095)

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
