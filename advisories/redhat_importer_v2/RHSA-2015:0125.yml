summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.7.0, which fixes multiple security
  issues, various bugs, and adds enhancements, is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications.

  This release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit
  2.6.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 2.7.0 Release
  Notes for information on the most significant of these changes, available
  shortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/

  This release also fixes the following security issues:

  It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted host name from
  an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially
  crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

  Note: For additional information on these two flaws, refer to the
  Knowledgebase article in the References section.

  It was found that external parameter entities were not disabled when the
  resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false.
  A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could
  use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2014-3490)

  It was discovered that the implementation of
  org.hibernate.validator.util.ReflectionHelper together with the permissions
  required to run Hibernate Validator under the Java Security Manager could
  allow a malicious application deployed in the same application container to
  execute several actions with escalated privileges, which might otherwise
  not be possible. This flaw could be used to perform various attacks,
  including but not restricted to, arbitrary code execution in systems that
  are otherwise secured by the Java Security Manager. (CVE-2014-3558)

  The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
  Security, and the CVE-2014-3490 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red
  Hat Product Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.6.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Framework
  Kit 2.7.0.
