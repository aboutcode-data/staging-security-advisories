  - CVE-2007-3410
summary: |
  An updated HelixPlayer package that fixes a buffer overflow flaw is now
  available.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  HelixPlayer is a media player.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way HelixPlayer processed
  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) files. It was possible
  for a malformed SMIL file to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
  the user running HelixPlayer. (CVE-2007-3410)

  All users of HelixPlayer are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.
