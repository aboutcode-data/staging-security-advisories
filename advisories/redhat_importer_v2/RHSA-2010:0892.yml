summary: |
  Updated openswan packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Openswan is a free implementation of Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
  and Internet Key Exchange (IKE). IPsec uses strong cryptography to provide
  both authentication and encryption services. These services allow you to
  build secure tunnels through untrusted networks.

  Two buffer overflow flaws were found in the Openswan client-side XAUTH
  handling code used when connecting to certain Cisco gateways. A malicious
  or compromised VPN gateway could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code
  on the connecting Openswan client. (CVE-2010-3302, CVE-2010-3308)

  Two input sanitization flaws were found in the Openswan client-side
  handling of Cisco gateway banners. A malicious or compromised VPN gateway
  could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code on the connecting Openswan
  client. (CVE-2010-3752, CVE-2010-3753)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Openswan project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges D. Hugh Redelmeier and Paul Wouters as the
  original reporters.

  All users of openswan are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
  this update, the ipsec service will be restarted automatically.
