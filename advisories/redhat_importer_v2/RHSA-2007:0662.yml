  - CVE-2007-3304
summary: "Updated Apache httpd packages that correct a security issue are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web\
  \ server. \n\nThe Apache HTTP Server did not verify that a process was an Apache child\nprocess\
  \ before sending it signals. A local attacker with the ability to run\nscripts on the Apache\
  \ HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and cause\narbitrary processes to be terminated\
  \ which could lead to a denial of\nservice.  (CVE-2007-3304).\n\nUsers of httpd should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct this issue. Users\
  \ should restart Apache\nafter installing this update."
