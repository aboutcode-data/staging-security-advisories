summary: "Updated ethereal packages are available which fix several security problems.\n\nEthereal\
  \ is a package designed for monitoring network traffic on your\nsystem.  Several security\
  \ issues have been found in the Ethereal packages\ndistributed with Red Hat Linux Advanced\
  \ Server:\n\nBuffer overflow in Ethereal 0.9.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to\ncause\
  \ a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via the ISIS dissector.\n(CAN-2002-0834) \n\
  \nBuffer overflows in Ethereal 0.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers\nto cause a denial\
  \ of service or execute arbitrary code via (1) the BGP\ndissector, or (2) the WCP dissector.\
  \ (CAN-2002-0821)\n\nEthereal 0.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial\n\
  of service and possibly excecute arbitrary code via the (1) SOCKS, (2)\nRSVP, (3) AFS, or\
  \ (4) LMP dissectors, which can be caused to core\ndump (CAN-2002-0822)\n\nA buffer overflow\
  \ in the X11 dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial\
  \ of service (crash) and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code while Ethereal is parsing keysyms.\
  \ (CAN-2002-0402)\n\nThe DNS dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.4 allows remote attackers to\n\
  cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed packet\nthat causes Ethereal to\
  \ enter an infinite loop. (CAN-2002-0403)\n\nA vulnerability in the GIOP dissector in Ethereal\
  \ before 0.9.4 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).\n\
  (CAN-2002-0404) \n\nUsers of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal\n\
  version 0.9.6 which is not vulnerable to these issues."
