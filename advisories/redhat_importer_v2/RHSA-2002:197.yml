  Updated glibc packages are available to fix a buffer overflow in the

  The GNU C library package, glibc, contains standard libraries used by
  multiple programs on the system.

  A read buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the glibc resolver code in
  versions of glibc up to and including 2.2.5.  The vulnerability is
  triggered by DNS packets larger than 1024 bytes and can cause applications
  to crash.
