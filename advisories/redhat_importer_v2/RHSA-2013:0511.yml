  - CVE-2012-4543
summary: "Updated pki-core packages that fix multiple security issues, two bugs, and\nadd various\
  \ enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response\
  \ Team has rated this update as having moderate\nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\
  \ CVE link in\nthe References section.\n\nRed Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software\
  \ system designed to\nmanage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. PKI Core\n\
  contains fundamental packages required by Red Hat Certificate System, which\ncomprise the\
  \ Certificate Authority (CA) subsystem.\n\nNote: The Certificate Authority component provided\
  \ by this advisory cannot\nbe used as a standalone server. It is installed and operates as\
  \ a part of\nIdentity Management (the IPA component) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nMultiple\
  \ cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in Certificate System.\nAn attacker could use\
  \ these flaws to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS)\nattack against victims using Certificate\
  \ System's web interface.\n(CVE-2012-4543)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\
  \n* Previously, due to incorrect conversion of large integers while\ngenerating a new serial\
  \ number, some of the most significant bits in the\nserial number were truncated. Consequently,\
  \ the serial number generated for\ncertificates was sometimes smaller than expected and this\
  \ incorrect\nconversion in turn led to a collision if a certificate with the smaller\nnumber\
  \ already existed in the database. This update removes the incorrect\ninteger conversion so\
  \ that no serial numbers are truncated. As a result,\nthe installation wizard proceeds as\
  \ expected. (BZ#841663)\n\n* The certificate authority used a different profile for issuing\
  \ the audit\ncertificate than it used for renewing it. The issuing profile was for two\nyears,\
  \ and the renewal was for six months. They should both be for two\nyears. This update sets\
  \ the default and constraint parameters in the\ncaSignedLogCert.cfg audit certificate renewal\
  \ profile to two years.\n(BZ#844459)\n\nThis update also adds the following enhancements:\n\
  \n* IPA (Identity, Policy and Audit) now provides an improved way to\ndetermine that PKI is\
  \ up and ready to service requests. Checking the\nservice status was not sufficient. This\
  \ update creates a mechanism for\nclients to determine that the PKI subsystem is up using\
  \ the getStatus()\nfunction to query the cs.startup_state in CS.cfg. (BZ#858864)\n\n* This\
  \ update increases the default root CA validity period from eight\nyears to twenty years.\
  \ (BZ#891985) \n\nAll users of pki-core are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\n\
  which fix these issues and add these enhancements."
