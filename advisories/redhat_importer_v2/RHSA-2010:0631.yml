summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  [Updated 18 August 2010]
  The CVE-2010-2240 description has been updated to reflect that the issue
  affects both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. No changes have been made to the
  packages.

  These packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating
  system.

  Security fixes:

  * unsafe sprintf() use in the Bluetooth implementation. Creating a large
  number of Bluetooth L2CAP, SCO, or RFCOMM sockets could result in arbitrary
  memory pages being overwritten, allowing a local, unprivileged user to
  cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-1084,
  Important)

  * a flaw in the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation implementation,
  allowing a remote attacker to send a specially-crafted ISO MPEG-2 Transport
  Stream frame to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-1086, Important)

  * NULL pointer dereference in nfs_wb_page_cancel(), allowing a local user
  on a system that has an NFS-mounted file system to cause a denial of
  service or escalate their privileges on that system. (CVE-2010-1087,
  Important)

  * flaw in sctp_process_unk_param(), allowing a remote attacker to send a
  specially-crafted SCTP packet to an SCTP listening port on a target system,
  causing a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1173, Important)

  * race condition between finding a keyring by name and destroying a freed
  keyring in the key management facility, allowing a local, unprivileged
  user to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2010-1437, Important)

  * systems using the kernel NFS server to export a shared memory file system
  and that have the sysctl overcommit_memory variable set to never overcommit
  (a value of 2; by default, it is set to 0), may experience a NULL pointer
  dereference, allowing a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of
  service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2008-7256, CVE-2010-1643,
  Important)

  * when an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently
  overwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault
  occurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2010-2240, Important)

  * flaw in CIFSSMBWrite() could allow a remote attacker to send a
  specially-crafted SMB response packet to a target CIFS client, resulting in
  a denial of service. (CVE-2010-2248, Important)

  * buffer overflow flaws in the kernel's implementation of the server-side
  XDR for NFSv4 could allow an attacker on the local network to send a
  specially-crafted large compound request to the NFSv4 server, possibly
  resulting in a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2010-2521,
  Important)

  * NULL pointer dereference in the firewire-ohci driver used for OHCI
  compliant IEEE 1394 controllers could allow a local, unprivileged user with
  access to /dev/fw* files to issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a denial of
  service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are blacklisted by
  default. If enabled, only root has access to the files noted above by
  default. (CVE-2009-4138, Moderate)

  * flaw in the link_path_walk() function. Using the file descriptor
  returned by open() with the O_NOFOLLOW flag on a subordinate NFS-mounted
  file system, could result in a NULL pointer dereference, causing a denial
  of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-1088, Moderate)

  * memory leak in release_one_tty() could allow a local, unprivileged user
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-1162, Moderate)

  * information leak in the USB implementation. Certain USB errors could
  result in an uninitialized kernel buffer being sent to user-space. An
  attacker with physical access to a target system could use this flaw to
  cause an information leak. (CVE-2010-1083, Low)
