  - CVE-2016-0718
summary: |
  An update for expat is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Expat is a C library for parsing XML documents.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way Expat processed certain input. A remote attacker could send specially crafted XML that, when parsed by an application using the Expat library, would cause that application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-0718)

  Red Hat would like to thank Gustavo Grieco for reporting this issue.
