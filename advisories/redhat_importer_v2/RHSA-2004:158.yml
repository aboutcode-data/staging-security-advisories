aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0179
summary: |
  An updated cadaver package that fixes a vulnerability in neon exploitable
  by a malicious DAV server is now available.

  cadaver is a command-line WebDAV client that uses inbuilt code from neon,
  an HTTP and WebDAV client library.

  Versions of the neon client library up to and including 0.24.4 have been
  found to contain a number of format string bugs.  An attacker could create
  a malicious WebDAV server in such a way as to allow arbitrary code
  execution on the client should a user connect to it using cadaver.  The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2004-0179 to this issue.

  Users of cadaver are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a patch correcting this issue.
