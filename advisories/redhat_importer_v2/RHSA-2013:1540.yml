  - CVE-2013-4166
summary: |
  Updated evolution packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Evolution is the integrated collection of email, calendaring, contact
  management, communications, and personal information management (PIM) tools
  for the GNOME desktop environment.

  A flaw was found in the way Evolution selected GnuPG public keys when
  encrypting emails. This could result in emails being encrypted with public
  keys other than the one belonging to the intended recipient.
  (CVE-2013-4166)

  The Evolution packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.32.3, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  These changes include implementation of Gnome XDG Config Folders, and
  support for Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocol to connect to Microsoft
  Exchange servers. EWS support has been added as a part of the
  evolution-exchange packages. (BZ#883010, BZ#883014, BZ#883015, BZ#883017,
  BZ#524917, BZ#524921, BZ#883044)

  The gtkhtml3 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.32.2, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#883019)

  The libgdata packages have been upgraded to upstream version 0.6.4, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#883032)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The Exchange Calendar could not fetch the "Free" and "Busy" information
  for meeting attendees when using Microsoft Exchange 2010 servers, and this
  information thus could not be displayed. This happened because Microsoft
  Exchange 2010 servers use more strict rules for "Free" and "Busy"
  information fetching. With this update, the respective code in the
  openchange packages has been modified so the "Free" and "Busy" information
  fetching now complies with the fetching rules on Microsoft Exchange 2010
  servers. The "Free" and "Busy" information can now be displayed as expected
  in the Exchange Calendar. (BZ#665967)

  All Evolution users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements. All running instances of Evolution must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
