  https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2122

  Space precludes documenting all of the container images in this advisory. See the following Release Notes documentation, which will be updated shortly for this release, for details about these changes:

  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/release_notes/ocp-4-7-release-notes.html

  This update fixes the following bug among others:

  * Previously, resources for the ClusterOperator were being created early in the update process, which led to update failures when the ClusterOperator had no status condition while Operators were updating. This bug fix changes the timing of when these resources are created. As a result, updates can take place without errors. (BZ#1959238)

  Security Fix(es):

  * gogo/protobuf: plugin/unmarshal/unmarshal.go lacks certain index validation (CVE-2021-3121)
