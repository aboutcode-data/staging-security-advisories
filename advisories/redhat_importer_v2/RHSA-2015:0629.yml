summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for the little-endian 64-bit PowerPC platform architecture
  (ppc64le) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2015-0836, CVE-2015-0831, CVE-2015-0827)

  An information leak flaw was found in the way Firefox implemented
  autocomplete forms. An attacker able to trick a user into specifying a
  local file in the form could use this flaw to access the contents of that
  file. (CVE-2015-0822)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de
  Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron Campen, Tom Schuster, Ryan VanderMeulen, Paul
  Bandha, Abhishek Arya, and Armin Razmdjou as the original reporters of
  these issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 31.5.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 31.5.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
