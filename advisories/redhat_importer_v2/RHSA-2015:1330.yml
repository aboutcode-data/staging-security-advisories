summary: |
  Updated python packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs
  and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
  often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme, or Java. Python includes modules,
  classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and dynamic typing.
  Python supports interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as
  to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac and MFC).

  It was discovered that the socket.recvfrom_into() function failed to check
  the size of the supplied buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow when
  the function was called with an insufficiently sized buffer.
  (CVE-2014-1912)

  It was discovered that multiple Python standard library modules
  implementing network protocols (such as httplib or smtplib) failed to
  restrict the sizes of server responses. A malicious server could cause a
  client using one of the affected modules to consume an excessive amount of
  memory. (CVE-2013-1752)

  It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module incorrectly handled URL
  encoded paths. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute scripts
  outside of the cgi-bin directory, or disclose the source code of the
  scripts in the cgi-bin directory. (CVE-2014-4650)

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the buffer() function handled
  its offset and size arguments. An attacker able to control these arguments
  could use this flaw to disclose portions of the application memory or cause
  it to crash. (CVE-2014-7185)

  These updated python packages also include numerous bug fixes and
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. For information on the most significant of these changes, users
  are directed to the following article on the Red Hat Customer Portal:

  https://access.redhat.com/articles/1495363

  All python users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement.
