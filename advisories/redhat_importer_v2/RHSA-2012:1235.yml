  - CVE-2012-3515
summary: |
  Updated kvm packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built
  for the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

  A flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences
  when emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to
  write to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual
  console back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the
  host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)

  This flaw did not affect the default use of KVM. Affected configurations
  were:

  * When guests were started from the command line ("/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm"),
  and without specifying a serial or parallel device that specifically does
  not use a virtual console (vc) back-end. (Note that Red Hat does not
  support invoking "qemu-kvm" from the command line on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.)

  * Guests that were managed via libvirt, such as when using Virtual Machine
  Manager (virt-manager), but that have a serial or parallel device that uses
  a virtual console back-end. By default, guests managed via libvirt will not
  use a virtual console back-end for such devices.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.

  All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this
  issue. Note: The procedure in the Solution section must be performed before
  this update will take effect.
