summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 roll up patch 1, which fixes multiple
  security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise SOA
  Platform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security
  issues are also fixed with this release:

  If web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor
  enabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these
  services were always granted access, without applying authentication
  checks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing
  REST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple
  SOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints
  applied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if
  WSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that
  use WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)

  It was found that Apache CXF was vulnerable to SOAPAction spoofing attacks
  under certain conditions. If web services were exposed via Apache CXF that
  use a unique SOAPAction for each service operation, then a remote attacker
  could perform SOAPAction spoofing to call a forbidden operation if it
  accepts the same parameters as an allowed operation. WS-Policy validation
  was performed against the operation being invoked, and an attack must pass
  validation to be successful. (CVE-2012-3451)

  Multiple weaknesses were found in the JBoss Web DIGEST authentication
  implementation, effectively reducing the security normally provided by
  DIGEST authentication. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform
  replay attacks in some circumstances. (CVE-2012-5885, CVE-2012-5886,
  CVE-2012-5887)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting
  CVE-2012-3451.

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  SOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
