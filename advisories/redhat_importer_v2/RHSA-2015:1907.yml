summary: |
  Updated jboss-ec2-eap packages that fix three security issues, several
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was discovered that sending requests containing large headers to the Web
  Console produced a Java OutOfMemoryError in the HTTP management interface.
  An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2015-5220)

  It was discovered that the EAP Management Console could be opened in an
  IFRAME, which made it possible to intercept and manipulate requests.
  An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into performing arbitrary
  actions in the Console (clickjacking). (CVE-2015-5178)

  Note: Resolving this issue required a change in the way http requests are
  sent in the Console; this change may affect users. See the Release Notes
  linked to in the References section for details about this change.

  It was discovered that when uploading a file using a multipart/form-data
  submission to the EAP Web Console, the Console was vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF). This meant that an attacker could use the flaw
  together with a forgery attack to make changes to an authenticated
  instance. (CVE-2015-5188)

  The CVE-2015-5220 issue was discovered by Aaron Ogburn of Red Hat GSS
  Middleware Team, and the CVE-2015-5188 issue was discovered by Jason Greene
  of the Red Hat Middleware Engineering Team.

  * The jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic
  Compute Cloud (EC2). With this update, the packages have been updated to
  ensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.4.4. Documentation for these changes is available from the link in the
  References section.

  All jboss-ec2-eap users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
