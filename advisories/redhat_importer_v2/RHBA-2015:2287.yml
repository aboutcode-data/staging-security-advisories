summary: |
  Updated setroubleshoot packages that fix several bugs and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The setroubleshoot packages contain a set of analysis plug-ins for use with the setroubleshoot utility. Each plug-in has the capacity to analyze SELinux Access Vector Cache (AVC) data, as well as system data, to provide user-friendly reports that describe how to interpret SELinux AVC denial messages.

  The setroubleshoot packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.2.24, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. Notably, setroubleshoot now runs under the setroubleshoot user instead of the root user. (BZ#1212422)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * With this update, Bugzilla bug reports generated by the setroubleshoot utility include a version of the selinux-policy package. (BZ#1163346)

  Users of setroubleshoot are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs and add these enhancements.
