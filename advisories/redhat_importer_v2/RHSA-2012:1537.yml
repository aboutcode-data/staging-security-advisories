  - CVE-2009-2625
summary: |
  An updated jasperreports-server-pro package that fixes one security issue
  and various bugs is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JasperReports Server is a reporting server.

  A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
  SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
  Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
  hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Adding a user to any ROLE caused an unexpected exception. (BZ#730712)

  * Previously, the jasperreports-server-pro RPM spec file contained the
  "%{dist}" tag on the "Release" line. To comply with the packaging and
  naming guidelines, the tag has been changed to "%{?dist}" with this update.
  (BZ#868927)

  * In some cases reports were opened with an incorrect list of
  Entity/Entities. (BZ#842687)

  Note: The jasperreports-server-pro package replaces rhevm-reports-server
  from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0.

  Users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these
  issues.
