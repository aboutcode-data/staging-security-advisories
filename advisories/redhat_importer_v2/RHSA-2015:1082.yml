aliases:
  - CVE-2015-1421
  - CVE-2015-1805
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP
  implementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT
  collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,
  Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read
  and write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were
  already processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,
  potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array
  overrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system
  or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,
  Important)

  The CVE-2015-1421 issue was discovered by Sun Baoliang of Red Hat, and the
  security impact of the CVE-2015-1805 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
