  - CVE-2018-10855
summary: "An update for ansible is now available for Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.4 for RHEL 7.\n\
  \nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate.\
  \ A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity\
  \ rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\
  \nAnsible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task\
  \ execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to\
  \ be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred\
  \ to managed machines automatically.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a newer\
  \ upstream version: ansible (2.4.5)\n\nSecurity fix(es):\n\n* ansible: Ansible through version\
  \ 2.5 does not properly honour the no_log option with failed task iterations. When a list\
  \ of secret items is supplied to a task and a task iteration fails, secrets can be disclosed\
  \ in logs despite the no_log option being enabled. (CVE-2018-10855)\n\nRed Hat would like\
  \ to thank Tobias Henkel (BMW Car IT GmbH) for reporting these issues.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n\
  * Fixed win_copy to preserve the global Ansible local tmp path instead of\n  deleting it when\
  \ dealing with multiple files\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37964)\n\n* Fixed\
  \ Windows setup.ps1 for slow performance in large domain environments\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38646)\n\
  \n* Fixed eos_logging idempotency issue when trying to set both logging \n  destination &\
  \ facility\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40604)\n\n* Fixed ios_logging idempotency\
  \ issue when trying to set both logging \n  destination & facility\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41076)\n\
  \nSee https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.4.5.0-1/CHANGELOG.md for details on this\
  \ release."
