summary: |
  Updated samba packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Samba is a suite of programs used by machines to share files, printers, and
  other information.

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the password change page of
  the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT). If a remote attacker could trick
  a user, who was logged into the SWAT interface, into visiting a
  specially-crafted URL, it would lead to arbitrary web script execution in
  the context of the user's SWAT session. (CVE-2011-2694)

  It was found that SWAT web pages did not protect against Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker could trick a user,
  who was logged into the SWAT interface, into visiting a specially-crafted
  URL, the attacker could perform Samba configuration changes with the
  privileges of the logged in user. (CVE-2011-2522)

  A race condition flaw was found in the way the mount.cifs tool mounted CIFS
  (Common Internet File System) shares. If mount.cifs had the setuid bit set,
  a local attacker could conduct a symbolic link attack to trick mount.cifs
  into mounting a share over an arbitrary directory they were otherwise not
  allowed to mount to, possibly allowing them to escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2010-0787)

  It was found that the mount.cifs tool did not properly handle share or
  directory names containing a newline character. If mount.cifs had the
  setuid bit set, a local attacker could corrupt the mtab (mounted file
  systems table) file via a specially-crafted CIFS share mount request.
  (CVE-2010-0547)

  It was found that the mount.cifs tool did not handle certain errors
  correctly when updating the mtab file. If mount.cifs had the setuid bit
  set, a local attacker could corrupt the mtab file by setting a small file
  size limit before running mount.cifs. (CVE-2011-1678)

  Note: mount.cifs from the samba packages distributed by Red Hat does not
  have the setuid bit set. We recommend that administrators do not manually
  set the setuid bit for mount.cifs.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2011-2694
  and CVE-2011-2522; the Debian Security Team for reporting CVE-2010-0787;
  and Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-1678. Upstream acknowledges
  Nobuhiro Tsuji of NTT DATA Security Corporation as the original reporter of
  CVE-2011-2694; Yoshihiro Ishikawa of LAC Co., Ltd. as the original reporter
  of CVE-2011-2522; and the Debian Security Team acknowledges Ronald Volgers
  as the original reporter of CVE-2010-0787.

  Users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
