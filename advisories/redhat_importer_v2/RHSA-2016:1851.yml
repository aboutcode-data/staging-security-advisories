  - CVE-2016-5387
summary: |
  Updated packages are available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 that provide Red Hat JBoss Core Services Service Pack 1 fixing one security issue.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that Apache HTTP Server used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5387)

  Note: After this update, Apache HTTP Server will no longer pass the value of the Proxy request header to scripts via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

  Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.
