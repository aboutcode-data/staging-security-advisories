  - CVE-2014-3561
summary: |
  An updated rhevm-log-collector package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The rhevm-log-collector utility allows users to easily collect log files
  from all systems in their Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.

  It was found that rhevm-log-collector called sosreport with the PostgreSQL
  database password passed as a command line parameter. A local attacker
  could read this password by monitoring a process listing. The password
  would also be written to a log file, which could potentially be read by a
  local attacker. (CVE-2014-3561)

  This issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.

  All rhevm-log-collector users are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
