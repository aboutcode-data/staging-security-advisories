  - CVE-2010-4352
summary: |
  Updated dbus packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  D-Bus is a system for sending messages between applications. It is used for
  the system-wide message bus service and as a per-user-login-session
  messaging facility.

  A denial of service flaw was discovered in the system for sending messages
  between applications. A local user could send a message with an excessive
  number of nested variants to the system-wide message bus, causing the
  message bus (and, consequently, any process using libdbus to receive
  messages) to abort. (CVE-2010-4352)

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take effect, all
  running instances of dbus-daemon and all running applications using the
  libdbus library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.
