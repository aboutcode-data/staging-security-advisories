summary: |
  Updated Kerberos (krb5) packages that correct double-free and ASN.1
  parsing bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  Kerberos is a networked authentication system that uses a trusted third
  party (a KDC) to authenticate clients and servers to each other.

  Several double-free bugs were found in the Kerberos 5 KDC and libraries.  A
  remote attacker could potentially exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary
  code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the names CAN-2004-0642 and CAN-2004-0643 to these issues.

  A double-free bug was also found in the krb524 server (CAN-2004-0772),
  however this issue was fixed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users by a
  previous erratum, RHSA-2003:052.

  An infinite loop bug was found in the Kerberos 5 ASN.1 decoder library.  A
  remote attacker may be able to trigger this flaw and cause a denial of
  service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
  has assigned the name CAN-2004-0644 to this issue.

  All users of krb5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported security patches to resolve these issues.
