  - CVE-2014-6414
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
  system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
  function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
  as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

  It was discovered that unprivileged users could in some cases reset
  admin-only network attributes to their default values. This could lead to
  unexpected behavior or in some cases result in a denial of service.
  (CVE-2014-6414)

  These updated packages also fix various bugs. Documentation for these bug
  fixes is available in the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
