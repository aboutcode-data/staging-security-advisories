summary: "An updated redhat-ds package containing a number of fixes is now available\nas Red\
  \ Hat Directory Server 7.1 Service Pack 2.\n\nThis update has been rated as having a moderate\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nRed Hat Directory Server is an\
  \ LDAPv3 compliant server.\n\nFor the latest information, refer to the release notes at the\n\
  following URL:\n\n    http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server\n\nEvgeny Legerov discovered\
  \ several flaws affecting Red Hat Directory Server\nusing the GLEG ProtoVer LDAP test suite.\
  \  A remote attacker who is able to\nconnect to the directory server could send malicious\
  \ requests which would\ncause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-0451,\n\
  CVE-2006-0452, CVE-2006-0453)\n\nThis update also addresses the following issues:\n\n* 173687\
  \ - When the Directory Server's effective user and the real user \n  are different, there\
  \ was a small window that creates log files owned by\n  the real user, which should be owned\
  \ by the effective user.\n\n* 175063 - When an ldif file contains an entry with the dn that\
  \ includes\n  escaped double quotes, importing the entry could fail and the\n  entry is skipped.\
  \ The following reindex fails due to the skip.\n\n* 175897 - There was a problem in evaluating\
  \ the intersection of multiple\n  range searches when the attribute of each range search is\
  \ different from\n  each other. \n\n  For example: \n\n    &(attr1 <= val1)(attr2 >= val2)\
  \  \n\n  This issue has been fixed.\n\n* 185477 - In previous 7.X versions of Red Hat Directory\
  \ Server, importing\n  a malformed parent entry and some child entries resulted in the child\n\
  \  entries being successfully added without a parent.\n\n* 184585 - The server did not allow\
  \ a re-bind using SASL on the same\n  connection, returning error 49.\n\n* 185765 - The password\
  \ sync tool leaked memory.\n\n* 181827 - Deleting an attribute value by trimming it's value\
  \ to an empty\n  string in Active Directory did not sync to Red Hat Directory Server. This\n\
  \  issue has been fixed. \n\n* 186657 - Sustained heavy password modification load on the\
  \ Active\n  Directory side could potentially crash passsync.exe. This issue has been\n  fixed.\n\
  \nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these\nissues."
