summary: "Updated PHP packages are available for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and\npSeries systems.\n\
  \nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP server. \n\
  \nThe mail function in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 may allow local script authors to\nbypass safe mode\
  \ restrictions and modify command line arguments to an\nMTA (such as Sendmail).  Specifically,\
  \ the fifth argument to mail() may be\nmodified, altering MTA behavior and possibly allowing\
  \ the execution of\narbitrary local commands.\n\nThe mail function in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 does\
  \ not filter ASCII control\ncharacters from its arguments, which could allow remote attackers\
  \ to\nmodify mail message content, including mail headers, and possibly use\nPHP as a \"spam\
  \ proxy.\"\n\nScript authors should note that all input should be checked for unsafe data\n\
  by any PHP scripts calling functions such as mail().\n\nPHP versions 4.0.5 through 4.1.0 in\
  \ safe mode do not properly cleanse\nthe 5th parameter to the mail() function. This vulnerability\
  \ allows local\nusers and possibly remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell\n\
  metacharacters.\n\nNote that this PHP errata enforces memory limits on the size of the PHP\n\
  process to prevent a badly generated script from becoming a possible source\nfor a denial\
  \ of service attack. The default process size is 8MB, though you\ncan adjust this as necessary\
  \ through the php.ini directive memory_limit.\nFor example, to change the process memory limit\
  \ to 4MB, add\nthe following:\n\nmemory_limit 4194304\n\nImportant Note:\n\nYour original\
  \ /etc/php.ini configuration file is not replaced or\noverwritten. Therefore, you should carefully\
  \ review your configuration file\nand adapt it as necessary to your server or service functions."
