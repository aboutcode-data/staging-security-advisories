summary: |
  An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A race condition flaw was found in the N_HLDC Linux kernel driver when accessing n_hdlc.tbuf list that can lead to double free. A local, unprivileged user able to set the HDLC line discipline on the tty device could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-2636, Important)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation freed SKB (socket buffer) resources for a DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet when the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option is set on the socket. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to alter the kernel memory, allowing them to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-6074, Important)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel key management subsystem in which a local attacker could crash the kernel or corrupt the stack and additional memory (denial of service) by supplying a specially crafted RSA key. This flaw panics the machine during the verification of the RSA key. (CVE-2016-8650, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of setsockopt for the SO_{SND|RCV}BUFFORCE setsockopt() system call. Users with non-namespace CAP_NET_ADMIN are able to trigger this call and create a situation in which the sockets sendbuff data size could be negative. This could adversely affect memory allocations and create situations where the system could crash or cause memory corruption. (CVE-2016-9793, Moderate)

  * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of clearing SELinux attributes on /proc/pid/attr files. An empty (null) write to this file can crash the system by causing the system to attempt to access unmapped kernel memory. (CVE-2017-2618, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alexander Popov for reporting CVE-2017-2636; Andrey Konovalov (Google) for reporting CVE-2017-6074; and Ralf Spenneberg for reporting CVE-2016-8650. The CVE-2017-2618 issue was discovered by Paul Moore (Red Hat Engineering).

  Bug Fix(es):

  * The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-514.rt56.219, which provides a number of bug fix updates over the previous version. (BZ#1429613)
