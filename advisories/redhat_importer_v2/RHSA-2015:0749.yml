  - CVE-2014-0191
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation
  of various XML standards.

  It was discovered that libxml2 loaded external parameter entities even when
  entity substitution was disabled. A remote attacker able to provide a
  specially crafted XML file to an application linked against libxml2 could
  use this flaw to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, possibly
  resulting in a denial of service or an information leak on the system.
  (CVE-2014-0191)

  The CVE-2014-0191 issue was discovered by Daniel P. Berrange of Red Hat.

  All libxml2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The desktop must be
  restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
