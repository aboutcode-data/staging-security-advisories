  - CVE-2013-0156
summary: |
  Updated rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activesupport,
  ruby193-rubygem-actionpack, and ruby193-rubygem-activesupport packages that
  fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat OpenShift
  Enterprise 1.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
  components. Active Support provides support and utility classes used by the
  Ruby on Rails framework.

  Multiple flaws were found in the way Ruby on Rails performed XML parameter
  parsing in HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails application,
  perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication using a
  specially-created HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0156)

  Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for the CVE-2013-0156 issues is
  available that allows remote code execution in applications using Ruby on
  Rails.

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct these issues. For Red Hat OpenShift
  Enterprise administrators, the openshift-broker and openshift-console
  services must be restarted for this update to take effect. Users of
  OpenShift are advised to update their own applications that are running
  Ruby on Rails.
