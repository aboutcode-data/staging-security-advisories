  - CVE-2015-5189
  - CVE-2015-5190
summary: |
  Updated pcs packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The pcs packages provide a command-line configuration system for the
  Pacemaker and Corosync utilities.

  A command injection flaw was found in the pcsd web UI. An attacker able to
  trick a victim that was logged in to the pcsd web UI into visiting a
  specially crafted URL could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with
  root privileges on the server hosting the web UI. (CVE-2015-5190)

  A race condition was found in the way the pcsd web UI backend performed
  authorization of user requests. An attacker could use this flaw to send a
  request that would be evaluated as originating from a different user,
  potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with permissions of a
  more privileged user. (CVE-2015-5189)

  These issues were discovered by Tomáš Jelínek of Red Hat.

  All pcs users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
