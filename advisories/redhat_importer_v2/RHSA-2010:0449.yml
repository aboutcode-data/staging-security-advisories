  - CVE-2010-1439
summary: |
  Updated rhn-client-tools packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Network Client Tools provide programs and libraries that allow your
  system to receive software updates from the Red Hat Network (RHN).

  It was discovered that rhn-client-tools set insecure permissions on the
  loginAuth.pkl file, used to store session credentials for authenticating
  connections to Red Hat Network servers. A local, unprivileged user could
  use these credentials to download packages from the Red Hat Network. They
  could also manipulate package or action lists associated with the system's
  profile. (CVE-2010-1439)

  Users of rhn-client-tools are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
