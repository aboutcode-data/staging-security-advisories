aliases:
  - CVE-2014-9684
  - CVE-2015-1881
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix two security issues and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Image Service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
  images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
  and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  Multiple flaws were found in the glance task API that could cause untracked
  image data to be left in the back end. A malicious user could use these
  flaws to deliberately accumulate untracked image data, and cause a denial
  of service via resource exhaustion. (CVE-2014-9684, CVE-2015-1881)

  The openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.2.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1210457)

  All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
