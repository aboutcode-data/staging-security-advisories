  - CVE-2016-3698
summary: |
  An update for libndp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Libndp is a library (used by NetworkManager) that provides a wrapper for the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol. It also provides a tool named ndptool for sending and receiving NDP messages.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that libndp did not properly validate and check the origin of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages. An attacker on a non-local network could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, allowing them to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on a connecting client, or disrupt the network connectivity of that client. (CVE-2016-3698)

  Red Hat would like to thank Julien Bernard (Viagénie) for reporting this issue.
