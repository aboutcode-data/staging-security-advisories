  - CVE-2001-0731
summary: |
  Updated Apache packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1,
  and 7.2.  These packages upgrade the Apache Web server to version 1.3.22,
  which closes a potential security bug which would present clients with a
  listing of the contents of a directory instead of the contents of an index
  file, or in case of an error, the error message.

  By using a carefully constructed HTTP request, a server with
  mod_negotiation and either mod_dir or mod_autoindex loaded could be tricked
  into displaying a listing of the contents of a directory, despite the
  presence of an index file.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the names CAN-2001-0730, and CAN-2001-0731 to these
  issues.
