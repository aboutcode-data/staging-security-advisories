summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2, which fixes multiple security
  issues and several bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that
  provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss
  Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.

  This JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 release serves as a replacement for
  JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to
  the JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 Release Notes for information on the
  most significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available
  shortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that the implementation of the
  org.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method
  provided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.
  A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)

  It was found that Mojarra JavaServer Faces did not properly escape
  user-supplied content in certain circumstances. Contents of outputText tags
  and raw EL expressions that immediately follow script or style elements
  were not escaped. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL to
  execute arbitrary web script in the user's browser. (CVE-2013-5855)

  It was found that the security audit functionality, provided by JBoss
  Operations Network, logged request parameters in plain text. This may have
  caused passwords to be included in the audit log files when using BASIC or
  FORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access to audit log files
  could possibly use this flaw to obtain application or server authentication
  credentials. Refer to the Solution section of this advisory for additional
  information on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2014-0058)

  A flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could
  allow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a
  series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on
  the server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0193)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting
  CVE-2014-3530, and James Roper of Typesafe for reporting CVE-2014-0193.

  All users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2.
