  - CVE-2011-1769
  - CVE-2011-1781
summary: |
  Updated systemtap packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SystemTap is an instrumentation system for systems running the Linux
  kernel, version 2.6. Developers can write scripts to collect data on the
  operation of the system.

  Two divide-by-zero flaws were found in the way SystemTap handled malformed
  debugging information in DWARF format. When SystemTap unprivileged mode was
  enabled, an unprivileged user in the stapusr group could use these flaws to
  crash the system. Additionally, a privileged user (root, or a member of the
  stapdev group) could trigger these flaws when tricked into instrumenting a
  specially-crafted ELF binary, even when unprivileged mode was not enabled.
  (CVE-2011-1769, CVE-2011-1781)

  SystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues.
