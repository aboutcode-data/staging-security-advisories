summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.0, which
  fixes three security issues, several bugs, and adds various enhancements,
  is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  It was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML Java
  implementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity
  (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)

  It was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project
  allowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying
  Transforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a
  denial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)

  In Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, when running under a
  security manager, it was possible for deployed code to get access to the
  Modular Service Container (MSC) service registry without any permission
  checks. This could allow malicious deployments to modify the internal state
  of the server in various ways. (CVE-2014-0018)

  The CVE-2013-6440 was discovered by David Illsley, Ron Gutierrez of Gotham
  Digital Science, and David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and
  the CVE-2014-0018 issue was discovered by Stuart Douglas of Red Hat.

  This release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.2.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Documentation for
  these changes will be available shortly from the JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform 6.2.1 Release Notes, linked to in the References.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
