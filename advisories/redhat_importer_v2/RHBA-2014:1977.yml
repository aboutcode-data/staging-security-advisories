summary: |
  An updated docker package that fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

  Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application
  as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually
  anywhere.

  The docker packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.3.2, which provides
  a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version, the most
  notable of which is the "exec" command which allows for processes to be spawned
  inside a Docker container. (BZ#1167870)

  Users of docker are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes
  these bugs and adds these enhancements. After installing the update, docker
  containers must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
