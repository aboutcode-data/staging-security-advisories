summary: "An update is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying\nand monitoring\
  \ a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud\nbased on Red Hat OpenStack\
  \ Platform.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A resource-permission flaw was found in the python-tripleo\
  \ and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates packages where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created\
  \ as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on\
  \ Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus\
  \ potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume. \n\nTo exploit\
  \ this flaw, the attacker must have local access to an overcloud node. However by default,\
  \ access to overcloud nodes is restricted and accessible only from the management undercloud\
  \ server on an internal network. (CVE-2017-12155)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Katuya Kawakami\
  \ (NEC).\n\n* It was discovered that the memcached connections using UDP transport protocol\
  \ can be abused for efficient traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\
  \ A remote attacker could send a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of\
  \ a target system to memcached, causing it to send a significantly larger response to the\
  \ target. (CVE-2018-1000115)\n\nThis update also includes the following bug fixes and enhancements:\n\
  \n* Prior to this update, when removing the ceph-osd RPM from overcloud nodes that do not\
  \ require the package, the corresponding Ceph OSD product key was not removed. Consequently,\
  \ the subscription-manager would incorrectly report that the Ceph OSD product was still installed.\n\
  With this update, the script that handles removal of the ceph-osd RPM now also removes the\
  \ Ceph OSD product key. Note: The script that removes the RPM and product key executes only\
  \ during the overcloud update procedure; the product key is removed only when the overcloud\
  \ node is updated.\nAs a result, after removing the ceph-osd RPM, the subscription-manager\
  \ no longer reports the Ceph OSD product is installed. (BZ#1571436)\n\n* Previously, there\
  \ were errors in the director Heat template that configures the VMAX Cinder backend driver.\
  \ Consequently, the VMAX driver would not function correctly. With this update, the errors\
  \ have been corrected, and the VMAX driver functions correctly. (BZ#1546799)\n\n* This enhancement\
  \ adds director support for deploying the Dell EMC VMAX cinder backend. (BZ#1546793)\n\n*\
  \ In this enhancement, if a minor update is blocked by an existing yum process that prevents\
  \ the package update, the process should exit with an appropriate error message. This was\
  \ added because the minor update may appear to freeze, due to yum waiting for the existing\
  \ yum.pid to exit; when it eventually fails it is not immediately clear why. As a result,\
  \ if there is an existing yum process preventing the package update, then the minor update\
  \ fails with a clear message to indicate this: \"ERROR existing yum.pid detected - can't continue!\
  \ Please ensure there is no other package update process for the duration of the minor update\
  \ worfklow. Exiting\". (BZ#1471721)"
