  - CVE-2021-44716
summary: "An update for sg-core-container is now available for Service Telemetry Framework 1.3.\n\
  \nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important.\
  \ A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity\
  \ rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\
  \nService Telemetry Framework (STF) provides automated collection of measurements and data\
  \ from remote clients, such as Red Hat OpenStack Platform or third-party nodes. STF then transmits\
  \ the information to a centralized, receiving Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) deployment\
  \ for storage, retrieval, and monitoring.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* golang: net/http: limit\
  \ growth of header canonicalization cache (CVE-2021-44716) \n\nFor more details about the\
  \ security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer\
  \ to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* In some cases, Ceilometer\
  \ metrics were not handled properly by sg-core. This resulted in some Ceilometer metrics not\
  \ being stored in Prometheus. In this release, the processing of metrics has been enhanced\
  \ to be more robust. While the sg-core has been enhanced to support larger messages from Ceilometer,\
  \ an additional change is required to support passing the larger messages through the sg-bridge\
  \ ring buffer. The changes required to fully support this functionality are being tracked\
  \ in RHBZ#2053683. (BZ#2016460)"
