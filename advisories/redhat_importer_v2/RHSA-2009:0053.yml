summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and several bugs\nare now\
  \ available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe kernel packages contain the\
  \ Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThese updated packages address\
  \ the following security issues:\n\n* a flaw was found in the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)\
  \ subsystem. A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use the flaw to listen on the same socket\n\
  more than once, possibly causing a denial of service. (CVE-2008-5079,\nImportant)\n\n* a buffer\
  \ overflow flaw was found in the libertas driver. This could,\npotentially, lead to a remote\
  \ denial of service when an invalid beacon or\nprobe response was received. (CVE-2008-5134,\
  \ Important)\n\n* a race condition was found in the Linux kernel \"inotify\" watch removal\n\
  and umount implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user  \nto cause a privilege\
  \ escalation or a denial of service. (CVE-2008-5182,  \nImportant)\n\n* the sendmsg() function\
  \ in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX\nsocket garbage collection. This could, potentially,\
  \ lead to a local denial\nof service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)\n\n* a buffer overflow was\
  \ found in the Linux kernel Partial Reliable Stream\nControl Transmission Protocol (PR-SCTP)\
  \ implementation. This could,\npotentially, lead to a denial of service if a Forward-TSN chunk\
  \ is received\nwith a large stream ID. (CVE-2009-0065, Important)\n\n* a deficiency was found\
  \ in the libATA implementation. This could,\npotentially, lead to a denial of service. By\
  \ default, the \"/dev/sg*\"\ndevices are accessible only to the root user. (CVE-2008-5700,\
  \ Low)\n\nThese updated packages also address numerous bugs, including the following:\n\n\
  * a race condition caused the timer to stop responding. This was fixed by\ncorrecting the\
  \ behavior of the alloc_posix_timer() function. \n\n* the kernel was behaving differently\
  \ for varying file capabilities. This\nwas resolved by ensuring the get_file_caps() function\
  \ was preceded by\nclearing bprm->caps_*.\n\n* a check was included on the limit of the shadow.bytes\
  \ array, to prevent\nvalue outside the limits being written and over riding other data areas.\n\
  \n* the kernel-rt-2.6.24.7-81.el5rt kernel displayed a warning on boot\nstating that the hwclock\
  \ failed. This was due to a compatibility problem\nwith the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 file\
  \ system. It was resolved by adding\na new udev rule that ensured /dev was set up correctly.\n\
  \n* the GPS clock daemon was becoming unstable due to a problem in adjtimex.\nThe issue was\
  \ located and corrected.\n\n* the events_trace tracer was providing bad parameters to syscalls\
  \ on i386\nmachines. This was due to the sys_call interface needing to use the\nassembly linked\
  \ annotation and the edx register being used before it was\nstored on the stack. Both these\
  \ issues were corrected.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG users should install this update which\
  \ addresses\nthese vulnerabilities and fixes these bugs. For this update to take effect,\n\
  the system must be rebooted."
