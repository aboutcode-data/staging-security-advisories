  - CVE-2012-0698
summary: |
  Updated trousers packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  TrouSerS is an implementation of the Trusted Computing Group's Software
  Stack (TSS) specification. You can use TrouSerS to write applications that
  make use of your TPM hardware. TPM hardware can create, store and use RSA
  keys securely (without ever being exposed in memory), verify a platform's
  software state using cryptographic hashes and more.

  A flaw was found in the way tcsd, the daemon that manages Trusted Computing
  resources, processed incoming TCP packets. A remote attacker could send a
  specially crafted TCP packet that, when processed by tcsd, could cause the
  daemon to crash. Note that by default tcsd accepts requests on localhost
  only. (CVE-2012-0698)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Lutomirski for reporting this issue.

  The trousers package has been upgraded to upstream version 0.3.13, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,
  including corrected internal symbol names to avoid collisions with other
  applications, fixed memory leaks, added IPv6 support, fixed buffer handling
  in tcsd, as well as changed the license to BSD. (BZ#633584, BZ#1074634)

  All trousers users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements.
