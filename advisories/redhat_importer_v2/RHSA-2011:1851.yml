  - CVE-2011-4862
summary: "Updated krb5 packages that fix one security issue are now available for\nRed Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 4 and 5.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical\n\
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed\
  \ severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.\n\nKerberos\
  \ is a network authentication system which allows clients and servers\nto authenticate to\
  \ each other using symmetric encryption and a trusted third-\nparty, the Key Distribution\
  \ Center (KDC).\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the MIT krb5 telnet daemon (telnetd).\
  \ A\nremote attacker who can access the telnet port of a target machine could use\nthis flaw\
  \ to execute arbitrary code as root. (CVE-2011-4862)\n\nNote that the krb5 telnet daemon is\
  \ not enabled by default in any version of \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux. In addition, the default\
  \ firewall rules block\nremote access to the telnet port. This flaw does not affect the telnet\n\
  daemon distributed in the telnet-server package.\n\nFor users who have installed the krb5-workstation\
  \ package, have enabled the\ntelnet daemon, and have it accessible remotely, this update should\
  \ be\napplied immediately. \n\nAll krb5-workstation users should upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages, which\ncontain a backported patch to correct this issue."
