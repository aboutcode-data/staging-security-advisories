  - CVE-2014-4040
summary: "Updated powerpc-utils packages that fix one security issue, several bugs,\nand add\
  \ various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having Low security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\
  \ CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\nThe powerpc-utils packages provide various utilities\
  \ for the PowerPC platform.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the snap utility of powerpc-utils\
  \ generated an archive containing a configuration snapshot of a service. A local attacker\
  \ could obtain sensitive information from the generated archive such as plain text passwords.\
  \ (CVE-2014-4040)\n\nThe powerpc-utils packages have been upgraded to the upstream version\
  \ 1.2.24, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.\
  \ (BZ#1088539, BZ#1167865, BZ#1161552)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n*\
  \ Previously, the lsdevinfo command did not correctly process the path to the device, which\
  \ made the path unreadable in the console output of lsdevinfo. With this update, lsdevinfo\
  \ has been updated and the path is now displayed correctly. (BZ#1079246)\n\n* Previously,\
  \ after migrating several Linux partitions, Resource Monitoring and Control (RMC) was inactive\
  \ and Machine Type, Model, and Serial number (MTMS) were set incorrectly, so the subsequent\
  \ validation operation failed. This bug has been fixed, and validation is now successful after\
  \ migration and suspend. (BZ#1083221)\n\n* Previously, when the drmgr tool attempted to remove\
  \ the last CPU from the system, drmgr became unresponsive or terminated unexpectedly. This\
  \ bug has been fixed, and drmgr no longer hangs or crashes in the described case. (BZ#1152313)\n\
  \n* With this update, the drmgr utility has been fixed to correctly gather Logical Memory\
  \ Block (LMB) information while performing Mem Dynamic Logical Partitioning (DLPAR) on little-endian\
  \ varian of IBM Power Systems CPU architecture as expected (BZ#1170856).\n\n* Previously,\
  \ the \"ppc64_cpu --threads-per-core\" command returned incorrect data with the --smt option\
  \ enabled. This bug has been fixed and \"ppc64_cpu --threads-per-core\" now reports correctly\
  \ with enabled --smt. (BZ#1179263)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\
  \n* This update adds support for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux for POWER, little endian CPU\
  \ architecture to the powerpc-utils package. (BZ#1124006)\n\n* This update adds support for\
  \ hot plugging of the qemu virtio device with the drmgr command to the powerpc-utils package.(BZ#1083791)\n\
  \n* The deprecated snap tool has been removed from the powerpc-utils packages. Its functionality\
  \ has been integrated into the sosreport tool. (BZ#1172087)\n\n* With this update, a dependency\
  \ on the perl-Data-Dumper package required by the rtas_dump utility has been added to powerpc-utils\
  \ packages. (BZ#1175812) \n\nUsers of powerpc-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements."
