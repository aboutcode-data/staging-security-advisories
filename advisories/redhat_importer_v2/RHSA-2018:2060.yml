  - CVE-2018-3639
summary: "An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security\
  \ impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives\
  \ a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in\
  \ the References section.\n\nKVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution\
  \ for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space\
  \ component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor\
  \ designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly\
  \ used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction\
  \ sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which\
  \ a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update\
  \ into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never\
  \ actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read\
  \ privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)\n\n\
  Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn\
  \ (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.\n\nNote: This is the qemu-kvm-rhev side\
  \ of the CVE-2018-3639 mitigation that includes support for guests running on hosts with AMD\
  \ processors.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, using device passthrough for a SCSI-2 device\
  \ failed and returned an \"Illegal Request\" error. With this update, the QEMU emulator checks\
  \ the SCSI version of the device when performing passthrough. As a result, the described problem\
  \ no longer occurs. (BZ#1571370)\n \n* Under certain circumstances, resuming a paused guest\
  \ generated redundant \"VIR_DOMAIN_PAUSED_UNKNOWN\" error messages in the libvirt log. This\
  \ update corrects the event sending order when resuming guests, which prevents the errors\
  \ being logged. (BZ#1582122)\n\nEnhancement(s):\n\n* With this update, Ceph storage is supported\
  \ by KVM virtualization on all CPU architectures supported by Red Hat. (BZ#1588001)"
