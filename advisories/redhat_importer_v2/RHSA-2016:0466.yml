aliases:
  - CVE-2015-5600
  - CVE-2016-3115
summary: |
  Updated openssh packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure Shell) protocol implementation.
  These packages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client
  and server.

  It was discovered that the OpenSSH server did not sanitize data received
  in requests to enable X11 forwarding. An authenticated client with
  restricted SSH access could possibly use this flaw to bypass intended
  restrictions. (CVE-2016-3115)

  It was discovered that the OpenSSH sshd daemon did not check the list of
  keyboard-interactive authentication methods for duplicates. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to bypass the MaxAuthTries limit, making it
  easier to perform password guessing attacks. (CVE-2015-5600)

  All openssh users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.
