  - CVE-2009-2694
summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  Federico Muttis of Core Security Technologies discovered a flaw in Pidgin's
  MSN protocol handler. If a user received a malicious MSN message, it was
  possible to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
  Pidgin. (CVE-2009-2694)

  Note: Users can change their privacy settings to only allow messages from
  users on their buddy list to limit the impact of this flaw.

  These packages upgrade Pidgin to version 2.5.9. Refer to the Pidgin release
  notes for a full list of changes: http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  this issue. Pidgin must be restarted for this update to take effect.
