  - CVE-2006-0645
summary: "Updated gnutls packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red\nHat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red\n\
  Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThe GNU TLS Library provides support for cryptographic algorithms\
  \ and\nprotocols such as TLS. GNU TLS includes Libtasn1, a library developed for\nASN.1 structures\
  \ management that includes DER encoding and decoding.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way\
  \ libtasn1 decodes DER.  An attacker\ncould create a carefully crafted invalid X.509 certificate\
  \ in such a way\nthat could trigger this flaw if parsed by an application that uses GNU TLS.\n\
  This could lead to a denial of service (application crash).  It is not\ncertain if this issue\
  \ could be escalated to allow arbitrary code execution. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project assigned the name\nCVE-2006-0645 to this issue.\n\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4,\
  \ the GNU TLS library is only used by the\nEvolution client when connecting to an Exchange\
  \ server or when publishing\ncalendar information to a WebDAV server.\n\nUsers are advised\
  \ to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch from the GNU TLS\
  \ maintainers to correct this issue."
