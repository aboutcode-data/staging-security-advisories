  - CVE-2017-11499
summary: |
  An update for rh-nodejs4, rh-nodejs4-node-gyp, and rh-nodejs4-nodejs is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rh-nodejs4-nodejs (4.8.4). (BZ#1476314)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that Node.js was using a non-randomized seed when populating hash tables. An attacker, able to supply a large number of inputs, could send specially crafted entries to the Node.js application, maximizing hash collisions to trigger an excessive amount of CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2017-11499)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * The /opt/rh/rh-nodejs4/root/usr/share/licenses/ directory was not owned by any package. Consequently, when the rh-nodejs4 collection was uninstalled, the directory was not removed. This bug has been fixed, and the aforementioned directory is correctly removed after uninstalling rh-nodejs4. (BZ#1316626)
