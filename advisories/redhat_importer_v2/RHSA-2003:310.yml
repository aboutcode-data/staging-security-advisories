summary: "Updated fileutils packages that close a potential denial of service\nvulnerability\
  \ are now available.\n\nThe fileutils package contains several basic system utilities. One\
  \ of\nthese utilities is the \"ls\" program, which is used to list information\nabout files\
  \ and directories. \n\nGeorgi Guninski discovered a memory starvation denial of service\n\
  vulnerability in the ls program.  It is possible to make ls allocate a\nhuge amount of memory\
  \ by specifying certain command line arguments.  This\nvulnerability is remotely exploitable\
  \ through services like wu-ftpd, which\npass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0854 to this issue.\n\
  \nA non-exploitable integer overflow in ls has been discovered.  It is\npossible to make ls\
  \ crash by specifying certain command line arguments. \nThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable\
  \ through services like wu-ftpd,\nwhich pass user arguments to ls.  The Common Vulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0853 to this issue.\n\
  \nUsers are advised to update to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security\
  \ patches that correct these vulnerabilities.\n\nThese packages also add support for the O_DIRECT\
  \ flag, which controls the\nuse of synchronous I/O on file systems such as OCFS."
