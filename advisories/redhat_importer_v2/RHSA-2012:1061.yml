  - CVE-2012-3375
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fix:

  * The fix for CVE-2011-1083 (RHSA-2012:0150) introduced a flaw in the way
  the Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll) subsystem handled resource clean up
  when an ELOOP error code was returned. A local, unprivileged user could use
  this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-3375, Moderate)

  Bug fixes:

  * The qla2xxx driver handled interrupts for QLogic Fibre Channel adapters
  incorrectly due to a bug in a test condition for MSI-X support. This update
  corrects the bug and qla2xxx now handles interrupts as expected.
  (BZ#816373)

  * A process scheduler did not handle RPC priority wait queues correctly.
  Consequently, the process scheduler failed to wake up all scheduled tasks
  as expected after RPC timeout, which caused the system to become
  unresponsive and could significantly decrease system performance. This
  update modifies the process scheduler to handle RPC priority wait queues as
  expected. All scheduled tasks are now properly woken up after RPC timeout
  and the system behaves as expected. (BZ#817571)

  * The kernel version 2.6.18-308.4.1.el5 contained several bugs which led to
  an overrun of the NFS server page array. Consequently, any attempt to
  connect an NFS client running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.8 to the NFS
  server running on the system with this kernel caused the NFS server to
  terminate unexpectedly and the kernel to panic. This update corrects the
  bugs causing NFS page array overruns and the kernel no longer crashes in
  this scenario. (BZ#820358)

  * An insufficiently designed calculation in the CPU accelerator in the
  previous kernel caused an arithmetic overflow in the sched_clock() function
  when system uptime exceeded 208.5 days. This overflow led to a kernel panic
  on the systems using the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) or Virtual Machine
  Interface (VMI) clock source. This update corrects the calculation so that
  this arithmetic overflow and kernel panic can no longer occur under these
  circumstances.

  Note: This advisory does not include a fix for this bug for the 32-bit
  architecture. (BZ#824654)

  * Under memory pressure, memory pages that are still a part of a
  checkpointing transaction can be invalidated. However, when the pages were
  invalidated, the journal head was re-filed onto the transactions' "forget"
  list, which caused the current running transaction's block to be modified.
  As a result, block accounting was not properly performed on that modified
  block because it appeared to have already been modified due to the journal
  head being re-filed. This could trigger an assertion failure in the
  "journal_commit_transaction()" function on the system. The "b_modified"
  flag is now cleared before the journal head is filed onto any transaction;
  assertion failures no longer occur. (BZ#827205)

  * When running more than 30 instances of the cclengine utility concurrently
  on IBM System z with IBM Communications Controller for Linux, the system
  could become unresponsive. This was caused by a missing wake_up() function
  call in the qeth_release_buffer() function in the QETH network device
  driver. This update adds the missing wake_up() function call and the system
  now responds as expected in this scenario. (BZ#829059)

  * Recent changes removing support for the Flow Director from the ixgbe
  driver introduced bugs that caused the RSS (Receive Side Scaling)
  functionality to stop working correctly on Intel 82599EB 10 Gigabit
  Ethernet network devices. This update corrects the return code in the
  ixgbe_cache_ring_fdir function and setting of the registers that control
  the RSS redirection table. Also, obsolete code related to Flow Director
  support has been removed. The RSS functionality now works as expected on
  these devices. (BZ#832169)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
