summary: |
  Updated libpng packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which
  give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
  manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

  It was discovered that the png_get_PLTE() and png_set_PLTE() functions of
  libpng did not correctly calculate the maximum palette sizes for bit depths
  of less than 8. In case an application tried to use these functions in
  combination with properly calculated palette sizes, this could lead to a
  buffer overflow or out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could exploit this to
  cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking an
  unsuspecting user into processing a specially crafted PNG image. However,
  the exact impact is dependent on the application using the library.
  (CVE-2015-8126, CVE-2015-8472)

  An array-indexing error was discovered in the png_convert_to_rfc1123()
  function of libpng. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause an
  out-of-bounds read by tricking an unsuspecting user into processing a
  specially crafted PNG image. (CVE-2015-7981)

  All libpng users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
