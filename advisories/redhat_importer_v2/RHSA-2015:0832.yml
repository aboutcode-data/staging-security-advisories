  - CVE-2015-1842
summary: |
  Updated openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules packages that fix
  one security issue and adds one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  PackStack is a command-line utility for deploying OpenStack on existing
  servers over an SSH connection. Deployment options are provided either
  interactively, using the command line, or non-interactively by means of a
  text file containing a set of preconfigured values for OpenStack
  parameters. PackStack is suitable for deploying proof-of-concept
  installations.

  It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
  openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
  known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
  was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands
  as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

  This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * If OpenStack Networking (neutron) is enabled, Packstack now displays a
  warning if the Network Manager service is active on hosts. (BZ#1117115)

  All openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules users are advised to
  upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add
  this enhancement.
