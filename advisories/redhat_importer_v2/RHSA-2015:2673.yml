  - CVE-2015-7713
summary: "Updated OpenStack Compute packages that resolve various issues are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 for\nRHEL 7.\n\nOpenStack Compute (nova)\
  \ launches and schedules large networks of virtual\nmachines, creating a redundant and scalable\
  \ cloud computing platform.\nCompute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required\
  \ to\norchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and\ncontrolling access\
  \ through users and projects.\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the way OpenStack Compute\
  \ (nova)\nnetworking handled security group updates; changes were not applied to\nalready\
  \ running VM instances. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\naccess running VM instances.\
  \ (CVE-2015-7713)\n\nAdditional updates include:\n\n* The openstack-nova packages have been\
  \ upgraded to upstream version \n2015.1.2. See https://launchpad.net/nova/kilo/2015.1.2 for\
  \ a complete list\nof bug fixes and enhancements. (BZ#1274875)\n\n* When using huge pages,\
  \ the back-end memory for a guest was configured as\nprivate. This disallowed an external\
  \ process connected to a vhostuser VIF\ntype to access the QEMU guest's memory, which is required\
  \ by the QEMU\nnetwork driver functionality. The memory mappings are now marked as\nshared,\
  \ and the external process to provide QEMU network is able to access\nthe guest's memory.\
  \ (BZ#1215790)\n\n* The termination of a WSGI application or an RPC server immediately\nstopped\
  \ the service and interrupted requests that were in progress. This\nupdate adds a graceful\
  \ handler for the SIGTERM signal sent to the parent\nWSGI process, so the termination is performed\
  \ gracefully, which allows\nongoing processes to continue. (BZ#1250269)\n\n* Previously, novaclient\
  \ records requested time even when timing was set \nto False. As a consequence, system memory\
  \ kept increasing. With this\nupdate, when timing is set to True, the time of each request\
  \ is recorded \nand the timings are reset to clear the memory, which no longer\nincreases.\
  \ (BZ#1260868)\n\n* An earlier update changed the return value when no host devices were\n\
  found when connecting to an iSCSI or iSER volume. Consequently, when no\nhost devices were\
  \ found, an exception was thrown and the connect volume\nattempt failed. This update adds\
  \ an additional check to ensure\nos.path.exists(None) is never called. As a result, an exception\
  \ is no\nlonger thrown and the connect logic correctly retries finding present\nhost devices.\
  \ (BZ#1268051)\n\n* Compute's rootwrap filters restricted an `ln` command used by the volume\n\
  encryption providers to a specific iSCSI related target path. Consequently,\niSER, NFS, and\
  \ FC volumes encountered failures because the `ln` command was\nrejected by Compute's rootwrap\
  \ filters. This update makes Nova's rootwrap\nfilters more generic when calling `ln` allowing\
  \ the volume encryption\nproviders to succeed. (BZ#1273466)\n\n* FCoE devices have different\
  \ sysfs paths to standard FC devices.\nConsequently, Nova failed when attempting to attach\
  \ an FCoE based volume\nto an instance as it assumed these paths were the same. This update\
  \ ensures\nthat the required PCI information is parsed from both FC and FCoE sysfs\ndevice\
  \ paths. As a result, Nova now succeeds in attaching FCoE based\nvolumes to instances. (BZ#1274054)\n\
  \n* Nova failed to parse the output from the `multipath -l ${device}` command\nwhen errors\
  \ were present. Consequently, the attaching and detaching of\nvolumes could fail. This update\
  \ corrects the find_multipath_device method\nto ensure that any errors present in the output\
  \ from the aforementioned\ncommand are ignored. As a result, both the attaching and detaching\
  \ of\nvolumes will now succeed even if errors occur. (BZ#1275937)\n\n* Volumes were not correctly\
  \ detached if an error was encountered during\nthe attach process, and could be left attached\
  \ to an instance, resulting\nin data loss. This update ensures that the volume is both detached\n\
  and the connection to the volume closed in the event of a failure during\nthe attach process.\
  \ (BZ#1276011)\n\n* The ability of the libvirt driver to set the admin password has been \n\
  added. To use this feature, run the following command:  \n    nova root-password [server]\n\
  (BZ#1261100)"
