summary: |
  This is the End Of Life notification for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy, the
  regular 7 year life-cycle of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 has ended.

  Red Hat has discontinued the regular subscription services for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3. Therefore, new bug fix, enhancement, and security
  errata updates, as well as technical support services are no longer
  available for the following products:

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 3
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS 3
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extras 3
  * Red Hat Desktop 3
  * Red Hat Global File System 3
  * Red Hat Cluster Suite 3

  Servers subscribed to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 channels on the Red Hat
  Network will shortly become unsubscribed. As a benefit of the Red Hat
  subscription model, those subscriptions can be used to entitle any system
  on any currently supported release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscriptions are version-independent and allow
  access to all major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, that are
  currently supported within their regular 7-year life-cycle. Therefore
  customers retain access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and soon to be
  released 6. There are no additional upgrade fees when moving from Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 3 to any of these newer releases.

  For customers who are unable to migrate off Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, Red
  Hat is offering a limited, optional extension program referred to as RHEL 3
  Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS). For more information, contact your Red
  Hat sales representative or channel partner on this program. Additionally
  you can find more information on this program here:
  http://www.redhat.com/rhel/server/extended_lifecycle_support/

  Once you are eligible for subscribing to the RHEL 3 ELS channels, read the
  Red Hat Knowledgebase article DOC-40489 at
  https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-40489 for detailed information on how
  to subscribe to the RHEL 3 ELS channels.

  Details of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life-cycle can be found on the Red
  Hat website: http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/errata/
