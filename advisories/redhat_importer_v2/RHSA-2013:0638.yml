summary: |
  Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.2, which fixes several security issues, is
  now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
  solution from Red Hat, and is designed for on-premise or private cloud
  deployments.

  A flaw was found in the handling of paths provided to ruby193-rubygem-rack.
  A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct a directory traversal
  attack by passing malformed requests. (CVE-2013-0262)

  A timing attack flaw was found in the way rubygem-rack and
  ruby193-rubygem-rack processed HMAC digests in cookies. This flaw could aid
  an attacker using forged digital signatures to bypass authentication
  checks. (CVE-2013-0263)

  It was found that Jenkins did not protect against Cross-Site Request
  Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was
  logged into Jenkins, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker
  could perform operations on Jenkins. (CVE-2013-0327, CVE-2013-0329)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Jenkins. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to conduct an XSS attack against users of Jenkins.
  (CVE-2013-0328)

  A flaw could allow a Jenkins user to build jobs they do not have access to.
  (CVE-2013-0330)

  A flaw could allow a Jenkins user to cause a denial of service if they
  are able to supply a specially-crafted payload. (CVE-2013-0331)

  Users are advised to upgrade to Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.2. It is
  recommended that you restart your system after applying this update.
