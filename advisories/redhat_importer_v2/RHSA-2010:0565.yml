  - CVE-2010-2074
summary: |
  Updated w3m packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The w3m program is a pager (or text file viewer) that can also be used as a
  text mode web browser.

  It was discovered that w3m is affected by the previously published "null
  prefix attack", caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
  certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted certificate
  signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker could use the
  certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse w3m
  into accepting it by mistake. (CVE-2010-2074)

  All w3m users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
