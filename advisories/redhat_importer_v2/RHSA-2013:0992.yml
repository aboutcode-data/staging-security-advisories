summary: |
  Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix two security issues, one
  bug, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0
  (Grizzly) Preview.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Python-keystoneclient is the client library and command line utility for
  interacting with the OpenStack identity API.

  A flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient handled encrypted data
  from memcached. Even when the memcache_security_strategy setting in
  "/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" was set to ENCRYPT to help prevent
  tampering, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged
  user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to
  bypass intended restrictions and modify data in memcached that will later
  be used by services utilizing python-keystoneclient (such as Nova, Cinder,
  Swift, Glance, and so on). (CVE-2013-2166)

  A flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient verified data from
  memcached. Even when the memcache_security_strategy setting in
  "/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf" was set to MAC to perform signature
  checking, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged
  user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to
  modify data in memcached that will later pass signature checking in
  python-keystoneclient. (CVE-2013-2167)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original
  reporter.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * python-webob1.2 (which can be installed in parallel with python-webob1.0)
  was not found by python-keystoneclient. Attempting to import python-webob
  from python-keystoneclient failed with a stack trace. This could also be
  observed with other applications using python-keystoneclient, such as
  OpenStack Swift. With this update, python-keystoneclient can import
  python-webob1.2 independently from other installed versions. (BZ#971026)

  Additionally, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * This update adds support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Signature Version
  4 to python-keystoneclient. This makes python-keystoneclient compatible
  with future versions of python-boto, which will use Signature Version 4 by
  default. (BZ#970134)

  All users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview are advised to install
  these updated packages, which correct these issues and add this
  enhancement.
