summary: |
  An update for python is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  * python: Missing salt initialization in _elementtree.c module (CVE-2018-14647)

  * python: NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate (CVE-2019-5010)

  * python: CRLF injection via the query part of the url passed to urlopen() (CVE-2019-9740)

  * python: CRLF injection via the path part of the url passed to urlopen() (CVE-2019-9947)

  * python: Undocumented local_file protocol allows remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms (CVE-2019-9948)
