summary: |
  Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 Service Pack 4: an updated redhat-ds package
  that fixes a security issue and several bugs is now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server.

  It was discovered that Red Hat Directory Server 7.1, when running on Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux, used insecure permissions on certain directories.
  Local users could replace Java(TM) Archive (JAR) files and run arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Red Hat Directory Server, or
  its applications. (CVE-2008-0890)

  As well, this updated package fixes the followings bugs:

  * when LDAP operations such as "ldapsearch" were issued while the server
  was creating a browsing index for the suffix, Red Hat Directory Server
  hanged.

  * when a bind operation returned LDAP controls, such as in pass-through
  authentication, Red Hat Directory Server crashed.

  * if multiple-simultaneous LDAP operations were issued on entries, which
  were indexed in a VLV index, Red Hat Directory Server hanged.

  * minor memory leaks, including memory leaks in replication, SASL, and
  indexing, have been resolved.

  * the Red Hat Directory Server crashed during start up if a log rotation
  file, such as "access.rotationinfo", had a size value of 0 bytes.

  * on 64-bit platforms, LDAP search operations would intermittently time
  out, causing them to fail.

  * it was not possible to send data larger than 512 bytes through SASL
  GSSAPI. Connections failed with a message decoding error.

  * when the password lockout option was set, previous log in failures were
  not cleared from the passwordCount attribute, even after a successful log
  in.

  * when an entry had a NULL attribute value for an attribute in a VLV index,
  editing the entry caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.

  * repeatedly removing and adding the same replica and replication
  agreement, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.

  * random operation failures occurred when multiple-simultaneous SASL
  operations were initiated.

  * while VLV indexes were being created, Red Hat Directory Server ignored
  stop operations. Stop operations sent during index creation hanged.

  * adding an invalid DN syntax caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash,
  instead of rejecting the entry.

  * modify operations that included an invalid attribute value, caused Red
  Hat Directory server to crash.

  * malformed member URLs for dynamic groups, such as ones missing the
  terminal parentheses, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.

  * in the previous redhat-ds package, SASL mappings were hard coded. In
  this updated package, SASL mappings use regular expressions, that are
  dynamically generated on start up. A "*" character can no longer be used
  for the SASL mapping search filter.

  * repeatedly creating and deleting databases with VLV indexes, caused Red
  Hat Directory Server to crash.

  * editing an entry with an attribute with non-ASCII values, and indexed
  with a substring index, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.

  * in the previous redhat-ds package, SASL operations did not properly
  switch the SASL I/O function set to the original I/O function set.

  * during online replication initialization, if the data included any entry
  larger than 80% of the entry cache size, Red Hat Directory Server crashed.

  * online-replication initialization hanged endlessly when the import data
  included two consecutive entries, which totaled more than 80% of the entry
  cache size.
