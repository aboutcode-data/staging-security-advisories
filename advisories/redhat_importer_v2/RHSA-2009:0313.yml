summary: |
  Updated wireshark packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was
  previously known as Ethereal.

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark read
  a malformed packet off a network or opened a malformed dump file, it could
  crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark.
  (CVE-2008-4683, CVE-2009-0599)

  Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
  crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
  opened a malformed dump file. (CVE-2008-4680, CVE-2008-4681, CVE-2008-4682,
  CVE-2008-4684, CVE-2008-4685, CVE-2008-5285, CVE-2009-0600)

  Users of wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Wireshark version 1.0.6, and resolve these issues. All running instances of
  Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.
