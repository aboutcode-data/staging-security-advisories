summary: |
  Updated libvirt packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 5th May 2011]
  After installing this update and restarting the libvirtd service, the
  "virsh attach-disk" command failed. Rebooting guest systems after
  installing the update resolved the issue. The erratum text has been updated
  to reflect that guest systems must be rebooted. Future updates will advise
  if a guest reboot is needed. No changes have been made to the packages.

  libvirt is a C API for managing and interacting with the virtualization
  capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. libvirt also provides
  tools for remotely managing virtualized systems.

  The libvirtd daemon was discovered to not properly check user connection
  permissions before performing certain privileged actions, such as
  requesting migration of an unprivileged guest domain to another system. A
  local user able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use
  this flaw to perform actions that should be restricted to read-write
  connections. (CVE-2008-5086)

  libvirt_proxy, a setuid helper application allowing non-privileged users to
  communicate with the hypervisor, was discovered to not properly validate
  user requests. Local users could use this flaw to cause a stack-based
  buffer overflow in libvirt_proxy, possibly allowing them to run arbitrary
  code with root privileges. (CVE-2009-0036)

  All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches which resolve these issues. After installing the update,
  libvirtd must be restarted manually (for example, by issuing a "service
  libvirtd restart" command), and guest systems rebooted, for this change to
  take effect.
