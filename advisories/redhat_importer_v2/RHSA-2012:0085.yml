aliases:
  - CVE-2011-3670
  - CVE-2012-0442
summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes two security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A flaw was found in the processing of malformed content. An HTML mail
  message containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-0442)

  The same-origin policy in Thunderbird treated http://example.com and
  http://[example.com] as interchangeable. A malicious script could possibly
  use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information (such as a client's
  IP and user e-mail address, or httpOnly cookies) that may be included in
  HTTP proxy error replies, generated in response to invalid URLs using
  square brackets. (CVE-2011-3670)

  Note: The CVE-2011-3670 issue cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
  HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
  It could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing
  the full remote content of an RSS feed.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  resolves these issues. All running instances of Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.
