  - CVE-2017-12173
summary: |
  An update for sssd and ding-libs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It also provides the Name Service Switch (NSS) and the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) interfaces toward the system, and a pluggable back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources.

  The ding-libs packages contain a set of libraries used by the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) as well as other projects, and provide functions to manipulate file system path names (libpath_utils), a hash table to manage storage and access time properties (libdhash), a data type to collect data in a hierarchical structure (libcollection), a dynamically growing, reference-counted array (libref_array), and a library to process configuration files in initialization format (INI) into a library collection data structure (libini_config).

  Security Fix(es):

  * sssd: unsanitized input when searching in local cache database (CVE-2017-12173)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  This issue was discovered by Sumit Bose (Red Hat).
