  - CVE-2014-8162
summary: |
  Updated spacewalk packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Satellite 5.7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat Satellite is a system management tool for Linux-based
  infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and remote
  management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.

  It was found that the RPC interface in Satellite would resolve external
  entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XML External Entity (XXE)
  attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to
  the user running the Satellite server, and potentially perform other more
  advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-8162)

  Red Hat would like to thank Travis Emmert for reporting this issue.

  All spacewalk users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
