  - CVE-2002-0659
summary: "A new Stronghold 3 release is available which contains an updated fix for\nthe OpenSSL\
  \ ASN1 vulnerability.\n\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, open source toolkit\
  \ which\nimplements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS\
  \ v1) protocols, as well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library. \n\nThe\
  \ OpenSSL group found an issue in the patch that was released to fix the\nprevious vulnerability\
  \ in the ASN.1 routines (RHSA-2002-164,\nCAN-2002-0659).  The previous patch did not completely\
  \ eliminate the\ninitial vulnerability and could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks\n\
  against a server.  It has not been verified if this issue could lead to\nfurther consequences,\
  \ such as remote code execution."
