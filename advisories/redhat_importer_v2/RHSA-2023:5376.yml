  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, during the reclaimspace operation, I/O and performance was impacted when the `rbd sparsify` command was executed on the RADOS block device (RBD) persistent volume claim (PVC) while it was attached to a pod. With this fix, the execution of the `rbd sparsify` command is skipped when the RBD PVC is found to be attached to a pod during the operation. As a result, any negative impact of running the reclaim space operation on a RBD PVC attached to a pod is mitigated. (BZ#2225436)

  * Previously, the container storage interface (CSI) CephFS and RADOS block device (RBD) pods were using older `cephcsi` image after the upgrade as the CSI CephFS and RBD holder pods were not getting updated. With this fix, the daemonset object for CSI CephFS and RBD holder are upgraded and steps to upgrade the corresponding pods are documented. As a result, after upgrading, the CSI holder pods use the latest `cephcsi` image. (BZ#2222600)

  All users of Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation are advised to upgrade to these updated images, which provide these bug fixes.
