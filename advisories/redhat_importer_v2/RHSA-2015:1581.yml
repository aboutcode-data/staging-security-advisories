  - CVE-2015-4495
summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  A flaw was discovered in Mozilla Firefox that could be used to violate the
  same-origin policy and inject web script into a non-privileged part of the
  built-in PDF file viewer (PDF.js). An attacker could create a malicious web
  page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal arbitrary files (including
  private SSH keys, the /etc/passwd file, and other potentially sensitive
  files) from the system running Firefox. (CVE-2015-4495)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Cody Crews as the original reporter.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 38.1.1 ESR, which corrects this issue. After installing the
  update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
