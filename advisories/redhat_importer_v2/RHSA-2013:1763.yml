  - CVE-2013-4164
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-ruby packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language.
  It has features to process text files and to perform system management
  tasks.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Ruby parsed floating point
  numbers from their text representation. If an application using Ruby
  accepted untrusted input strings and converted them to floating point
  numbers, an attacker able to provide such input could cause the application
  to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  application. (CVE-2013-4164)

  All ruby193-ruby users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
