  - CVE-2010-2811
summary: |
  Updated vdsm22 packages that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  VDSM is a management module that serves as a Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager agent on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.

  Note: This update has been tested and is supported on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.5 (with all appropriate post-GA 5.5-specific updates).

  A flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker
  could trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,
  preventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.
  (CVE-2010-2811)

  These updated vdsm22 packages also fix the following bugs:

  * suspend-to-file hibernation failed for huge guests due to the migration
  and hibernation constant values being too short for huge guests. This
  update makes the timeouts proportional to guest RAM size, thus allowing
  suspension of huge guests in all cases except where storage is unbearably
  slow. (BZ#601275)

  * under certain circumstances, restarting a VDSM that was being used as a
  Storage Pool Manager killed all system processes on the host. With this
  update, stopping VDSM is ensured to kill only the processes that it
  started, and the VDSM SIGTERM handler is not run concurrently. With these
  changes, all processes on the host are no longer killed when VDSM is
  restarted. (BZ#614849)

  * when VDSM was requested to "start in paused mode", it incorrectly
  reported virtual guest state as "WaitForLaunch" instead of "Paused", which
  led to the virtual guest being inaccessible from Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager. With this update, VDSM reports such virtual guests
  as "Paused", and users are able to connect to the virtual guest display.
  (BZ#616464)

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 2.2 users with Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux hosts should install these updated packages, which resolve these
  issues. Alternatively, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager can
  install the new package automatically.
