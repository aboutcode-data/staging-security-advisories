  - CVE-2012-3546
summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0.CP05 and 4.3.0.CP05 that
  fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT
  to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future
  (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business
  process execution speed and quality.

  It was found that when an application used FORM authentication, along with
  another component that calls request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to
  FormAuthenticator#authenticate() (such as the Single-Sign-On valve), it was
  possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator
  by appending "/j_security_check" to the end of a URL. A remote attacker
  with an authenticated session on an affected application could use this
  flaw to circumvent authorization controls, and thereby access resources not
  permitted by the roles associated with their authenticated session.
  (CVE-2012-3546)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  SOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,
  configuration files, and so on).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0.CP05 and 4.3.0.CP05 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
