summary: "Updated Kerberos packages for IBM iSeries and pSeries systems fix a number\nof vulnerabilities\
  \ found in MIT Kerberos.\n\nKerberos is a network authentication system. The MIT Kerberos\
  \ team\nreleased an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the\nkerberos\
  \ packages shipped by Red Hat. These vulnerabilities include:\n\nAn integer signedness error\
  \ in the ASN.1 decoder before version 1.2.5\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of\
  \ service (crash) via a large\nunsigned data element length, which is later used as a negative\
  \ value. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0036\
  \ to this issue. \n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) before version 1.2.5 allows remote,\n\
  authenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within\nthe same realm\
  \ using a certain protocol request that causes a null\ndereference (CAN-2003-0058). \n\nThe\
  \ Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers to\ncause a denial\
  \ of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that\
  \ causes an out-of-bounds read of an array\n(CAN-2003-0072).\n\nThe Key Distribution Center\
  \ (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers\nto cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs\
  \ within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that causes the KDC to corrupt its\
  \ heap\n(CAN-2003-0082).\n\nA vulnerability in Kerberos before version 1.2.3 allows users\
  \ from one\nrealm to impersonate users in other realms that have the same inter-realm\nkeys\
  \ (CAN-2003-0059). \n\nThe MIT advisory for these issues also mentions format string\nvulnerabilities\
  \ in the logging routines (CAN-2003-0060). Previous versions\nof the kerberos packages from\
  \ Red Hat already contain fixes for this issue.\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the\
  \ support for triple-DES keys in the\nimplementation of the Kerberos IV authentication protocol,\
  \ which is\nincluded in MIT Kerberos (CAN-2003-0139).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in\
  \ the Kerberos IV authentication protocol\nthat allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm\
  \ key, which is\nshared with another realm, to impersonate any principal in that realm to\n\
  any service in that realm. This vulnerability can only be closed by\ndisabling cross-realm\
  \ authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the\
  \ RPC library used by the kadmin\nservice in Kerberos 5. A faulty length check in the RPC\
  \ library exposes\nkadmind to an integer overflow, which can be used to crash kadmind\n(CAN-2003-0028).\n\
  \nThe Kerberos 5 network authentication system contains an RPC library which\nincludes an\
  \ XDR decoder derived from Sun's RPC implementation. The Sun\nimplementation was recently\
  \ demonstrated to be vulnerable to a heap\noverflow. It is believed that the attacker needs\
  \ to be able to\nauthenticate to the kadmin daemon for this attack to be successful\n(CVE-2002-0391).\n\
  \nA stack buffer overflow was found in the implementation of the Kerberos v4\ncompatibility\
  \ administration daemon (kadmind4), which is part of the the\nMIT krb5 distribution, but not\
  \ enabled or used by default in Red Hat Linux.\nThis vulnerability could be exploited to gain\
  \ unauthorized root access to a\nKDC host. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the\
  \ daemon to\nsuccessfully perform this attack (CAN-2002-1235).\n\nA problem has been found\
  \ in the Kerberos ftp client. When retrieving a\nfile with a filename beginning with a pipe\
  \ character, the ftp client will\npass the filename to the command shell in a system() call.\
  \ This could\nallow a malicious ftp server to write to files outside of the current\ndirectory\
  \ or execute commands as the user running the ftp client\n(CAN-2003-0041).\n\nAll users of\
  \ Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich disable cross-realm authentication\
  \ by default for Kerberos IV and\nwhich contain backported patches that correct these issues."
