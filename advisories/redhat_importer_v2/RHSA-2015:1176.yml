summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
  bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
  JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
  the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
  section, for a list of changes.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
  flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

  The following security fixes are addressed in this release:

  It was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate verification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication also used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)

  It was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2013-7398)

  It was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not
  verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains. A
  man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and obtain
  sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)

  It was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not
  verify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

  It was found that the JClouds scriptbuilder Statements class writes a temporary file to a predictable location. An attacker could use this flaw to access sensitive data, denial of service, or other attacks. (CVE-2014-4651)

  It was found that SSLSocket in Smack did not perform hostname verification. An attacker could redirect traffic between an application and an XMPP server by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control. (CVE-2014-5075)

  It was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)

  It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

  It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

  It was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)

  The CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.
