summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 and 6.5 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND followed DNS
  delegations. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted zone
  containing a large number of referrals which, when looked up and processed,
  would cause named to use excessive amounts of memory or crash.
  (CVE-2014-8500)

  A flaw was found in the way BIND handled requests for TKEY DNS resource
  records. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make named (functioning
  as an authoritative DNS server or a DNS resolver) exit unexpectedly with an
  assertion failure via a specially crafted DNS request packet.
  (CVE-2015-5477)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND parsed certain malformed
  DNSSEC keys. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially
  crafted DNS query (for example, a query requiring a response from a zone
  containing a deliberately malformed key) that would cause named functioning
  as a validating resolver to crash. (CVE-2015-5722)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way BIND processed certain
  records with malformed class attributes. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to send a query to request a cached record with a malformed class
  attribute that would cause named functioning as an authoritative or
  recursive server to crash. (CVE-2015-8000)

  Note: This issue affects authoritative servers as well as recursive
  servers, however authoritative servers are at limited risk if they perform
  authentication when making recursive queries to resolve addresses for
  servers listed in NS RRSETs.

  Red Hat would like to thank ISC for reporting the CVE-2015-5477,
  CVE-2015-5722, and CVE-2015-8000 issues. Upstream acknowledges Jonathan
  Foote as the original reporter of CVE-2015-5477, and Hanno Böck as the
  original reporter of CVE-2015-5722.

  All bind users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.
