  - CVE-2012-2141
summary: |
  Updated net-snmp packages that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  These packages provide various libraries and tools for the Simple Network
  Management Protocol (SNMP).

  An out-of-bounds buffer read flaw was found in the net-snmp agent. A remote
  attacker with read privileges to a Management Information Base (MIB)
  subtree handled by the "extend" directive (in "/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf") could
  use this flaw to crash snmpd via a crafted SNMP GET request.
  (CVE-2012-2141)

  Bug fixes:

  * Devices that used certain file systems were not reported in the
  "HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable" table. As a result, the snmpd daemon
  did not recognize devices using tmpfs, ReiserFS, and Oracle Cluster File
  System (OCFS2) file systems. This update recognizes these devices and
  reports them in the "HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable" table.
  (BZ#754652, BZ#755958, BZ#822061)

  * The snmptrapd (8) man page did not correctly describe how to load
  multiple configuration files using the "-c" option. This update describes
  correctly that multiple configuration files must be separated by a comma.
  (BZ#760001)

  * Integers truncated from 64 to 32-bit were not correctly evaluated. As a
  consequence, the snmpd daemon could enter an endless loop when encoding the
  truncated integers to network format. This update modifies the underlying
  code so that snmpd correctly checks truncated 64-bit integers. Now, snmpd
  avoids an endless loop. (BZ#783892)

  * snmpd did not correctly check for interrupted system calls when
  enumerating existing IPv6 network prefixes during startup. As a
  consequence, snmpd could prematurely exit when receiving a signal during
  this enumeration. This update checks the network prefix enumeration code
  for interrupted system calls. Now, snmpd no longer terminates when a signal
  is received. (BZ#799699)

  * snmpd used the wrong length of COUNTER64 values in the AgentX protocol.
  As a consequence, snmpd could not decode two consecutive COUNTER64 values
  in one AgentX packet. This update uses the correct COUNTER64 size and can
  process two or mode COUNTER64 values in AgentX communication. (BZ#803585)

  * snmpd ignored the "-e" parameter of the "trapsess" option in the snmpd
  configuration file. As a result, outgoing traps were incorrectly sent with
  the default EngineID of snmpd when configuring "trapsess" with an explicit
  EngineID. This update modifies the underlying code to send outgoing traps
  using the EngineID as specified in the "trapsess -e" parameter in the
  configuration file. (BZ#805689)

  * snmpd did not correctly encode negative Request-IDs in outgoing requests,
  for example during trap operations. As a consequence, a 32-bit value could
  be encoded in 5 bytes instead of 4, and the outgoing requests were refused
  by certain implementations of the SNMP protocol as invalid. With this
  update, a Request-ID can no longer become negative and is always encoded in
  4 bytes. (BZ#818259)

  * snmpd ignored the port number of the "clientaddr" option when specifying
  the source address of outgoing SNMP requests. As a consequence, the system
  assigned a random address. This update allows to specify both the port
  number and the source IP address in the "clientaddr" option. Now,
  administrators can increase security with firewall rules and
  Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) policies by configuring a specific source
  port of outgoing traps and other requests. (BZ#828691)

  * snmpd did not correctly process responses to internal queries when
  initializing monitoring enabled by the "monitor" option in the
  "/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf" configuration file. As a consequence, snmpd was not
  fully initialized and the error message "failed to run mteTrigger query"
  appeared in the system log 30 seconds after the snmpd startup. This update
  explicitly checks for responses to internal monitoring queries. (BZ#830042)

  Users of net-snmp should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the update,
  the snmpd and snmptrapd daemons will be restarted automatically.
