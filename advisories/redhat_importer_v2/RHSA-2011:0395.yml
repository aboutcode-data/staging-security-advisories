  - CVE-2011-0727
summary: |
  Updated gdm packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) provides the graphical login screen, shown
  shortly after boot up, log out, and when user-switching.

  A race condition flaw was found in the way GDM handled the cache
  directories used to store users' dmrc and face icon files. A local attacker
  could use this flaw to trick GDM into changing the ownership of an
  arbitrary file via a symbolic link attack, allowing them to escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2011-0727)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for
  reporting this issue.

  All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. GDM must be restarted for this
  update to take effect. Rebooting achieves this, but changing the runlevel
  from 5 to 3 and back to 5 also restarts GDM.
