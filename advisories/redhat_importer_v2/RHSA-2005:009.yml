summary: |
  Updated kdelib and kdebase packages that resolve several security issues
  are now available.

  The kdelibs packages include libraries for the K Desktop Environment. The
  kdebase packages include core applications for the K Desktop Environment.

  Secunia Research discovered a window injection spoofing vulnerability
  affecting the Konqueror web browser. This issue could allow a malicious
  website to show arbitrary content in a different browser window. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-1158
  to this issue.

  A bug was discovered in the way kioslave handles URL-encoded newline (%0a)
  characters before the FTP command. It is possible that a specially crafted
  URL could be used to execute any ftp command on a remote server, or
  potentially send unsolicited email. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-1165 to this issue.

  A bug was discovered that can crash KDE screensaver under certain local
  circumstances. This could allow an attacker with physical access to the
  workstation to take over a locked desktop session. Please note that this
  issue only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1. The Common Vulnerabilities
  and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-0078 to this issue.

  All users of KDE are advised to upgrade to this updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
