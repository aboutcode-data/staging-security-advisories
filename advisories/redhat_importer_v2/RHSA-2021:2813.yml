aliases:
  - CVE-2020-29573
summary: |
  An update for glibc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the name service cache daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

  Security Fix(es):

  * glibc: stack-based buffer overflow if the input to any of the printf family of functions is an 80-bit long double with a non-canonical bit pattern (CVE-2020-29573)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
