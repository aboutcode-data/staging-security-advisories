  \nCVS is a version control system frequently used to manage source code\nrepositories.  \n\
  \nSebastian Krahmer discovered a flaw in CVS clients where rcs diff files can\ncreate files\
  \ with absolute pathnames.  An attacker could create a fake\nmalicious CVS server that would\
  \ cause arbitrary files to be created or\noverwritten when a victim connects to it.  The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0180\
  \ to\nthis issue.\n\nDerek Price discovered a vulnerability whereby a CVS pserver could be\n\
  abused by a malicious client to view the contents of certain files outside\nof the CVS root\
  \ directory using relative pathnames containing \"../\".  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and\
  \ Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0405 to this issue.\n\n\
  Users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a patch correcting\
  \ this issue."
