summary: "An update for redhat-release-virtualization-host and redhat-virtualization-host is\
  \ now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for\
  \ each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nThe redhat-virtualization-host\
  \ packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host,\
  \ ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using\
  \ a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual\
  \ machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and\
  \ performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization\
  \ Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor.\
  \ Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit\
  \ user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A flaw was found in the implementation of the \"fill buffer\", a\
  \ mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU cache. If an attacker\
  \ can generate a load operation that would create a page fault, the execution will continue\
  \ speculatively with incorrect data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher\
  \ level caches. This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)\n\
  \n* Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level micro-optimizations to improve the\
  \ performance of writing data back to CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore\
  \ Address) and STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the processor to\
  \ hand-off address generation logic into these sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of\
  \ these sub-operations write to a shared distributed processor structure called the 'processor\
  \ store buffer'. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read private\
  \ data resident within the CPU's processor store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)\n\n* Microprocessors\
  \ use a ‘load port’ subcomponent to perform load operations from memory or IO. During a load\
  \ operation, the load port receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides\
  \ the data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU’s pipelines. Stale load operations\
  \ results are stored in the 'load port' table until overwritten by newer operations. Certain\
  \ load-port operations triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous\
  \ stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)\n\
  \n* Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may allow an\
  \ authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with\
  \ local access. (CVE-2019-11091)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including\
  \ the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\
  \ page(s) listed in the References section."
