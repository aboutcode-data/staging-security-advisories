  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  parameter entities were not disabled when the
  resteasy.document.expand.entity.references parameter was set to false.
  A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could
  use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
