summary: |
  An update for booth is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
  Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
  a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
  link(s) in the References section.

  The Booth cluster ticket manager is a component to bridge high availability clusters spanning multiple sites, in particular, to provide decision inputs to local Pacemaker cluster resource managers. It operates as a distributed consensus-based service, presumably on a separate physical network. Tickets facilitated by a Booth formation are the units of authorization that can be bound to certain resources. This will ensure that the resources are run at only one (granted) site at a time.

  Security Fix(es):

  * booth: specially crafted hash can lead to invalid HMAC being accepted by Booth server (CVE-2024-3049)
