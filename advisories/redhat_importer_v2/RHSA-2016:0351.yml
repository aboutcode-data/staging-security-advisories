summary: "Updated kubernetes packages that fix two security issues are now \navailable for Red\
  \ Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.2.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Moderate \nsecurity impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base \nscores, which\
  \ give detailed severity ratings, are available for each \nvulnerability from the CVE links\
  \ in the References section.\n\nOpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing\n\
  Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or \nprivate cloud deployments.\n\
  \nAn authorization flaw was discovered in Kubernetes; the API server did \nnot properly check\
  \ user permissions when handling certain requests. An\nauthenticated remote attacker could\
  \ use this flaw to gain additional \naccess to resources such as RAM and disk space. (CVE-2016-1905)\n\
  \nAn authorization flaw was discovered in Kubernetes; the API server did \nnot properly check\
  \ user permissions when handling certain build\nconfiguration strategies. A remote attacker\
  \ could create build \nconfigurations with strategies that violate policy. Although the attacker\
  \ could not launch the build themselves (launch fails when the \npolicy is violated), if the\
  \ build configuration files were later \nlaunched by other privileged services (such as automated\
  \ triggers), \nuser privileges could be bypassed allowing attacker escalation. \n(CVE-2016-1906)\n\
  \nAll OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 users are advised to upgrade to these \nupdated packages."
