  - CVE-2014-0164
summary: |
  An updated openshift-origin-broker-util package that fixes one security
  issue is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.2.7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The openshift-origin-broker-util package provides utility scripts for the
  OpenShift Broker service, which manages all user logins, DNS name
  resolution, application states, and general orchestration of the
  applications.

  It was discovered that the mcollective client.cfg configuration file was
  world-readable by default. A malicious, local user on a host with the
  OpenShift Broker installed could read sensitive information regarding the
  mcollective installation, including mcollective authentication credentials.
  A malicious user able to obtain said credentials would potentially have
  full control over all OpenShift nodes managed via mcollective.
  (CVE-2014-0164)

  This issue was discovered by Jeremy Choi of the Red Hat Quality
  Engineering Group.

  All openshift-origin-broker-util users are advised to upgrade to this
  updated package, which corrects this issue.
