summary: "Updated ntp packages that fix several security issues are now available for \nRed\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important\
  \ security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives\
  \ a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nThe Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time\nwith a referenced\
  \ time source.\n\nMultiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in ntpd's crypto_recv(),\n\
  ctl_putdata(), and configure() functions. A remote attacker could use\neither of these flaws\
  \ to send a specially crafted request packet that could\ncrash ntpd or, potentially, execute\
  \ arbitrary code with the privileges of\nthe ntp user. Note: the crypto_recv() flaw requires\
  \ non-default\nconfigurations to be active, while the ctl_putdata() flaw, by default, can\n\
  only be exploited via local attackers, and the configure() flaw requires\nadditional authentication\
  \ to exploit. (CVE-2014-9295)\n\nIt was found that ntpd automatically generated weak keys\
  \ for its internal\nuse if no ntpdc request authentication key was specified in the ntp.conf\n\
  configuration file. A remote attacker able to match the configured IP\nrestrictions could\
  \ guess the generated key, and possibly use it to send\nntpdc query or configuration requests.\
  \ (CVE-2014-9293)\n\nIt was found that ntp-keygen used a weak method for generating MD5 keys.\n\
  This could possibly allow an attacker to guess generated MD5 keys that\ncould then be used\
  \ to spoof an NTP client or server. Note: it is\nrecommended to regenerate any MD5 keys that\
  \ had explicitly been generated\nwith ntp-keygen; the default installation does not contain\
  \ such keys).\n(CVE-2014-9294)\n\nAll ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\
  \ which\ncontains backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the\nupdate,\
  \ the ntpd daemon will restart automatically."
