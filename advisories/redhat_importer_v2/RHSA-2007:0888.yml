summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix several security issues are now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 2.1\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by\
  \ the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an embedded-HTML scripting language that\
  \ is commonly used with the\nApache HTTP Server. \n\nVarious integer overflows were found\
  \ in the PHP gd extension. A script that\ncould be forced to resize images from an untrusted\
  \ source could possibly\nallow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the apache user.\
  \ \n(CVE-2007-3996)\n\nAn integer overflow was found in the PHP chunk_split function. If a\
  \ remote\nattacker was able to pass arbitrary data to the third argument of the\nchunk_split\
  \ function, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the\napache user.  Note that it\
  \ is unusual for a PHP script to use the\nchunk_script function with a user-supplied third\
  \ argument. (CVE-2007-2872)\n\nA previous security update introduced a bug into PHP session\
  \ cookie\nhandling.  This could allow an attacker to stop a victim from viewing a\nvulnerable\
  \ web site if the victim has first visited a malicious web page\nunder the control of the\
  \ attacker, and that page can set a cookie for the\nvulnerable web site. (CVE-2007-4670)\n\
  \nA bug was found in PHP session cookie handling.  This could allow an\nattacker to create\
  \ a cross-site cookie insertion attack if a victim follows\nan untrusted carefully-crafted\
  \ URL. (CVE-2007-3799)\n\nA flaw was found in the PHP 'ftp' extension. If a PHP script used\
  \ this\nextension to provide access to a private FTP server, and passed untrusted\nscript\
  \ input directly to any function provided by this extension, a remote\nattacker would be able\
  \ to send arbitrary FTP commands to the server.\n(CVE-2007-2509)\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues."
