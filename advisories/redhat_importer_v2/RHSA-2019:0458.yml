summary: |
  An update for vdsm is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The VDSM service is required by a Virtualization Manager to manage the Linux hosts. VDSM manages and monitors the host's storage, memory and networks as well as virtual machine creation, other host administration tasks, statistics gathering, and log collection.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: vdsm (4.20.47). (BZ#1677458)

  Security Fix(es):

  * vdsm: privilege escalation to root via systemd_run (CVE-2019-3831)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * VDSM attempted to collect OpenStack related information, even on hosts that are not connected to OpenStack, and displayed a repeated error message in the system log. In this release, errors originating from OpenStack related information are not recorded in the system log. As a result, the system log is quieter. (BZ#1673765)
