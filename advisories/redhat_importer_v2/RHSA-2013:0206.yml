summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 which fixes one
  security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,
  which integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and
  JBoss Seam.

  The GUI installer created a world-readable auto-install XML file containing
  both the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform administrator password and
  the sucker password for the selected messaging system in plain text. A
  local user able to access the directory where the GUI installer for JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 was run could use this flaw to gain
  administrative access to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  instance. (CVE-2013-0218)

  Note: This update provides the initial release of the GUI installer for
  version 5.2.0. Users continuing to use the 5.1.2 installer will remain
  vulnerable to this issue.

  This issue was discovered by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security
  Response Team.

  Users requiring the GUI installer for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  5.2.0 are advised to apply this update.
