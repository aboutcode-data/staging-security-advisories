summary: "Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs in the mozilla\npackage\
  \ are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having\
  \ critical security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSeaMonkey is an open\
  \ source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup\nclient, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.\n\
  \nThe Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Suite. This\nupdate deprecates\
  \ the Mozilla Suite in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 in favor\nof the supported SeaMonkey Suite.\n\
  \nThis update also resolves a number of outstanding Mozilla security issues:\n\nSeveral flaws\
  \ were found in the way Mozilla processed certain javascript\nactions. A malicious web page\
  \ could execute arbitrary javascript\ninstructions with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing\
  \ the page to steal\nsensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,\nCVE-2006-2784,\
  \ CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787)\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the way Mozilla\
  \ processed\ncertain web content. A malicious web page could crash firefox or possibly\nexecute\
  \ arbitrary code. These issues to date were not proven to be\nexploitable, but do show evidence\
  \ of memory corruption. (CVE-2006-2779,\nCVE-2006-2780)\n\nA double-free flaw was found in\
  \ the way Mozilla-mail displayed malformed\ninline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an\
  \ email message containing\na carefully crafted vcard it could execute arbitrary code as the\
  \ user\nrunning Mozilla-mail. (CVE-2006-2781) \n\nA cross site scripting flaw was found in\
  \ the way Mozilla processed Unicode\nByte-order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious\
  \ web page\ncould execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer could\nmiss\
  \ due to a malformed \"script\" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)\n\nA form file upload flaw was found\
  \ in the way Mozilla handled javascript\ninput object mutation. A malicious web page could\
  \ upload an arbitrary local\nfile at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)\n\
  \nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Mozilla called the\ncrypto.signText() javascript\
  \ function. A malicious web page could crash the\nbrowser if the victim had a client certificate\
  \ loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)\n\nTwo HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Mozilla\
  \ processed\ncertain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return\nspecially\
  \ crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy\nrestrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)\n\
  \nA double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was\ncalled. If a\
  \ victim visited a carefully crafted web page it could execute\narbitrary code as the user\
  \ running Mozilla. (CVE-2006-2788)\n\nUsers of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update,\
  \ which contains\nSeaMonkey version 1.0.2 that is not vulnerable to these issues."
