  - CVE-2014-0240
summary: |
  An updated mod_wsgi package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The mod_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI-compliant
  interface for hosting Python-based web applications within Apache.

  It was found that mod_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if the call to
  setuid() failed. If mod_wsgi was set up to allow unprivileged users to run
  WSGI applications, a local user able to run a WSGI application could
  possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
  (CVE-2014-0240)

  Note: mod_wsgi is not intended to provide privilege separation for WSGI
  applications. Systems relying on mod_wsgi to limit or sandbox the
  privileges of mod_wsgi applications should migrate to a different solution
  with proper privilege separation.

  Red Hat would like to thank Graham Dumpleton for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Róbert Kisteleki as the original reporter.

  All mod_wsgi users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
