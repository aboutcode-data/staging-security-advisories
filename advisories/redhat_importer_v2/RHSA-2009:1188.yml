summary: |
  An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
  is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Supplementary.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
  Player web browser plug-in.

  Multiple security flaws were found in the way Flash Player displayed
  certain SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a
  specially-crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or,
  possibly, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing
  the specially-crafted SWF content. (CVE-2009-1862, CVE-2009-1863,
  CVE-2009-1864, CVE-2009-1865, CVE-2009-1866, CVE-2009-1868, CVE-2009-1869)

  A clickjacking flaw was discovered in Flash Player. A specially-crafted
  SWF file could trick a user into unintentionally or mistakenly clicking a
  link or a dialog. (CVE-2009-1867)

  A flaw was found in the Flash Player local sandbox. A specially-crafted
  SWF file could cause information disclosure when it was saved to the hard
  drive. (CVE-2009-1870)

  All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
  upgrades Flash Player to version 10.0.32.18.
