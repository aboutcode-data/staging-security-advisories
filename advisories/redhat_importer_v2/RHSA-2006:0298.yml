summary: |
  Updated openssh packages that fix bugs in sshd are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure SHell) protocol implementation. This
  package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
  server.

  An arbitrary command execution flaw was discovered in the way scp copies
  files locally. It is possible for a local attacker to create a file with a
  carefully crafted name that could execute arbitrary commands as the user
  running scp to copy files locally. (CVE-2006-0225)

  The SSH daemon, when restricting host access by numeric IP addresses and
  with VerifyReverseMapping disabled, allows remote attackers to bypass
  "from=" and "user@host" address restrictions by connecting to a host from a
  system whose reverse DNS hostname contains the numeric IP address.
  (CVE-2003-0386)

  The following issues have also been fixed in this update:

  * If the sshd service was stopped using the sshd init script while the
    main sshd daemon was not running, the init script would kill other sshd
    processes, such as the running sessions.  For example, this could happen
    when the 'service sshd stop' command was issued twice.

  * When privilege separation was enabled, the last login message was printed
    only for the root user.

  * The sshd daemon was sending messages to the system log from a signal
    handler when debug logging was enabled. This could cause a deadlock of
    the user's connection.

  All users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues.
