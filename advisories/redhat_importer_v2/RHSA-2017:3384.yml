summary: |
  An update for liblouis is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Liblouis is an open source braille translator and back-translator named in honor of Louis Braille. It features support for computer and literary braille, supports contracted and uncontracted translation for many languages and has support for hyphenation. New languages can easily be added through tables that support a rule or dictionary based approach. Liblouis also supports math braille (Nemeth and Marburg).

  Security Fix(es):

  * A missing fix for one stack-based buffer overflow in findTable() for CVE-2014-8184 was discovered. An attacker could cause denial of service or potentially allow arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2017-15101)

  Red Hat would like to thank Samuel Thibault for reporting this issue.
