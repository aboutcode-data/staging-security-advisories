summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Directory Server and related packages that fix three
  security issues are now available for Red Hat Directory Server 8.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server. The
  redhat-ds-base package includes the LDAP server and command line utilities
  for server administration.

  A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Directory Server handled simple paged
  result searches. If an unauthenticated user were able to send multiple
  simple paged search requests to Directory Server, it could cause the server
  to crash. (CVE-2011-0019)

  When multiple Red Hat Directory Server instances were configured on the
  system to run under different unprivileged users, the Directory Server
  setup scripts set insecure permissions on the /var/run/dirsrv/ directory,
  which stores process ID (pid) files. A local user could use this flaw to
  manipulate the pid files in that directory, possibly preventing Directory
  Server instances from starting correctly, or causing the Directory Server
  init script to kill an arbitrary process when shutting down Directory
  Server. (CVE-2011-0022)

  It was found that multiple scripts shipped with Red Hat Directory Server
  set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to an insecure value
  containing an empty path. A local user able to trick a user running those
  scripts (usually the root user) to run them while working from an
  attacker-writable directory could use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges via a specially-crafted dynamic library. (CVE-2011-0532)

  All Red Hat Directory Server users should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the dirsrv daemon must be restarted ("service dirsrv restart")
  for the update to take effect.
