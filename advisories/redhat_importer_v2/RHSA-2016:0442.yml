  - CVE-2015-5295
summary: "Updated OpenStack Orchestration packages that fix one security issue are\nnow available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno)\nfor RHEL 7.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having Moderate security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available\
  \ for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nOpenStack Orchestration\
  \ (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify\nand deploy configurations for Compute,\
  \ Storage, and OpenStack Networking.\nIt can also be used to automate post-deployment actions,\
  \ which in turn\nallows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and\napplications.\
  \ Orchestration can also be integrated with Telemetry alarms to\nimplement auto-scaling for\
  \ certain infrastructure resources.\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the OpenStack Orchestration\
  \ \nservice (heat), where a specially formatted template could be used to\ntrick the heat-engine\
  \ service into opening a local file. Although the\nfile contents are never disclosed to the\
  \ end user, an OpenStack-\nauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of\
  \ service\nor determine whether a given file name is present on the server.\n(CVE-2015-5295)\n\
  \nThis issue was discovered by Steven Hardy of Red Hat."
