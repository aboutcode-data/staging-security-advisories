aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0188
summary: |
  Updated lv packages that fix the possibility of local privilege escalation
  are now available.

  Lv is a powerful file viewer similar to less. It can decode and encode
  multilingual streams through many coding systems, such as ISO-8859,
  ISO-2022, EUC, SJIS Big5, HZ, and Unicode.

  A bug has been found in versions of lv that read a .lv file in the current
  working directory.  Any user who subsequently runs lv in that directory
  and uses the v (edit) command can be forced to execute an arbitrary program.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a
  version of lv that is patched to read the .lv configuration file only in
  the user's home directory.
