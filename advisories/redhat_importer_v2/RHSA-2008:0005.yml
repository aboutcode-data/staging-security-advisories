summary: "Updated Apache httpd packages that fix several security issues are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web\
  \ server.\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_imap module. On sites where mod_imap was\nenabled\
  \ and an imagemap file was publicly available, a cross-site scripting\nattack was possible.\
  \ (CVE-2007-5000)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_autoindex module. On sites where directory\n\
  listings are used, and the \"AddDefaultCharset\" directive has been removed\nfrom the configuration,\
  \ a cross-site scripting attack was possible against\nWeb browsers which did not correctly\
  \ derive the response character set\nfollowing the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2007-4465)\n\n\
  A flaw was found in the mod_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is\nconfigured, a\
  \ remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that\nwould cause the Apache child\
  \ process handling that request to crash. On\nsites where a forward proxy is configured, an\
  \ attacker could cause a\nsimilar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious\
  \ site using\nthe proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded\nMulti-Processing\
  \ Module. (CVE-2007-3847) \n\nA flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status\
  \ was\nenabled and the status pages were publicly available, a cross-site\nscripting attack\
  \ was possible. (CVE-2007-6388)\n\nA flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp module. On sites\
  \ where mod_proxy_ftp\nwas enabled and a forward proxy was configured, a cross-site scripting\n\
  attack was possible against Web browsers which did not correctly derive the\nresponse character\
  \ set following the rules in RFC 2616. (CVE-2008-0005)\n\nUsers of Apache httpd should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to resolve these issues. Users\
  \ should restart\nhttpd after installing this update."
