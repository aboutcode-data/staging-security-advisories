  - CVE-2014-0132
summary: |
  Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages
  include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and
  command-line utilities for server administration.

  It was discovered that the 389 Directory Server did not properly handle
  certain SASL-based authentication mechanisms. A user able to authenticate
  to the directory using these SASL mechanisms could connect as any other
  directory user, including the administrative Directory Manager account.
  This could allow them to modify configuration values, as well as read and
  write any data the directory holds. (CVE-2014-0132)

  All 389-ds-base users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  this update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically.
