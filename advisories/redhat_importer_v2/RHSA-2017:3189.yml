summary: |
  An update for rh-eclipse47-jackson-databind is now available for Red Hat Developer Tools.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The jackson-databind package provides general data-binding functionality for Jackson, which works on top of Jackson core streaming API.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. This issue extends the previous flaw CVE-2017-7525 by blacklisting more classes that could be used maliciously. (CVE-2017-15095)

  Red Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting this issue.
