summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.2.1, which fixes three security issues
  and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.2.1 serves as a
  replacement for Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0. It includes various
  bug fixes, which are listed in the README file included with the patch
  files.

  The following security issues are fixed with this release:

  A flaw was discovered that when an application uses Groovy (has it on the
  classpath) and uses the standard Java serialization mechanism, an attacker
  can bake a special serialized object that executes code directly when
  deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not
  isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this
  vulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)

  It was found that Apache Camel's XML converter performed XML External
  Entity (XXE) expansion. A remote attacker able to submit an SAXSource
  containing an XXE declaration could use this flaw to read files accessible
  to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other
  more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0263)

  It was found that Apache Camel performed XML External Entity (XXE)
  expansion when evaluating invalid XML Strings or invalid XML GenericFile
  objects. A remote attacker able to submit a crafted XML message could use
  this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2015-0264)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.
