summary: |
  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1 is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
  managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
  administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts were added to
  the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. The Python scripts
  needed to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were
  stored in the "/tmp/" directory and could be pre-created by an attacker. A
  local, unprivileged user on the host to be added to the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization environment could use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges. This update provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Manager part of the fix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.
  (CVE-2012-0860)

  A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Hypervisor hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization environment. The Python scripts needed to configure the host
  for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way,
  that is, without properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS
  connections. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to
  conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining root access to the
  host being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This
  update provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager part of the
  fix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts) or
  RHSA-2012:1505 rhev-hypervisor6 update (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.
  (CVE-2012-0861)

  It was found that under certain conditions, Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager would fail to lock the screen on a virtual machine
  between SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments)
  sessions. A user with access to a virtual machine in Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Manager could potentially exploit this flaw to gain access
  to another user's unlocked desktop session. (CVE-2011-4316)

  It was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not
  correctly pass wipe-after-delete when moving disks between storage domains.
  This resulted in such disks not being securely deleted as expected,
  potentially leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2012-5516)

  A flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
  back end checked the privileges of users making requests via the SOAP and
  GWT APIs. An authenticated attacker able to issue queries against Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager could use this flaw to query data that
  they should not have access to. (CVE-2012-2696)

  These issues were discovered by Red Hat.

  In addition to resolving the above security issues these updated Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages fix various bugs, and add
  various enhancements.

  Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available in the
  Technical Notes:

  https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html

  All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
  to these updated packages which resolve these security issues, fix these
  bugs, and add these enhancements.
