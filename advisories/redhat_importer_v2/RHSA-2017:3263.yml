  - CVE-2017-1000257
summary: |
  An update for curl is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A buffer overrun flaw was found in the IMAP handler of libcurl. By tricking an unsuspecting user into connecting to a malicious IMAP server, an attacker could exploit this flaw to potentially cause information disclosure or crash the application. (CVE-2017-1000257)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Curl project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Brian Carpenter and the OSS-Fuzz project as the original reporters.
