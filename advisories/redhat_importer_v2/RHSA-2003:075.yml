summary: "Updated tomcat packages are now available for Stronghold 4.0 to\nclose a second JSP\
  \ source code exposure vulnerability.\n\nTomcat is the servlet container that is used in the\
  \ official Reference\nImplementation for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies.\
  \ \nA source code exposure vulnerability has been found that affects Tomcat\nversions 4.0.0\
  \ through 4.0.5 and 4.1.0 through 4.1.12, in a variant of\nthe issue addressed in RHSA-2002:218.\n\
  \nUsing a carefully crafted request, a remote attacker can read the source\ncode of any deployed\
  \ JSP file.   \n\nThe previous erratum for Stronghold on Advanced Server, RHSA-2002:218,\n\
  contained Tomcat 4.0.5 and is therefore susceptible to this vulnerability.\n\nAll users are\
  \ advised to upgrade to these erratum packages containing\nTomcat version 4.0.6 which is not\
  \ vulnerable to this issue."
