aliases:
  - CVE-2004-0488
  - CVE-2004-0492
summary: "Updated httpd and mod_ssl packages that fix minor security issues in\nthe Apache Web\
  \ server are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThe Apache HTTP Server is\
  \ a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nA buffer overflow\
  \ was found in the Apache proxy module, mod_proxy, which\ncan be triggered by receiving an\
  \ invalid Content-Length header.  In order\nto exploit this issue, an attacker would need\
  \ an Apache installation\nthat was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. \
  \ This would\ncause the Apache child processing the request to crash.  The Common\nVulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0492 to this issue.\n\
  \nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux platforms Red Hat believes this issue cannot\nlead to remote\
  \ code execution.  This issue also does not represent a Denial\nof Service attack as requests\
  \ will continue to be handled by other Apache\nchild processes.\n\nA stack buffer overflow\
  \ was discovered in mod_ssl which can be triggered if\nusing the FakeBasicAuth option.  If\
  \ mod_ssl is sent a client certificate\nwith a subject DN field longer than 6000 characters,\
  \ a stack overflow can\noccur if FakeBasicAuth has been enabled.  In order to exploit this\
  \ issue\nthe carefully crafted malicious certificate would have to be signed by a\nCertificate\
  \ Authority which mod_ssl is configured to trust.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0488 to this issue.\n\nThis update\
  \ also fixes a DNS handling bug in mod_proxy.\n\nThe mod_auth_digest module is now included\
  \ in the Apache package and should\nbe used instead of mod_digest for sites requiring Digest\
  \ authentication.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users of the Apache HTTP Server should upgrade\n\
  to these erratum packages, which contains Apache version 1.3.27 with \nbackported patches\
  \ correcting these issues."
