  - CVE-2011-1595
summary: |
  An updated rdesktop package that fixes one security issue is now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  rdesktop is a client for the Remote Desktop Server (previously, Terminal
  Server) in Microsoft Windows. It uses the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to
  remotely present a user's desktop.

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way rdesktop shared a local
  path with a remote server. If a user connects to a malicious server with
  rdesktop, the server could use this flaw to cause rdesktop to read and
  write to arbitrary, local files accessible to the user running rdesktop.
  (CVE-2011-1595)

  Red Hat would like to thank Cendio AB for reporting this issue. Cendio AB
  acknowledges an anonymous contributor working with the SecuriTeam Secure
  Disclosure program as the original reporter.

  Users of rdesktop should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
