  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform is a platform for Java applications,
  which integrates the JBoss Web Server with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

  org.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method
  provided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.
  A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)
