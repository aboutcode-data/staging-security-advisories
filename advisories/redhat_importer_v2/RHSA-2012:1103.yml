summary: |
  Updated pki-common, pki-tps and pki-util packages that fix multiple
  security issues and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
  Certificate System 8.1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to
  manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.

  Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in the Red Hat
  Certificate System Agent and End Entity pages. An attacker could use these
  flaws to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims using
  Certificate System's web interface. (CVE-2012-2662)

  It was discovered that Red Hat Certificate System's Certificate Manager
  did not properly check certificate revocation requests performed via its
  web interface. An agent permitted to perform revocations of end entity
  certificates could use this flaw to revoke the Certificate Authority (CA)
  certificate. (CVE-2012-3367)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * Red Hat Certificate System 8.1 did not previously allow using Red Hat
  Directory Server 9.0 as its internal database. This update adds support
  for Directory Server 9.0. (BZ#547527, BZ#819508)

  All users of Red Hat Certificate System 8.1 are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement.
  After installing this update, all Red Hat Certificate System subsystems
  must be restarted for the update to take effect.
