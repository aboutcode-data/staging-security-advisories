  - CVE-2010-4267
summary: |
  Updated hplip packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing (HPLIP) provides drivers for
  Hewlett-Packard printers and multifunction peripherals, and tools for
  installing, using, and configuring them.

  A flaw was found in the way certain HPLIP tools discovered devices using
  the SNMP protocol. If a user ran certain HPLIP tools that search for
  supported devices using SNMP, and a malicious user is able to send
  specially-crafted SNMP responses, it could cause those HPLIP tools to crash
  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running them. (CVE-2010-4267)

  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for
  reporting this issue.

  Users of hplip should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
