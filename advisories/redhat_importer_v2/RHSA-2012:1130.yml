  - CVE-2012-2625
summary: |
  Updated xen packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for
  managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux.

  A flaw was found in the way the pyGrub boot loader handled compressed
  kernel images. A privileged guest user in a para-virtualized guest (a DomU)
  could use this flaw to create a crafted kernel image that, when attempting
  to boot it, could result in an out-of-memory condition in the privileged
  domain (the Dom0). (CVE-2012-2625)

  Red Hat would like to thank Xinli Niu for reporting this issue.

  All users of xen are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
  updated packages, the xend service must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
