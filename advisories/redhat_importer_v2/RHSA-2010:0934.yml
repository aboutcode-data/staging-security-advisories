summary: |
  Updated acroread packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extras and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
  Supplementary.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  [Updated 7th December 2010]
  The package list in this erratum has been updated to make the packages
  available in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extras IA32 channels on the
  Red Hat Network.

  Adobe Reader allows users to view and print documents in Portable Document
  Format (PDF).

  This update fixes two vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader. These
  vulnerabilities are detailed on the Adobe security page APSB10-28, listed
  in the References section. A specially-crafted PDF file could cause Adobe
  Reader to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running
  Adobe Reader when opened. (CVE-2010-3654, CVE-2010-4091)

  All Adobe Reader users should install these updated packages. They contain
  Adobe Reader version 9.4.1, which is not vulnerable to these issues. All
  running instances of Adobe Reader must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
