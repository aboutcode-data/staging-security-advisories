summary: |
  Updated node.js packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is the company's cloud computing
  Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private
  cloud deployments.

  Node.js is a software development platform for building fast and scalable
  network applications in the JavaScript programming language.

  A flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when decrypting
  messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
  This flaw allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to decrypt a selected
  byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a
  victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL
  3.0 connections. (CVE-2014-3566)

  All OpenShift Enterprise users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue.
