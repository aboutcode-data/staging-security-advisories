summary: |
  Updated versions of Stronghold 3.0 are available to fix a number of
  vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, Apache, and PHP.

  Stronghold 3.0 contains a number of open source technologies such as
  OpenSSL, Apache, and PHP. The following paragraphs describe a number of
  issues that have been found in versions of these projects.

  In a paper, Brice Canvel, Alain Hiltgen, Serge Vaudenay, and Martin
  Vuagnoux describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC ciphersuites
  in SSL and TLS. An active attacker may be able to use timing observations
  to distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and
  MAC verification errors. Over multiple connections this can leak
  sufficient information to be able to retrieve the plain text of a common,
  fixed block. In order for an attack to be successful an attacker must be
  able to act as a man-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple
  connections which all involve a common fixed plain text block (such as a
  password), and have good network conditions that allow small changes in
  timing to be reliably observed.

  The SSL timing attack announced recently by David Brumly and Dan Boneh
  is not fixed by this erratum; this new issue will be addressed by a
  future erratum release.

  The Apache Web server does not prevent escape sequences from being written
  to log files. This could allow an attacker to embed arbitrary escape
  sequences into log files. A recent paper by HD Moore highlighted
  several issues where common terminal emulator software (such as xterm) can
  be remotely abused or exploited by displaying arbitrary escape sequences.

  The MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) used in the PHP MySQL extension
  in PHP versions earlier than 4.3.0 does not properly verify length fields
  for certain responses in the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which
  allows a malicious server to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
  arbitrary code.

  Stronghold 3.0 contains OpenSSL 0.9.6b, Apache 1.3.22, and PHP
  4.1.2 and is, therefore, vulnerable to these issues. Users of Stronghold are
  advised to update to the errata versions of Stronghold 3.0 which contain
  backported security fixes and are not vulnerable to these issues.
