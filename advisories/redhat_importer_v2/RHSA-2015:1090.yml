  - CVE-2015-4142
summary: |
  An updated wpa_supplicant package that fixes two security issues and adds
  one enhancement is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The wpa_supplicant package contains an 802.1X Supplicant with support for
  WEP, WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and various EAP authentication
  methods. It implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator for client
  stations and controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication and
  association of the WLAN driver.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way wpa_supplicant handled SSID
  information in the Wi-Fi Direct / P2P management frames. A specially
  crafted frame could allow an attacker within Wi-Fi radio range to cause
  wpa_supplicant to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2015-1863)

  An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer over-read, was found in the
  way wpa_supplicant handled WMM Action frames. A specially crafted frame
  could possibly allow an attacker within Wi-Fi radio range to cause
  wpa_supplicant to crash. (CVE-2015-4142)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jouni Malinen of the wpa_supplicant upstream
  for reporting the CVE-2015-1863 issue. Upstream acknowledges Alibaba
  security team as the original reporter.

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * Prior to this update, wpa_supplicant did not provide a way to require the
  host name to be listed in an X.509 certificate's Common Name or Subject
  Alternative Name, and only allowed host name suffix or subject substring
  checks. This update introduces a new configuration directive,
  'domain_match', which adds a full host name check. (BZ#1178263)

  All wpa_supplicant users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains backported patches to correct these issues and add this
  enhancement. After installing this update, the wpa_supplicant service will
  be restarted automatically.
