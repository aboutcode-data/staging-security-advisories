summary: |
  An update for the OpenSSL packages for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 6.3 that fixes multiple security issues is now available from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
  Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security
  (DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography
  library.

  It was discovered that the OBJ_obj2txt() function could fail to properly
  NUL-terminate its output. This could possibly cause an application using
  OpenSSL functions to format fields of X.509 certificates to disclose
  portions of its memory. (CVE-2014-3508)

  Two flaws were discovered in the way OpenSSL handled DTLS packets. A remote
  attacker could use these flaws to cause a DTLS server or client using
  OpenSSL to crash or use excessive amounts of memory. (CVE-2014-3505,
  CVE-2014-3506)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL performed a
  handshake when using the anonymous Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange. A
  malicious server could cause a DTLS client using OpenSSL to crash if that
  client had anonymous DH cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2014-3510)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
