summary: |
  Updated nss and nspr packages that fix multiple security issues, several
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
  the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
  applications.

  A flaw was found in the way TLS False Start was implemented in NSS.
  An attacker could use this flaw to potentially return unencrypted
  information from the server. (CVE-2013-1740)

  A race condition was found in the way NSS implemented session ticket
  handling as specified by RFC 5077. An attacker could use this flaw to crash
  an application using NSS or, in rare cases, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running that application. (CVE-2014-1490)

  It was found that NSS accepted weak Diffie-Hellman Key exchange (DHKE)
  parameters. This could possibly lead to weak encryption being used in
  communication between the client and the server. (CVE-2014-1491)

  An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in NSPR. A remote attacker could
  potentially use this flaw to crash an application using NSPR or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that
  application. This NSPR flaw was not exposed to web content in any shipped
  version of Firefox. (CVE-2014-1545)

  It was found that the implementation of Internationalizing Domain Names in
  Applications (IDNA) hostname matching in NSS did not follow the RFC 6125
  recommendations. This could lead to certain invalid certificates with
  international characters to be accepted as valid. (CVE-2014-1492)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting the
  CVE-2014-1490, CVE-2014-1491, and CVE-2014-1545 issues. Upstream
  acknowledges Brian Smith as the original reporter of CVE-2014-1490, Antoine
  Delignat-Lavaud and Karthikeyan Bhargavan as the original reporters of
  CVE-2014-1491, and Abhishek Arya as the original reporter of CVE-2014-1545.

  The nss and nspr packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.16.1 and
  4.10.6 respectively, which provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements
  over the previous versions. (BZ#1110857, BZ#1110860)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, when the output.log file was not present on the system, the
  shell in the Network Security Services (NSS) specification handled test
  failures incorrectly as false positive test results. Consequently, certain
  utilities, such as "grep", could not handle failures properly. This update
  improves error detection in the specification file, and "grep" and other
  utilities now handle missing files or crashes as intended. (BZ#1035281)

  * Prior to this update, a subordinate Certificate Authority (CA) of the
  ANSSI agency incorrectly issued an intermediate certificate installed on a
  network monitoring device. As a consequence, the monitoring device was
  enabled to act as an MITM (Man in the Middle) proxy performing traffic
  management of domain names or IP addresses that the certificate holder did
  not own or control. The trust in the intermediate certificate to issue the
  certificate for an MITM device has been revoked, and such a device can no
  longer be used for MITM attacks. (BZ#1042684)

  * Due to a regression, MD5 certificates were rejected by default because
  Network Security Services (NSS) did not trust MD5 certificates. With this
  update, MD5 certificates are supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
  (BZ#11015864)

  Users of nss and nspr are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
