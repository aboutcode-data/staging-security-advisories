aliases:
  - CVE-2016-4979
  - CVE-2016-5387
summary: |
  An update for httpd24-httpd is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that httpd used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5387)

  Note: After this update, httpd will no longer pass the value of the Proxy request header to scripts via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

  * A flaw was found in the way httpd performed client authentication using X.509 client certificates. When the HTTP/2 protocol was enabled, a remote attacker could use this flaw to access resources protected by certificate authentication without providing a valid client certificate. (CVE-2016-4979)

  Red Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting CVE-2016-5387 and Apache Software Foundation for reporting CVE-2016-4979. Upstream acknowledges Erki Aring (Liewenthal Electronics Ltd) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-4979.
