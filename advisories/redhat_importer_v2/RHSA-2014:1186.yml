  - CVE-2014-3120
summary: |
  An updated katello-configure package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The katello-configure package provides the katello-configure script, which
  configures the Katello installation, and the katello-upgrade script, which
  handles upgrades between versions.

  It was discovered that the default configuration of Elasticsearch enabled
  dynamic scripting, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary MVEL
  expressions and Java code via the source parameter passed to _search.
  (CVE-2014-3120)

  All Subscription Asset Manager users are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package. The update provides a script that modifies the elasticsearch.yml
  configuration file to disable dynamic scripting. After updating, run the
  "katello-configure" command. This will update the elasticsearch.yml
  configuration file and restart the elasticsearch service.
