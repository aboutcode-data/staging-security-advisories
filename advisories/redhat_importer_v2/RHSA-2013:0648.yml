  An update for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 which fixes
  multiple security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Web is the web container, based on Apache Tomcat, in JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It provides a single deployment platform for the
  JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlet technologies.

  It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
  protected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  prevention filter in JBoss Web. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  perform CSRF attacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention
  filter and do not contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)

  Multiple weaknesses were found in the JBoss Web DIGEST authentication
  implementation, effectively reducing the security normally provided by
  DIGEST authentication. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform
  replay attacks in some circumstances. (CVE-2012-5885, CVE-2012-5886,
  CVE-2012-5887)

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1 as provided from
  the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
