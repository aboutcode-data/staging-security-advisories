summary: |
  An update for php is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache HTTP Server.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way certain error conditions were handled by bzread() function in PHP. An attacker could use this flaw to upload a specially crafted bz2 archive which, when parsed via the vulnerable function, could cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the PHP application. (CVE-2016-5399)

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the imagecreatefromgd2() function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a PHP application or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that PHP application using gd via a specially crafted GD2 image. (CVE-2016-5766)

  * An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the gdImagePaletteToTrueColor() function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a PHP application or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that PHP application using gd via a specially crafted image buffer. (CVE-2016-5767)

  * A double free flaw was found in the mb_ereg_replace_callback() function of php which is used to perform regex search. This flaw could possibly cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2016-5768)

  Red Hat would like to thank Hans Jerry Illikainen for reporting CVE-2016-5399.
