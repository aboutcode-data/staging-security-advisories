  - CVE-2015-8863
summary: |
  An update for jq is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. jq is like sed for JSON data. You can use it to slice, filter, map, or transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep, or similar applications allow you to manipulate text.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in jq's tokenadd() function. By tricking a victim into processing a specially crafted JSON file, an attacker could use this flaw to crash jq or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. (CVE-2015-8863)
