summary: |
  Updated kernel-rt packages that fix multiple security issues and three bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.3.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  Security fixes:

  * Missing boundary checks in the PPP over L2TP sockets implementation could
  allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate
  their privileges. (CVE-2010-4160, Important)

  * Integer overflow in ib_uverbs_poll_cq() could allow a local, unprivileged
  user to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.
  (CVE-2010-4649, Important)

  * Missing boundary check in dvb_ca_ioctl() in the av7110 module. On systems
  using old DVB cards requiring the av7110 module, a local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2011-0521, Important)

  * Flaw in tcf_act_police_dump() in the network traffic policing
  implementation could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause an
  information leak. (CVE-2010-3477, Moderate)

  * Missing boundary checks in the block layer implementation could allow a
  local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4162,
  CVE-2010-4163, CVE-2010-4668, Moderate)

  * Divide-by-zero flaw in tcp_select_initial_window() in the Linux kernel's
  TCP/IP protocol suite implementation could allow a local, unprivileged user
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4165, Moderate)

  * NULL pointer dereference flaw in the Bluetooth HCI UART driver could
  allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-4242, Moderate)

  * Flaw in the CPU time clocks implementation for the POSIX clock interface
  could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.
  (CVE-2010-4248, Moderate)

  * Flaw in the garbage collector for AF_UNIX sockets could allow a local,
  unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (out-of-memory condition).
  (CVE-2010-4249, Moderate)

  * Memory leak in the inotify_init() system call. In some cases, it could
  leak a group, which could allow a local, unprivileged user to eventually
  cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-4250, Moderate)

  * /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/custom_method had world-writable permissions,
  which could allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their privileges.
  Note: The debugfs file system must be mounted locally to exploit this
  issue. It is not mounted by default. (CVE-2010-4347, Moderate)

  * Heap overflow in iowarrior_write() could allow a user with access to an
  IO-Warrior USB device to cause a denial of service or escalate their
  privileges. (CVE-2010-4656, Moderate)

  * Missing security check in the Linux kernel's implementation of the
  install_special_mapping routine could allow a local, unprivileged user to
  bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism. (CVE-2010-4346, Low)

  * Information leak in bcm_connect() in the Controller Area Network (CAN)
  Broadcast Manager implementation could allow a local, unprivileged user to
  leak kernel mode addresses in /proc/net/can-bcm. (CVE-2010-4565, Low)

  * A logic error in orinoco_ioctl_set_auth() in the Linux kernel's ORiNOCO
  wireless extensions support implementation could render TKIP
  countermeasures ineffective when it is enabled, as it enabled the card
  instead of shutting it down. (CVE-2010-4648, Low)

  * Missing initialization flaw in ethtool_get_regs() could allow a local
  user who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to cause an information leak.
  (CVE-2010-4655, Low)

  * Flaw in ib_uverbs_poll_cq() could allow a local, unprivileged user to
  cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1044, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2010-4160,
  CVE-2010-4162, CVE-2010-4163, CVE-2010-4668, and CVE-2010-4565; Steve Chen

  Nossum for reporting CVE-2010-4249 and CVE-2010-4250; Kees Cook for
  reporting CVE-2010-4656 and CVE-2010-4655; and Tavis Ormandy for reporting
  CVE-2010-4346.

  This update also fixes three bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will
  be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
  References section.
