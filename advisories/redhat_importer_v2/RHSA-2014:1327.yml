summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server. PHP's fileinfo module provides functions used to identify a
  particular file according to the type of data contained by the file.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the File Information (fileinfo)
  extension processed certain Pascal strings. A remote attacker able to make
  a PHP application using fileinfo convert a specially crafted Pascal string
  provided by an image file could cause that application to crash.
  (CVE-2014-3478)

  Multiple flaws were found in the File Information (fileinfo) extension
  regular expression rules for detecting various files. A remote attacker
  could use either of these flaws to cause a PHP application using fileinfo
  to consume an excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2014-3538)

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-1571 was incomplete; the File
  Information (fileinfo) extension did not correctly parse certain Composite
  Document Format (CDF) files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash
  a PHP application using fileinfo via a specially crafted CDF file.
  (CVE-2014-3587)

  It was found that PHP's gd extension did not properly handle file names
  with a null character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  make a PHP application access unexpected files and bypass intended file
  system access restrictions. (CVE-2014-5120)

  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
  function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
  file. (CVE-2014-2497)

  Multiple buffer over-read flaws were found in the php_parserr() function of
  PHP. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly
  use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP
  application used the dns_get_record() function to perform a DNS query.
  (CVE-2014-3597)

  Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
  PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
  could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
  server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

  The CVE-2014-3478 issue was discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat
  Product Security, the CVE-2014-3538 issue was discovered by Jan Kaluža of
  the Red Hat Web Stack Team, and the CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by
  David Kutálek of the Red Hat BaseOS QE.

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
  take effect.
