summary: "Updated httpd packages that include fixes for two security issues, as well as\nother\
  \ bugs, are now available.\n\nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient,\
  \ and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nAn issue has been discovered in the mod_ssl module\
  \ when configured to use\nthe \"SSLCipherSuite\" directive in directory or location context.\
  \  If a\nparticular location context has been configured to require a specific set\nof cipher\
  \ suites, then a client will be able to access that location using\nany cipher suite allowed\
  \ by the virtual host configuration.   The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0885 to this issue.\n\nAn issue has been discovered in the\
  \ handling of white space in request\nheader lines using MIME folding.  A malicious client\
  \ could send a carefully\ncrafted request, forcing the server to consume large amounts of\
  \ memory,\nleading to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0942 to this issue.\n\nSeveral minor bugs\
  \ were also discovered, including:\n\n- In the mod_cgi module, problems that arise when CGI\
  \ scripts are \n  invoked from SSI pages by mod_include using the \"#include virtual\" \n\
  \  syntax have been fixed.\n\n- In the mod_dav_fs module, problems with the handling of indirect\
  \ locks\n  on the S/390x platform have been fixed.\n\nUsers of the Apache HTTP server who\
  \ are affected by these issues should\nupgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\
  \ patches."
