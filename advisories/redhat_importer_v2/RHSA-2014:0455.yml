  - CVE-2014-0162
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away.
  Stored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running
  quickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  It was found that Sheepdog, a distributed object storage system, did not
  properly validate Sheepdog image URIs. A remote attacker able to insert or
  modify glance image metadata could use this flaw to execute arbitrary
  commands with the privileges of the user running the glance service.
  Note that only OpenStack Image setups using the Sheepdog back end were
  affected. (CVE-2014-0162)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Paul McMillan (Nebula) as the original reporter.

  All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue. After installing the updated packages,
  the running glance services will be restarted automatically.
