summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix several security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Application Stack v2.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Web server.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in PHP's mbstring extension. A
  remote attacker able to pass arbitrary input to a PHP script using mbstring
  conversion functions could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5557)

  A flaw was found in the handling of the "mbstring.func_overload"
  configuration setting. A value set for one virtual host, or in a user's
  .htaccess file, was incorrectly applied to other virtual hosts on the same
  server, causing the handling of multibyte character strings to not work
  correctly. (CVE-2009-0754)

  A directory traversal flaw was found in PHP's ZipArchive::extractTo
  function. If PHP is used to extract a malicious ZIP archive, it could allow
  an attacker to write arbitrary files anywhere the PHP process has write
  permissions. (CVE-2008-5658)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in PHP's imageloadfont function. If a PHP
  script allowed a remote attacker to load a carefully crafted font file, it
  could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  A flaw was found in the way PHP handled certain file extensions when
  running in FastCGI mode. If the PHP interpreter was being executed via
  FastCGI, a remote attacker could create a request which would cause the PHP
  interpreter to crash. (CVE-2008-3660)

  A memory disclosure flaw was found in the PHP gd extension's imagerotate
  function. A remote attacker able to pass arbitrary values as the
  "background color" argument of the function could, possibly, view portions
  of the PHP interpreter's memory. (CVE-2008-5498)

  A cross-site scripting flaw was found in a way PHP reported errors for
  invalid cookies. If the PHP interpreter had "display_errors" enabled, a
  remote attacker able to set a specially-crafted cookie on a victim's system
  could possibly inject arbitrary HTML into an error message generated by
  PHP. (CVE-2008-5814)

  A flaw was found in PHP's json_decode function. A remote attacker could use
  this flaw to create a specially-crafted string which could cause the PHP
  interpreter to crash while being decoded in a PHP script. (CVE-2009-1271)

  All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to resolve these issues. The httpd web server
  must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
