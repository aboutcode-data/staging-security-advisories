  Deprecations:
  * Nothing

  Technology Preview features:

  Bug fixes:
  * https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-2786
  * https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-2842

  Known issues:
  * Currently, when the OpenShift tenancy mode is enabled, the ServiceAccount of the gateway component of a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance requires the TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview permissions for authorization. Workaround: deploy the instance in a dedicated namespace, and carefully audit which users have permission to read the Secrets in this namespace.
