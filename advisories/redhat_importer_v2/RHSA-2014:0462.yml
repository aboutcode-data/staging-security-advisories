  - CVE-2014-0149
summary: |
  An update for the seam-remoting component of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework
  Kit 2.5.0 that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications. The JBoss Seam Remoting
  component provides a convenient method for remotely accessing Seam
  components from a web page, using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).

  It was found that JBoss Seam response envelopes included unsanitized
  parameter and ID names provided in the request. This allowed a request to
  inject arbitrary XML into the response. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to perform reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, provided the
  JBoss Seam remoting application did not use any cross-site request forgery
  (CSRF) protection. (CVE-2014-0149)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.5.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
