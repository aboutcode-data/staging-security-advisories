summary: |
  An update for JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.0 that fixes one security
  issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform is a business rules management system for
  the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss
  Rules.

  A flaw was found in the way Apache CXF verified that XML elements were
  signed or encrypted by a particular Supporting Token. Apache CXF checked to
  ensure these elements were signed or encrypted by a Supporting Token, but
  not whether the correct token was used. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to transmit confidential information without the appropriate security,
  and potentially circumvent access controls on web services exposed via
  Apache CXF. (CVE-2012-2379)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting this
  issue.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.
