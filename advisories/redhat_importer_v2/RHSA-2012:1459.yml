  - CVE-2011-2486
summary: |
  Updated nspluginwrapper packages that fix one security issue and one bug
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  nspluginwrapper is a utility which allows 32-bit plug-ins to run in a
  64-bit browser environment (a common example is Adobe's browser plug-in for
  presenting proprietary Flash files embedded in web pages). It includes the
  plug-in viewer and a tool for managing plug-in installations and updates.

  It was not possible for plug-ins wrapped by nspluginwrapper to discover
  whether the browser was running in Private Browsing mode. This flaw could
  lead to plug-ins wrapped by nspluginwrapper using normal mode while they
  were expected to run in Private Browsing mode. (CVE-2011-2486)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * When using the Adobe Reader web browser plug-in provided by the
  acroread-plugin package on a 64-bit system, opening Portable Document
  Format (PDF) files in Firefox could cause the plug-in to crash and a black
  window to be displayed where the PDF should be. Firefox had to be restarted
  to resolve the issue. This update implements a workaround in
  nspluginwrapper to automatically handle the plug-in crash, so that users
  no longer have to keep restarting Firefox. (BZ#869554)

  All users of nspluginwrapper are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which upgrade nspluginwrapper to upstream version 1.4.4, and
  correct these issues. After installing the update, Firefox must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
