summary: |
  Updated kdebase packages that resolve several security flaws are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The kdebase packages provide the core applications for KDE, the K Desktop
  Environment. These core packages include Konqueror, the web browser and
  file manager.

  These updated packages address the following vulnerabilities:

  Kees Huijgen found a flaw in the way KDM handled logins when autologin and
  "shutdown with password" were enabled.  A local user would have been able
  to login via KDM as any user without requiring a password. (CVE-2007-4569)

  Two Konqueror address spoofing flaws were discovered. A malicious web site
  could spoof the Konqueror address bar, tricking a victim into believing the
  page was from a different site. (CVE-2007-3820, CVE-2007-4224)

  Users of KDE should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
