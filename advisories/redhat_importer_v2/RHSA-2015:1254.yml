summary: |
  Updated curl packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
  add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for
  downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP,
  FTP, and LDAP.

  It was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial
  literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker able
  to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use this flaw
  to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other cookie-related
  issues easier to exploit. (CVE-2014-3613)

  A flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the duplication
  of connection handles. If an application set the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS
  option for a handle, using the handle's duplicate could cause the
  application to crash or disclose a portion of its memory. (CVE-2014-3707)

  It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle URLs
  with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an
  application using libcurl to access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP
  proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the request or
  construct additional requests. (CVE-2014-8150)

  It was discovered that libcurl implemented aspects of the NTLM and
  Negotatiate authentication incorrectly. If an application uses libcurl
  and the affected mechanisms in a specifc way, certain requests to a
  previously NTLM-authenticated server could appears as sent by the wrong
  authenticated user. Additionally, the initial set of credentials for HTTP
  Negotiate-authenticated requests could be reused in subsequent requests,
  although a different set of credentials was specified. (CVE-2015-3143,
  CVE-2015-3148)

  Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these issues.

  Bug fixes:

  * An out-of-protocol fallback to SSL version 3.0 (SSLv3.0) was available
  with libcurl. Attackers could abuse the fallback to force downgrade of the
  SSL version. The fallback has been removed from libcurl. Users requiring
  this functionality can explicitly enable SSLv3.0 through the libcurl API.
  (BZ#1154059)

  * A single upload transfer through the FILE protocol opened the destination
  file twice. If the inotify kernel subsystem monitored the file, two events
  were produced unnecessarily. The file is now opened only once per upload.
  (BZ#883002)

  * Utilities using libcurl for SCP/SFTP transfers could terminate
  unexpectedly when the system was running in FIPS mode. (BZ#1008178)

  * Using the "--retry" option with the curl utility could cause curl to
  terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now, adding "--retry" no
  longer causes curl to crash. (BZ#1009455)

  * The "curl --trace-time" command did not use the correct local time when
  printing timestamps. Now, "curl --trace-time" works as expected.
  (BZ#1120196)

  * The valgrind utility could report dynamically allocated memory leaks on
  curl exit. Now, curl performs a global shutdown of the NetScape Portable
  Runtime (NSPR) library on exit, and valgrind no longer reports the memory
  leaks. (BZ#1146528)

  * Previously, libcurl returned an incorrect value of the
  CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE field when a proxy server appended its own headers to
  the HTTP response. Now, the returned value is valid. (BZ#1161163)

  Enhancements:

  * The "--tlsv1.0", "--tlsv1.1", and "--tlsv1.2" options are available for
  specifying the minor version of the TLS protocol to be negotiated by NSS.
  The "--tlsv1" option now negotiates the highest version of the TLS protocol
  supported by both the client and the server. (BZ#1012136)

  * It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable the ECC and the new
  AES cipher suites to be used for TLS. (BZ#1058767, BZ#1156422)

  All curl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
  enhancements.
