  - CVE-2011-1091
  - CVE-2011-3594
summary: |
  Updated pidgin packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
  accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the way the Pidgin SILC (Secure
  Internet Live Conferencing) protocol plug-in escaped certain UTF-8
  characters. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Pidgin via a
  specially-crafted SILC message. (CVE-2011-3594)

  Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the way the Pidgin
  Yahoo! Messenger Protocol plug-in handled malformed YMSG packets. A remote
  attacker could use these flaws to crash Pidgin via a specially-crafted
  notification message. (CVE-2011-1091)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Pidgin project for reporting CVE-2011-1091.
  Upstream acknowledges Marius Wachtler as the original reporter of
  CVE-2011-1091.

  All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. Pidgin must be restarted for
  this update to take effect.
