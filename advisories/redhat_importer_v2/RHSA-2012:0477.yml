summary: |
  An updated MRG Management Console package that fixes several security
  issues is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  Several cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the MRG Management
  Console (Cumin). An authorized user on the local network could use these
  flaws to perform cross-site scripting attacks against MRG Management
  Console users. Note: Refer to the MRG Messaging User Guide for information
  on configuring authentication and authorization in the MRG Messaging
  broker. (CVE-2012-1575)

  Users of Red Hat Enterprise MRG Management Console are advised to upgrade
  to this updated package, which corrects these issues. The MRG Management
  Console must be restarted ("service cumin restart") for this update to take
  effect.
