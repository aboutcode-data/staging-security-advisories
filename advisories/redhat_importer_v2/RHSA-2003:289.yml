  - CVE-2003-0690
  - CVE-2003-0730
summary: "Updated XFree86 packages provide security fixes to font libraries and XDM.\n\nXFree86\
  \ is an implementation of the X Window System providing the core\ngraphical user interface\
  \ and video drivers. XDM is the X display manager.\n\nMultiple integer overflows in the transfer\
  \ and enumeration of font\nlibraries in XFree86 allow local or remote attackers to cause a\
  \ denial of\nservice or execute arbitrary code via heap-based and stack-based buffer\noverflow\
  \ attacks.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2003-0730 to this issue.  \n\nThe risk to users from this vulnerability is\
  \  limited because only clients\ncan be affected by these bugs, however in some (non-default)\n\
  configurations, both xfs and the X Server can act as clients\nto remote font servers.\n\n\
  XDM does not verify whether the pam_setcred function call succeeds, which\nmay allow attackers\
  \ to gain root privileges by triggering error conditions\nwithin PAM modules, as demonstrated\
  \ in certain configurations of the\npam_krb5 module.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0690 to this issue.  \n\nUsers are\
  \ advised to upgrade to these updated XFree86 4.1.0 packages, which\ncontain backported security\
  \ patches and are not vulnerable to these issues."
