summary: "Updated BIND packages that fix a number of vulnerabilities are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.\n\nISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain)\
  \ is an implementation of the DNS\n(Domain Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server\
  \ (named),\nwhich resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library\n(routines for applications\
  \ to use when interfacing with DNS); and\nvarious tools.\n \nA buffer overflow vulnerability\
  \ exists in multiple implementations of the\nDNS resolver libraries.  Applications that utilize\
  \ vulnerable DNS resolver\nlibraries may be affected.  A remote attacker who is able to send\
  \ malicious\nDNS responses could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute\narbitrary\
  \ code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. \n\nRed Hat Linux does not ship\
  \ with any applications or libraries that link \nagainst the BIND resolver libraries; however,\
  \ third party code may be affected.\n\nVersions of BIND 9 prior to 9.2.1 have a bug that causes\
  \ certain requests\nto the BIND name server (named) to fail an internal consistency check,\n\
  causing the name server to stop responding to requests.  This can be used\nby a remote attacker\
  \ to cause a denial of service (DOS) attack against name\nservers.\n\nThe updated bind packages\
  \ included in this errata contain Bind 9.2.1 with\nthe addition of backported patches and\
  \ is not vulnerable to these issues."
