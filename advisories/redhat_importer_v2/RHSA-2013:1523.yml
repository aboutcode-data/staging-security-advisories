  - CVE-2013-4287
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-ruby packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat OpenStack 3.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
  has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.
  RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third-party
  libraries.

  It was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an
  unsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process
  a version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial
  of service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)

  Red Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter.

  Users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct this issue.
