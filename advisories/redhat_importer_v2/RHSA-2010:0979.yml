  - CVE-2010-4180
summary: |
  Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  A ciphersuite downgrade flaw was found in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code.
  A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to change the ciphersuite
  associated with a cached session stored on the server, if the server
  enabled the SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG option, possibly
  forcing the client to use a weaker ciphersuite after resuming the session.
  (CVE-2010-4180)

  Note: With this update, setting the SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG
  option has no effect and this bug workaround can no longer be enabled.

  All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to resolve this issue. For the update to take effect, all
  services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system
  rebooted.
