  - CVE-2013-0334
summary: |
  Updated rubygem-bundler and rubygem-thor packages that fix one security
  issue, several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Bundler manages an application's dependencies through its entire life,
  across many machines, systematically and repeatably. Thor is a toolkit for
  building powerful command-line interfaces.

  A flaw was found in the way Bundler handled gems available from multiple
  sources. An attacker with access to one of the sources could create a
  malicious gem with the same name, which they could then use to trick a user
  into installing, potentially resulting in execution of code from the
  attacker-supplied malicious gem. (CVE-2013-0334)

  Bundler has been upgraded to upstream version 1.7.8 and Thor has been
  upgraded to upstream version 1.19.1, both of which provide a number of bug
  fixes and enhancements over the previous versions. (BZ#1194243, BZ#1209921)

  All rubygem-bundler and rubygem-thor users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
