  - CVE-2007-1007
summary: |
  Updated gnomemeeting packages that fix a security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  GnomeMeeting is a tool to communicate with video and audio over the Internet.

  A format string flaw was found in the way GnomeMeeting processes certain
  messages. If a user is running GnomeMeeting, a remote attacker who can
  connect to GnomeMeeting could trigger this flaw and potentially execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. (CVE-2007-1007)

  Users of GnomeMeeting should upgrade to these updated packages which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
