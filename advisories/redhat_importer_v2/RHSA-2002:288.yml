summary: |
  Updated MySQL packages are available for Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3,
  and 8.0 which fix security vulnerabilities found in the MySQL server.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. While auditing
  MySQL, Stefan Esser found security vulnerabilities that can be used to
  crash the server or allow MySQL users to gain privileges.

  A signed integer vulnerability in the COM_TABLE_DUMP package for MySQL
  3.x to 3.23.53a  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (crash or hang) in mysqld by causing large negative integers to be provided
  to a memcpy call.  (CAN-2002-1373)

  The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to
  4.0.5a allows a remote attacker to gain privileges via a brute force
  attack using a one-character password, which causes MySQL to only compare
  the provided password against the first character of the real
  password. (CAN-2002-1374)

  The COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to
  4.0.5a allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
  response.  (CAN-2002-1375)

  The MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x
  to 4.0.5a does not properly verify length fields for certain responses
  in the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which allows a malicious server
  to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
  code.  (CAN-2002-1376)

  Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 contain versions of MySQL that
  are vulnerable to these issues. All users of MySQL are advised to upgrade
  to the erratum packages containing MySQL 3.23.54a which is not vulnerable
  to these issues.
