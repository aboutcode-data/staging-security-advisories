summary: |
  Updated images are now available for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for
  Kubernetes (RHACS). The updated image includes new features and security and bug fixes.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact
  of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  This release of RHACS includes new features and security and bug fixes. If you are
  using an earlier version of RHACS, you are advised to upgrade to this
  release 4.7.0.

  New features:

  For a list of new features and information about them, see: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.7/html-single/release_notes/index#release-notes-47

  Bugs fixed:

  * Before this update, reports remained in the DOWNLOAD state even after they were downloaded. This issue is now fixed.

  * Before this update, the logs repeatedly displayed the following error message:

  "[Throttled] Could not determine network namespace: No such file or directory"

  This issue occurred when the system reported errors when encountering zombie processes. With this update, the system now specifically recognizes zombie processes and adjusts the message level to a less strict classification. However, the system can still trigger an error if the detection of zombie processes exceeds a certain threshold, helping to identify faulty workloads.

  * Before this update, the Central logs were not rotated, which caused the log file for RHACS to grow indefinitely and eventually take up the entire node memory. This issue occurred because /var/log/stackrox was mounted by using an emptyDir volume, which does not persist across pod restarts and has no built-in log rotation.

  With this update, logs are deleted and the emptyDir volume is recreated when you restart the Central pod. A log size limit has been introduced to prevent excessive memory usage and to ensure that the Central logs do not overload the node.

  * Before this update, Central might have filtered out selected storage.IndexReport messages representing the state of the RPM packages on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) node due to missing timestamps.

  This caused issues in RHACS 4.6.0 and 4.6.1 when testing the technical preview feature of RHCOS node scanning with Scanner V4. With this update, the filter logic in Central has been adjusted to ensure that IndexReport messages are processed correctly over time.

  * Before to this update, the RHACS portal incorrectly validated Slack webhook URLs and blocked the Mattermost integration due to strict regex rules. With this update, the regex check has been removed to allow for more flexible URL formats.

  Security vulnerabilities fixed:

  * axios: exposure of confidential data stored in cookies (CVE-2023-45857)
