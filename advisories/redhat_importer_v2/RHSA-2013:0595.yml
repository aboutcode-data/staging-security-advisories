summary: |
  An updated openstack-packstack package that fixes two security issues and
  several bugs is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PackStack is a command line utility that uses Puppet modules to support
  rapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection.
  PackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof of concept
  installations and more complex multi-node installations.

  A flaw was found in PackStack. During manifest creation, the manifest file
  was written to /tmp/ with a predictable file name. A local attacker could
  use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting an arbitrary
  file accessible to the user running PackStack with the contents of the
  manifest, which could lead to a denial of service. Additionally, the
  attacker could read and potentially modify the manifest being generated,
  allowing them to modify systems being deployed using OpenStack.
  (CVE-2013-0261)

  It was discovered that the cinder.conf and all api-paste.ini configuration
  files were created with world-readable permissions. A local attacker could
  use this flaw to view administrative passwords, allowing them to control
  systems deployed and managed by OpenStack. (CVE-2013-0266)

  The CVE-2013-0261 issue was discovered by Kurt Seifried of the Red Hat
  Security Response Team, and CVE-2013-0266 was discovered by Derek Higgins
  of the Red Hat OpenStack team.

  This update also fixes several bugs in the openstack-packstack package.

  All users of openstack-packstack are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which corrects these issues.
