  - CVE-2013-4157
summary: |
  Updated Red Hat Storage 2.0 packages that fix multiple security issues,
  various bugs, and add one enhancement are now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Storage is a software only, scale-out storage solution that
  provides flexible and agile unstructured data storage for the enterprise.

  Multiple insecure temporary file creation flaws were found in Red Hat
  Storage server. A local user on the Red Hat Storage server could use these
  flaws to cause arbitrary files to be overwritten as the root user via a
  symbolic link attack. (CVE-2013-4157)

  These issues were discovered by Gowrishankar Rajaiyan of Red Hat and Kurt
  Seifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, rolling upgrades on a volume caused some processes to abort
  which led to a possible corruption of the volume. Yum update aborts with a
  message to stop the volume during an update. Now, with this update rolling
  upgrades is not supported and it is mandatory to stop the volume before any
  'yum update'. (BZ#998649)

  *  Installing or upgrading the gluster-swift-plugin RPM overwrites
  /etc/swift configuration files. Hence, the customer configuration is
  overwritten, causing data unavailability. Now, the RPM installs or upgrades
  new configuration files with a non-conflicting extension and customer
  configuration files are not overwritten, maintaining data availability.
  (BZ#997940, BZ#1000423)

  This update also adds the following enhancement:

  * A new upgrade script has been added. When Red Hat Storage Server 2.1 is
  released, this script will help users upgrade and resubscribe their
  Red Hat Storage Server 2.0 Update 6 systems to Red Hat Storage Server 2.1.
  (BZ#1002872)

  All users of Red Hat Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages.
