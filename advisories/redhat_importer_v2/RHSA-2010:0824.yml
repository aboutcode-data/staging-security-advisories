summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix three security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
  the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

  It was found that the MySQL PolyFromWKB() function did not sanity check
  Well-Known Binary (WKB) data. A remote, authenticated attacker could use
  specially-crafted WKB data to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a
  temporary denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after
  the crash. (CVE-2010-3840)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed certain alternating READ
  requests provided by HANDLER statements. A remote, authenticated attacker
  could use this flaw to provide such requests, causing mysqld to crash. This
  issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was
  automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3681)

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way MySQL handled the
  parameters of the MySQL COM_FIELD_LIST network protocol command. A remote,
  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to obtain descriptions of the
  fields of an arbitrary table using a request with a specially-crafted
  table name. (CVE-2010-1848)

  All MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.
