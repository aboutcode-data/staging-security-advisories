summary: |
  Updated qspice packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing
  virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
  hypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.

  It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not
  validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card
  driver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to
  dereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of
  service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
  their privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)

  It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be
  forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses
  controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
  the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on
  the host. (CVE-2010-0429)

  All qspice users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
