  - CVE-2011-2504
summary: |
  Updated core client packages for the X Window System that fix one security
  issue, several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Core X11 clients packages provide the xorg-x11-utils,
  xorg-x11-server-utils, and xorg-x11-apps clients that ship with the X
  Window System.

  It was found that the x11perfcomp utility included the current working
  directory in its PATH environment variable. Running x11perfcomp in an
  attacker-controlled directory would cause arbitrary code execution with
  the privileges of the user running x11perfcomp. (CVE-2011-2504)

  Also with this update, the xorg-x11-utils and xorg-x11-server-utils
  packages have been upgraded to upstream version 7.5, and the xorg-x11-apps
  package to upstream version 7.6, which provides a number of bug fixes and
  enhancements over the previous versions. (BZ#835277, BZ#835278, BZ#835281)

  All users of xorg-x11-utils, xorg-x11-server-utils, and xorg-x11-apps are
  advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these issues and
  add these enhancements.
