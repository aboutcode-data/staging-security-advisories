summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.0, which fixes multiple security
  issues, various bugs, and adds enhancements is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the
  Java EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise
  customers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise
  Middleware components that have been tested and certified together to
  provide an integrated experience.

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.0 serves as a
  replacement for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.1, and includes bug
  fixes and enhancements. Refer to the JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.0
  Release Notes for information on the most significant of these changes. The
  Release Notes will be available shortly from
  https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in JBoss Enterprise
  Portal Platform. If a remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged
  into the portal, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, it would lead to
  arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's portal
  session. (CVE-2011-4580)

  It was found that the login page of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform could
  be used to perform open URL redirects. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to redirect users to arbitrary websites and conduct phishing attacks
  via a URL passed in the initialURI parameter. (CVE-2011-2941)

  It was found that the invoker servlets, deployed by default via
  httpha-invoker, only performed access control on the HTTP GET and POST
  methods, allowing remote attackers to make unauthenticated requests by
  using different HTTP methods. Due to the second layer of authentication
  provided by a security interceptor, this issue is not exploitable on
  default installations unless an administrator has misconfigured the
  security interceptor or disabled it. (CVE-2011-4085)

  Red Hat would like to thank Christopher Hartley of The Ohio State
  University for reporting the CVE-2011-2941 issue.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration
  files.

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.1.1 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Portal
  Platform 5.2.0.
