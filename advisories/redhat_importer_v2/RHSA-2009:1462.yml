  - CVE-2009-2412
summary: |
  Updated httpd22 packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server. The httpd22 packages
  shipped with JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4 contain embedded copies of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) libraries,
  which provide a free library of C data structures and routines, and also
  additional utility interfaces to support XML parsing, LDAP, database
  interfaces, URI parsing, and more.

  Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
  were found in the way the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) manages memory pool
  and relocatable memory allocations. An attacker could use these flaws to
  issue a specially-crafted request for memory allocation, which would lead
  to a denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of an application using the APR
  libraries. (CVE-2009-2412)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 should upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
  After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted
  for the update to take effect.
