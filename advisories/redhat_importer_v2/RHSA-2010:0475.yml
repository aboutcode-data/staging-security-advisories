  - CVE-2010-1646
summary: |
  An updated sudo package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
  certain users the ability to run commands as root.

  A flaw was found in the way sudo handled the presence of duplicated
  environment variables. A local user authorized to run commands using sudo
  could use this flaw to set additional values for the environment variables
  set by sudo, which could result in those values being used by the executed
  command instead of the values set by sudo. This could possibly lead to
  certain intended restrictions being bypassed, such as the secure_path
  setting. (CVE-2010-1646)

  Red Hat would like to thank Anders Kaseorg and Evan Broder of Ksplice, Inc.
  for responsibly reporting this issue.

  Users of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
