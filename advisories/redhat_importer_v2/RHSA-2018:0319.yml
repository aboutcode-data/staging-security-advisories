summary: "An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Fuse and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint, flexible, open\
  \ source enterprise service bus and integration platform. \n\nRed Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on\
  \ Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant messaging system that is tailored for use in mission\
  \ critical applications.\n\nThis patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.3 and Red Hat\
  \ JBoss A-MQ 6.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the readme.txt\
  \ file included with the patch files.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was found that spring-ldap\
  \ contains a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to authenticate with arbitrary\
  \ password. When spring-ldap connected to some LDAP servers, and when no additional attributes\
  \ are bound, and when using LDAP BindAuthenticator with org.springframework.ldap.core.support.DefaultTlsDirContextAuthenticationStrategy\
  \ as the authentication strategy, and setting userSearch, authentication is allowed with an\
  \ arbitrary password when the username is correct. (CVE-2017-8028)\n\n* It was found that\
  \ a flaw in hawtio could cause remote code execution via file upload. An attacker could use\
  \ this vulnerability to upload crafted file which could be executed on target machine where\
  \ hawtio is deployed. (CVE-2017-2617)\n\n* It was found that Apache Camel contains a security\
  \ vulnerability via camel-hessian component. An attacker can utilize this flaw to deserialize\
  \ malicious object on the target machine which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\
  \ (CVE-2017-12633)\n\n* It was found that Apache Camel contains a security vulnerability via\
  \ camel-castor component. An attacker can utilize this flaw to deserialize malicious object\
  \ on the target machine which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). (CVE-2017-12634)\n\
  \n* It was found that a flaw exists in Switchyard component via Apache Batick. If an attacker\
  \ sends a maliciously crafted SVG formed file on the target machine, that uses batik, files\
  \ lying on the file system could be revealed to the attacker, depending on the user context\
  \ in which the exploitable application is running. This flaw can also be leveraged to attack\
  \ the availability of the target machine via DoS. (CVE-2017-5662)\n\nThe CVE-2017-2617 issue\
  \ was discovered by Hooman Broujerdi (Red Hat)."
