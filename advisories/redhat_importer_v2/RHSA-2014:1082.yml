  - CVE-2014-3577
summary: |
  Updated thermostat1-httpcomponents-client packages that fix one security
  issue are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  [Updated 25 August 2014]
  This erratum previously incorrectly listed the CVE-2012-6153 issue as
  addressed by this update. However, that issue did not affect the
  thermostat1-httpcomponents-client packages.

  Thermostat is a monitoring and instrumentation tool for the OpenJDK HotSpot
  Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with support for monitoring multiple
  JVM instances.

  The httpcomponents-client package provides an HTTP agent implementation
  that is used by Thermostat to visualize collected data in an HTTP-aware
  client application.

  It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added
  to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's
  Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
  using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

  For additional information on this flaw, refer to the Knowledgebase
  article in the References section.

  All thermostat1-httpcomponents-client users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
