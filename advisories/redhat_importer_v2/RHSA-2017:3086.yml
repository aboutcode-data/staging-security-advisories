summary: |
  This is the final notification for the End Of Life (EOL) of Red Hat 'Stand-Alone' Proxy.

  Red Hat Proxy ‘Stand-Alone’ (Proxy server directly connecting to the Red Hat Network): Systems registered as clients to RHN via a Red Hat Satellite Proxy server is no longer a Red Hat supported deployment, and will no longer function as required.

  Access a set of instructions for moving from Proxy to Satellite 6: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2859521. This guide describes the process for a Proxy-only user to install and configure a Satellite 6 installation and migrate clients to it.
