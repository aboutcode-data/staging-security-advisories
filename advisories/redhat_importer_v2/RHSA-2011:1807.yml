  - CVE-2011-4517
summary: |
  Updated jasper packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  JasPer is an implementation of Part 1 of the JPEG 2000 image compression
  standard.

  Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded
  JPEG 2000 compressed image files. An attacker could create a malicious JPEG
  2000 compressed image file that, when opened, would cause applications that
  use JasPer (such as Nautilus) to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
  code. (CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jonathan Foote of the CERT Coordination Center
  for reporting these issues.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct these issues. All applications using the JasPer
  libraries (such as Nautilus) must be restarted for the update to take
  effect.
