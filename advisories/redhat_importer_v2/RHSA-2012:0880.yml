  - CVE-2011-3922
summary: |
  Updated qt packages that fix two security issues and three bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Qt is a software toolkit that simplifies the task of writing and
  maintaining GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications for the X Window
  System. HarfBuzz is an OpenType text shaping engine.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the harfbuzz module in Qt. If a user
  loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against Qt,
  it could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running the application.
  (CVE-2011-3922)

  A flaw was found in the way Qt handled X.509 certificates with IP address
  wildcards. An attacker able to obtain a certificate with a Common Name
  containing an IP wildcard could possibly use this flaw to impersonate an
  SSL server to client applications that are using Qt. This update also
  introduces more strict handling for hostname wildcard certificates by
  disallowing the wildcard character to match more than one hostname
  component. (CVE-2010-5076)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The Phonon API allowed premature freeing of the media object.
  Consequently, GStreamer could terminate unexpectedly as it failed to access
  the released media object. This update modifies the underlying Phonon API
  code and the problem no longer occurs. (BZ#694684)

  * Previously, Qt could output the "Unrecognized OpenGL version" error and
  fall back to OpenGL-version-1 compatibility mode. This happened because Qt
  failed to recognize the version of OpenGL installed on the system if the
  system was using a version of OpenGL released later than the Qt version in
  use. This update adds the code for recognition of OpenGL versions to Qt and
  if the OpenGL version is unknown, Qt assumes that the last-known version of
  OpenGL is available. (BZ#757793)

  * Previously Qt included a compiled-in list of trusted CA (Certificate
  Authority) certificates, that could have been used if Qt failed to open a
  system's ca-bundle.crt file. With this update, Qt no longer includes
  compiled-in CA certificates and only uses the system bundle. (BZ#734444)

  Users of Qt should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. All running applications linked
  against Qt libraries must be restarted for this update to take effect.
