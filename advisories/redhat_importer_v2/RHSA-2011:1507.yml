  - CVE-2011-1778
summary: |
  Updated libarchive packages that fix two security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libarchive programming library can create and read several different
  streaming archive formats, including GNU tar and cpio. It can also read ISO
  9660 CD-ROM images.

  Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were discovered in libarchive. If a
  user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted ISO 9660 CD-ROM image
  or tar archive with an application using libarchive, it could cause the
  application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-1777,
  CVE-2011-1778)

  All libarchive users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  applications using libarchive must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
