  - CVE-2014-6271
summary: |
  Updated bash Shift_JIS packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The GNU Bourne Again shell (Bash) is a shell and command language
  interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell (sh). Bash is the default
  shell for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

  Shift_JIS, also known as "SJIS", is a character encoding for the Japanese
  language. This package provides bash support for the Shift_JIS encoding.

  A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
  environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
  bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain
  services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
  provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.
  (CVE-2014-6271)

  For additional information on the CVE-2014-6271 flaw, refer to the
  Knowledgebase article at https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223

  Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting this issue.

  All users who require Shift_JIS encoding support with Bash built-in
  functions are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
