  - CVE-2014-0160
summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 3.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Important: This update is an emergency security fix being provided outside
  the scope of the published support policy for Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization listed in the References section. In accordance with the
  support policy for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Hypervisor 3.2 will not receive future security updates.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  An information disclosure flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS and
  DTLS Heartbeat Extension packets. A malicious TLS or DTLS client or server
  could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS Heartbeat packet to disclose a
  limited portion of memory per request from a connected client or server.
  Note that the disclosed portions of memory could potentially include
  sensitive information such as private keys. (CVE-2014-0160)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Neel Mehta of Google Security as the original
  reporter.

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects this issue.
