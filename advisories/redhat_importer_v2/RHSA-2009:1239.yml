summary: "Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues and various\nbugs are\
  \ now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\n[Updated 1st Sep 2009]\nThis\
  \ erratum originally stated that these updated kernel packages corrected\nthe issue CVE-2009-1895.\
  \ This was a mistake as the kernel packages do not\ncontain a fix for this issue. CVE-2009-1895\
  \ will be addressed in a future \nupdate.\n\nThe kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel,\
  \ the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThese updated packages fix the following security\
  \ issues:\n\n* Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team reported a\nflaw\
  \ in the SOCKOPS_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This macro did not\ninitialize the sendpage\
  \ operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. A\nlocal, unprivileged user could use this\
  \ flaw to cause a local denial of\nservice or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2692, Important)\n\
  \n* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear_child_tid\npointer in\
  \ the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a\nwritable portion of the memory\
  \ of the new program, the kernel could corrupt\nfour bytes of memory, possibly leading to\
  \ a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)\n\n* a flaw\
  \ was found in the way the do_sigaltstack() function in the Linux\nkernel copies the stack_t\
  \ structure to user-space. On 64-bit machines, this\nflaw could lead to a four-byte information\
  \ leak. (CVE-2009-2847, Moderate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the gcc\
  \ flag \"-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks\" was added to the kernel\nbuild options. This prevents\
  \ gcc from optimizing out NULL pointer checks\nafter the first use of a pointer. NULL pointer\
  \ bugs are often exploited by\nattackers, and keeping these checks is considered a safety\
  \ measure.\n(BZ#511187) \n\n* a bug in the locking strategy for the free_pages_bulk() kernel\
  \ function\nwas found, where a lock in a code branch was not held. This could have\ncreated\
  \ a \"double free\" problem that resulted in a kernel panic.\n(BZ#513715)\n\n* udevd and multipathd\
  \ were unable to service events fast enough when a\nFibre Channel cable was unplugged. This\
  \ caused the cable state to be out of\nsync if the cable was plugged back in quickly, possibly\
  \ resulting in\ndevices being removed, or path issues when using Device-Mapper Multipath.\n\
  This has been changed so that users can specify devices that should not be\nremoved if a cable\
  \ is unplugged. (BZ#514541)\n\n* a race condition in exit_thread() could have eventually caused\
  \ a kernel\noops. (BZ#514587)\n\n* a race condition was fixed between kthread_stop() and kthread_create().\n\
  Kernel subsystems creating and stopping threads at a fast pace could hit\nthis issue. Several\
  \ inexplicable backtraces observed during tests\ncaused this race condition. (BZ#518967)\n\
  \n* HPET_EMULATE_RTC was being disabled during kernel compile. This was\ncaused by an incorrect\
  \ requirement in the related Kconfig entry. This issue\nled to failures when accessing the\
  \ RTC (real time clock) in machines that\nhad the RTC emulated by HPET (High Precision Event\
  \ Timer). (BZ#519433)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\n\
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect."
