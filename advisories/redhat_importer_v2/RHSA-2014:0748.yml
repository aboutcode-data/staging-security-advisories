  - CVE-2014-1402
summary: |
  Updated python33-python-jinja2 and python27-python-jinja2 packages that fix
  one security issue are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a
  Django-inspired, non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an
  optional sandboxed environment.

  It was discovered that Jinja2 did not properly handle bytecode cache files
  stored in the system's temporary directory. A local attacker could use this
  flaw to alter the output of an application using Jinja2 and
  FileSystemBytecodeCache, and potentially execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of that application. (CVE-2014-1402)

  All Jinja2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
  effect, all applications using Jinja2 must be restarted.
