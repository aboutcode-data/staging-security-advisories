summary: |
  An updated sudo package that fixes two security issues is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give
  certain users the ability to run commands as root.

  A privilege escalation flaw was found in the way sudo handled the sudoedit
  pseudo-command. If a local user were authorized by the sudoers file to use
  this pseudo-command, they could possibly leverage this flaw to execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the root user. (CVE-2010-0426)

  The sudo utility did not properly initialize supplementary groups when the
  "runas_default" option (in the sudoers file) was used. If a local user
  were authorized by the sudoers file to perform their sudo commands under
  the account specified with "runas_default", they would receive the root
  user's supplementary groups instead of those of the intended target user,
  giving them unintended privileges. (CVE-2010-0427)

  Users of sudo should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to correct these issues.
