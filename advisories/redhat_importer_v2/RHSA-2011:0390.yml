  - CVE-2011-1097
summary: |
  An updated rsync package that fixes one security issue is now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  rsync is a program for synchronizing files over a network.

  A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the rsync client processed
  malformed file list data. If an rsync client used the "--recursive" and
  "--delete" options without the "--owner" option when connecting to a
  malicious rsync server, the malicious server could cause rsync on the
  client system to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running rsync. (CVE-2011-1097)

  Red Hat would like to thank Wayne Davison and Matt McCutchen for reporting
  this issue.

  Users of rsync should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
  backported patch to resolve this issue.
