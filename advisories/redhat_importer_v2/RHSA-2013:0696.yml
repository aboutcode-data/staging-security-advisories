summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2013-0788)

  A flaw was found in the way Same Origin Wrappers were implemented in
  Firefox. A malicious site could use this flaw to bypass the same-origin
  policy and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2013-0795)

  A flaw was found in the embedded WebGL library in Firefox. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
  Note: This issue only affected systems using the Intel Mesa graphics
  drivers. (CVE-2013-0796)

  An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the embedded Cairo library in
  Firefox. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running Firefox. (CVE-2013-0800)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the JavaScript history
  functions. A malicious site could cause a web page to be displayed that has
  a baseURI pointing to a different site, allowing cross-site scripting (XSS)
  and phishing attacks. (CVE-2013-0793)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
  Upstream acknowledges Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian
  Holler, Milan Sreckovic, Joe Drew, Cody Crews, miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, and
  Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 17.0.5 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 17.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
