summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-4513, CVE-2015-7189, CVE-2015-7197, CVE-2015-7198,
  CVE-2015-7199, CVE-2015-7200)

  A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled
  certain cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) requests. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to disclose sensitive
  information. (CVE-2015-7193)

  Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
  HTML mail message because JavaScript is disabled by default for mail
  messages. However, they could be exploited in other ways in Thunderbird
  (for example, by viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed).

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson
  Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff
  Walden, Gary Kwong, Looben Yang, Shinto K Anto, Ronald Crane, and Ehsan
  Akhgari as the original reporters of these issues.

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Thunderbird 38.4.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains Thunderbird version 38.4.0, which corrects these issues. After
  installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
  take effect.
