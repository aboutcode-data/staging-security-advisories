summary: |
  Updated samba4 packages that fix three security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
  Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
  machines to share files, printers, and other information.

  It was found that certain Samba configurations did not enforce the password
  lockout mechanism. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
  password guessing attacks on Samba user accounts. Note: this flaw only
  affected Samba when deployed as a Primary Domain Controller.
  (CVE-2013-4496)

  A flaw was found in Samba's "smbcacls" command, which is used to set or get
  ACLs on SMB file shares. Certain command line options of this command would
  incorrectly remove an ACL previously applied on a file or a directory,
  leaving the file or directory without the intended ACL. (CVE-2013-6442)

  A flaw was found in the way the pam_winbind module handled configurations
  that specified a non-existent group as required. An authenticated user
  could possibly use this flaw to gain access to a service using pam_winbind
  in its PAM configuration when group restriction was intended for access to
  the service. (CVE-2012-6150)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2013-4496
  and CVE-2013-6442, and Sam Richardson for reporting CVE-2012-6150.
  Upstream acknowledges Andrew Bartlett as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-4496, and Noel Power as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6442.

  All users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.
