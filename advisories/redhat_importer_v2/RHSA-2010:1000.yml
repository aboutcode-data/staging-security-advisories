  - CVE-2010-3613
summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  It was discovered that named did not invalidate previously cached SIG
  records when adding an NCACHE record for the same entry to the cache. A
  remote attacker allowed to send recursive DNS queries to named could use
  this flaw to crash named. (CVE-2010-3613)

  All BIND users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
  update, the BIND daemon (named) will be restarted automatically.
