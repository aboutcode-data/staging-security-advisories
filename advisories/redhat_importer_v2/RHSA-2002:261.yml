  - CVE-2002-1159
summary: "The Canna server, used for Japanese character input, has two security\nvulnerabilities\
  \ including an exploitable buffer overflow that allows a local\nuser to gain 'bin' user privileges.\
  \ Updated packages for Red Hat Linux\nAdvanced Server are available.\n\n[Updated 13 Jan 2003]\n\
  Added fixed packages for the Itanium (IA64) architecture.\n\n[Updated 06 Feb 2003]\nAdded\
  \ fixed packages for Advanced Workstation 2.1\n\nCanna is a kana-kanji conversion server which\
  \ is necessary for Japanese\nlanguage character input. \n\nA buffer overflow bug in the Canna\
  \ server up to and including version 3.5b2\nallows a local user to gain the privileges of\
  \ the user 'bin' which can\nlead to further exploits. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1158 to this issue.\n\nIn addition,\
  \ it was discovered that request validation was lacking in Canna\nserver versions 3.6 and\
  \ earlier. A malicious remote user could exploit this\nvulnerability to leak information or\
  \ cause a denial of service attack. \n(CAN-2002-1159)\n\nRed Hat Linux Advanced Server ships\
  \ with a Canna package vulnerable\nto these issues; however, the package is normally only\
  \ installed when\nJapanese language support is selected during installation.\n\nAll users\
  \ of Canna are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a backported security\
  \ fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank hsj and AIDA Shinra\
  \ for the responsible\ndisclosure of these issues."
