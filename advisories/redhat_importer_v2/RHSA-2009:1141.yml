  - CVE-2009-2288
summary: |
  Updated nagios packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  the Red Hat HPC Solution.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Nagios is a program that can monitor hosts and services on your network. It
  can send email or page alerts when problems arise and when problems are
  resolved.

  A shell command injection flaw was discovered in the statuswml.cgi CGI
  script used by Nagios. A remote attacker able to access Nagios web pages
  could use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
  web server user (apache). (CVE-2009-2288)

  Note: Successful authentication is required to access Nagios web pages. In
  the Red Hat HPC Solution, configuration for Nagios is provided by the
  kusu-nagios-config package, which creates a user with a fixed, default
  password during installation. It is recommended to change this default
  password, or restrict access to Nagios web pages based on a client's IP
  address as is appropriate for your environment.

  Users of nagios should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
