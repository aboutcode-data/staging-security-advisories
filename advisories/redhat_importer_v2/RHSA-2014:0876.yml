  - CVE-2014-3482
summary: |
  Updated ruby193-rubygem-activerecord packages that fix one security issue
  are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Ruby on Rails is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web
  application development. Active Record implements object-relational mapping
  for accessing database entries using objects.

  It was discovered that Active Record did not properly quote values of the
  bitstring type attributes when using the PostgreSQL database adapter.
  A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to conduct an SQL injection
  attack against applications using Active Record. (CVE-2014-3482)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting this
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Sean Griffin of thoughtbot as the original
  reporter.

  All ruby193-rubygem-activerecord users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
