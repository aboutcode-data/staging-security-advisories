  - CVE-2017-6074
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation freed SKB (socket buffer) resources for a DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet when the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option is set on the socket. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to alter the kernel memory, allowing them to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-6074, Important)
