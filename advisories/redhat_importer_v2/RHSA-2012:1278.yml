summary: |
  Updated Grid component packages that fix several security issues, add
  various enhancements and fix multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
  IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
  performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
  enterprise customers.

  A number of unprotected resources (web pages, export functionality, image
  viewing) were found in Cumin. An unauthenticated user could bypass intended
  access restrictions, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2012-2680)

  Cumin could generate weak session keys, potentially allowing remote
  attackers to predict session keys and obtain unauthorized access to Cumin.
  (CVE-2012-2681)

  Multiple cross-site scripting flaws in Cumin could allow remote attackers
  to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.
  (CVE-2012-2683)

  An SQL injection flaw in Cumin could allow remote attackers to manipulate
  the contents of the back-end database via a specially-crafted URL.
  (CVE-2012-2684)

  When Cumin handled image requests, clients could request images of
  arbitrary sizes. This could result in large memory allocations on the Cumin
  server, leading to an out-of-memory condition. (CVE-2012-2685)

  Cumin did not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. If an
  attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the Cumin web interface,
  into visiting a specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized
  command execution in the Cumin web interface with the privileges of the
  logged-in user. (CVE-2012-2734)

  A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to
  pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use
  this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.
  (CVE-2012-2735)

  It was found that authenticated users could send a specially-crafted HTTP
  POST request to Cumin that would cause it to submit a job attribute change
  to Condor. This could be used to change internal Condor attributes,
  including the Owner attribute, which could allow Cumin users to elevate
  their privileges. (CVE-2012-3459)

  It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
  accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
  writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
  such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
  execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)

  It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
  the ClassAds format served by condor_startd. An unauthenticated user able
  to connect to condor_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
  job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
  could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
  job as well as start new jobs on the system. (CVE-2012-3493)

  It was discovered that the ability to abort a job in Condor only required
  WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and
  job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass
  intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system. (CVE-2012-3491)

  The above issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
  Security Team.

  This update also provides defense in depth patches for Condor. (BZ#848212,
  BZ#835592, BZ#841173, BZ#843476)

  These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 provide numerous
  enhancements and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some highlights
  include:

  * Integration with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager via Deltacloud
  * Role enforcement in Cumin
  * Cumin authentication integration with LDAP
  * Enhanced Red Hat HA integration managing multiple-schedulers nodes
  * Generic local resource limits for partitionable slots
  * Concurrency limit groups

  Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
  the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, linked to in the
  References section, for information on these changes.
