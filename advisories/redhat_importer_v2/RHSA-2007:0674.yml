aliases:
  - CVE-2007-3377
  - CVE-2007-3409
summary: |
  Updated perl-Net-DNS packages that correct two security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules that act as a Domain Name System
  (DNS) resolver.

  A flaw was found in the way Net::DNS generated the ID field in a DNS query.
  This predictable ID field could be used by a remote attacker to return
  invalid DNS data. (CVE-2007-3377)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Net::DNS parsed certain DNS
  requests. A malformed response to a DNS request could cause the application
  using Net::DNS to crash or stop responding. (CVE-2007-3409)

  Users of Net::DNS should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
