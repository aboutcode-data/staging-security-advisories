  - CVE-2010-0727
summary: |
  Updated GFS packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 3.9, kernel release 2.4.21-63.EL.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Red Hat Global File System (GFS) allows a cluster of Linux servers to
  share data in a common pool of storage.

  A flaw was found in the gfs_lock() implementation. The GFS locking code
  could skip the lock operation for files that have the S_ISGID bit
  (set-group-ID on execution) in their mode set. A local, unprivileged user
  on a system that has a GFS file system mounted could use this flaw to cause
  a kernel panic. (CVE-2010-0727)

  As well, these updated GFS packages are in sync with the latest kernel
  (2.4.21-63.EL). The modules in earlier GFS packages fail to load because
  they do not match the running kernel. It is possible to force-load the
  modules; however, with this update, force-loading the modules is not
  required. (BZ#525198)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these latest GFS packages, which resolve
  this issue and are updated for use with the 2.4.21-63.EL kernel.
