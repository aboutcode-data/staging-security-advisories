  - CVE-2014-8602
summary: "Updated unbound packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are\nnow available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having\
  \ Low security\nimpact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives\
  \ a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n\
  \nThe unbound packages provide a validating, recursive, and caching DNS or\nDNSSEC resolver.\n\
  \nA denial of service flaw was found in unbound that an attacker could use to\ntrick the unbound\
  \ resolver into following an endless loop of delegations,\nconsuming an excessive amount of\
  \ resources. (CVE-2014-8602)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this\
  \ update, there was a mistake in the time configuration in\nthe cron job invoking unbound-anchor\
  \ to update the root zone key.\nConsequently, unbound-anchor was invoked once a month instead\
  \ of every day,\nthus not complying with RFC 5011. The cron job has been replaced with a\n\
  systemd timer unit that is invoked on a daily basis. Now, the root zone key\nvalidity is checked\
  \ daily at a random time within a 24-hour window, and\ncompliance with RFC 5011 is ensured.\
  \ (BZ#1180267)\n\n* Previously, the unbound packages were installing their configuration file\n\
  for the systemd-tmpfiles utility into the /etc/tmpfiles.d/ directory. As a \nconsequence,\
  \ changes to unbound made by the administrator in \n/etc/tmpfiles.d/ could be overwritten\
  \ on package reinstallation or update. \nTo fix this bug, unbound has been amended to install\
  \ the configuration file\ninto the /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ directory. As a result, the system\
  \ \nadministrator's configuration in /etc/tmpfiles.d/ is preserved, including \nany changes,\
  \ on package reinstallation or update. (BZ#1180995)\n\n* The unbound server default configuration\
  \ included validation of DNS\nrecords using the DNSSEC Look-aside Validation (DLV) registry.\
  \ The Internet\nSystems Consortium (ISC) plans to deprecate the DLV registry service as no\n\
  longer needed, and unbound could execute unnecessary steps. Therefore, the \nuse of the DLV\
  \ registry has been removed from the unbound server default \nconfiguration. Now, unbound\
  \ does not try to perform DNS records validation \nusing the DLV registry. (BZ#1223339)\n\n\
  All unbound users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported\
  \ patches to correct these issues."
