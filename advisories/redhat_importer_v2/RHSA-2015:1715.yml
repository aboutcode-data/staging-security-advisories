  - CVE-2015-3247
summary: |
  An updated spice-server package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
  remote display protocol for virtual environments. SPICE users can access a
  virtualized desktop or server from the local system or any system with
  network access to the server. SPICE is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
  viewing virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine
  (KVM) hypervisor or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisors.

  A race condition flaw, leading to a heap-based memory corruption, was found
  in spice's worker_update_monitors_config() function, which runs under the
  QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could leverage this flaw to
  crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process. (CVE-2015-3247)

  This issue was discovered by Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat.

  All spice-server users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
