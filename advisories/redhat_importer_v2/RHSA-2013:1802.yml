  - CVE-2013-6367
summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue and one
  bug is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  Upgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may
  appear with the status of "Install Failed". If this happens, place the host
  into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an
  "Up" state.

  A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the apic_get_tmcct() function in KVM's
  Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC) implementation.
  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
  (CVE-2013-6367)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting this
  issue.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2013-2141, CVE-2013-4470, and CVE-2013-6368 (kernel issues)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The NVR of the rhev-hypervisor6 rpm and the contents of
  /etc/system-release did not match. This caused the hypervisor to show an
  error message "A new version is available; an upgrade option will appear
  once the Host is moved to maintenance mode." and suggested an update, even
  though the hypervisor was up to date. The version information in the rpm
  NVR and /etc/system-release now match. Now, the hypervisor only suggests
  updating when there is an update available. (BZ#1034817)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
