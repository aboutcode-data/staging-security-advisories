  - CVE-2016-4985
summary: |
  An update for openstack-ironic is now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security
  impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenStack Bare Metal (ironic) is a tool used to provision bare metal (as
  opposed to virtual) machines. It leverages common technologies such as PXE
  boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware. It also supports pluggable
  drivers to allow added, vendor-specific functionality.

  Security Fix(es):

  * An authentication vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic. A client with network access to the ironic-api service could bypass OpenStack Identity authentication, and retrieve all information about any node registered with OpenStack Bare Metal. If an unprivileged attacker knew (or was able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to a node, the flaw could be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the node's /v1/drivers/$DRIVER_NAME/vendor_passthru resource. The response included the node's full details, including management passwords, even if the /etc/ironic/policy.json file was configured to hide passwords in API responses. (CVE-2016-4985)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Ironic project for reporting
  this issue. Upstream acknowledges Devananda van der Veen (IBM) as the
  original reporter.
