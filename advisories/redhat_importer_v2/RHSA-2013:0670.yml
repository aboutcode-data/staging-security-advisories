summary: |
  Updated Django packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Django web framework is used by Horizon, the OpenStack Dashboard, which
  is a web interface for managing OpenStack services.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
  parser used by Django. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
  specially-crafted request to an Horizon API, causing Horizon to consume an
  excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2013-1664)

  A flaw was found in the XML parser used by Django. If a remote attacker
  sent a specially-crafted request to an Horizon API, it could cause Horizon
  to connect to external entities, causing a large amount of system load, or
  allow an attacker to read files on the Horizon server that are accessible
  to the user running Horizon. (CVE-2013-1665)

  It was found that the history view in the bundled administrative web
  interface in Django did not perform permission checks. An authenticated
  user who can access the web interface could use this flaw to view the
  changes to objects and data they would otherwise not have access to.
  (CVE-2013-0305)

  A flaw was found in the way Django handled formsets. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to submit a large number of forms, causing excessive
  memory consumption. Note: The current version of OpenStack in Red Hat
  OpenStack Folsom does not expose this vulnerability. (CVE-2013-0306)

  This update also includes two hardening fixes to help protect against XML
  entity and HTTP Host header poisoning attacks. (BZ#913039, BZ#913037)

  All users of Horizon are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which resolve these issues. After installing the updated packages, the
  httpd daemon must be restarted ("service httpd restart") for the update to
  take effect.
