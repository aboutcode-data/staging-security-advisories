  Updated ruby193-ruby packages that fix three security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the

  Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language.
  It has features to process text files and to perform system management
  tasks.

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the Ruby REXML XML
  parser performed expansion of parameter entities. A specially crafted XML
  document could cause REXML to use an excessive amount of CPU and memory.
  (CVE-2014-8080, CVE-2014-8090)

  A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the implementation of the Ruby
  Array pack() method. When performing base64 encoding, a single byte could
  be written past the end of the buffer, possibly causing Ruby to crash.
  (CVE-2014-4975)

  The CVE-2014-8090 issue was discovered by Red Hat Product Security.

  All ruby193-ruby users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  instances of Ruby need to be restarted for this update to take effect.
