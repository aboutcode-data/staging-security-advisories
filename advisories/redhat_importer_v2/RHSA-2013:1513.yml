  - CVE-2013-4480
summary: |
  An updated rhn-java-sat package that fixes a security issue is now available for Red Hat Network Satellite 5.2.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Network Satellite is a systems management tool for Linux-based infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, monitoring, and remote management of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool. The rhn-java-sat packages contain the code for the Java version of the Red Hat Network Satellite Web site.

  It was found that the web interface provided by Red Hat Network Satellite to create the initial administrator user was not disabled after the initial user was created. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create an administrator user with credentials they specify. This user could then be used to assume control of the Satellite server. (CVE-2013-4480)

  This issue was discovered by Andrew Spurrier of Red Hat.

  All rhn-java-sat users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.
