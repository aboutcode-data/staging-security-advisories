summary: |
  Updated XFree86 packages that fix a libXpm integer overflow flaw and a
  number of bugs are now available.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  XFree86 is an open source implementation of the X Window System.  It
  provides the basic low level functionality which full-fledged graphical
  user interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in libXpm, which is used by some
  applications for loading of XPM images.  An attacker could create a
  malicious XPM file that would execute arbitrary code if opened by a victim
  using an application linked to the vulnerable library.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2005-0605 to this issue.

  XFree86 4.1.0 was not functional on systems that did not have a legacy
  keyboard controller (8042).  During startup, the X server would attempt to
  update registers on the 8042 controller, but if that chip was not present,
  the X server would hang during startup.  This new release has a workaround
  so that the access to those registers time out if they are not present.

  A bug in libXaw could cause applications to segfault on 64-bit systems
  under certain circumstances.  This has been fixed with a patch backported
  from XFree86 4.3.0.

  Xlib contained a memory leak caused by double allocation, which has been
  fixed in XFree86 4.3.0 using backported patch.

  All users of XFree86 should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve these issues.
