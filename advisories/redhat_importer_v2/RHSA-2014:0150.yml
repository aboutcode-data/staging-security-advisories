  - CVE-2012-2673
summary: |
  Updated gc packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Satellite Proxy 5.6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Red Hat Satellite Proxy provides a package-caching mechanism that reduces
  the bandwidth requirements for Red Hat Satellite and enables custom package
  deployment. Red Hat Satellite Proxy customers are able to cache RPM
  packages, such as are provided by Errata Updates from Red Hat, or custom
  RPM packages generated by their organization, on an internal,
  centrally-located server.

  gc is a Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector for C and C++.

  It was discovered that gc's implementation of the malloc() and calloc()
  routines did not properly perform parameter sanitization when allocating
  memory. If an application using gc did not implement application-level
  validity checks for the malloc() and calloc() routines, a remote attacker
  could provide specially crafted application-specific input, which, when
  processed by the application, could lead to an application crash or,
  potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
  running the application. (CVE-2012-2673)

  Users of Red Hat Network Proxy 5.6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For this
  update to take effect, Red Hat Network Proxy must be restarted. Refer to
  the Solution section for details.
