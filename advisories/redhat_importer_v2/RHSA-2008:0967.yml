  - CVE-2008-2364
  - CVE-2008-2939
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that resolve several security issues and fix a bug
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

  A flaw was found in the mod_proxy Apache module. An attacker in control of
  a Web server to which requests were being proxied could have caused a
  limited denial of service due to CPU consumption and stack exhaustion.
  (CVE-2008-2364)

  A flaw was found in the mod_proxy_ftp Apache module. If Apache was
  configured to support FTP-over-HTTP proxying, a remote attacker could have
  performed a cross-site scripting attack. (CVE-2008-2939)

  In addition, these updated packages fix a bug found in the handling of the
  "ProxyRemoteMatch" directive in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 httpd
  packages. This bug is not present in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 5 packages.

  Users of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
