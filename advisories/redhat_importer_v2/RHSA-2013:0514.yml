summary: |
  Updated php packages that fix three security issues, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
  HTTP Server.

  It was found that PHP did not check for carriage returns in HTTP headers,
  allowing intended HTTP response splitting protections to be bypassed.
  Depending on the web browser the victim is using, a remote attacker could
  use this flaw to perform HTTP response splitting attacks. (CVE-2011-1398)

  An integer signedness issue, leading to a heap-based buffer underflow, was
  found in the PHP scandir() function. If a remote attacker could upload an
  excessively large number of files to a directory the scandir() function
  runs on, it could cause the PHP interpreter to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2688)

  It was found that PHP did not correctly handle the magic_quotes_gpc
  configuration directive. This could result in magic_quotes_gpc input
  escaping not being applied in all cases, possibly making it easier for a
  remote attacker to perform SQL injection attacks. (CVE-2012-0831)

  These updated php packages also include numerous bug fixes and
  enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
  of these changes.

  All users of php are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  fix these issues and add these enhancements. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
