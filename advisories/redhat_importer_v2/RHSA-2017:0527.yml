  - CVE-2016-8745
summary: "An update for tomcat6 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common\
  \ Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating,\
  \ is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n\
  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies.\n\
  \nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line\
  \ permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that\
  \ also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data\
  \ into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache,\
  \ perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own.\
  \ (CVE-2016-6816)\n\nNote: This fix causes Tomcat to respond with an HTTP 400 Bad Request\
  \ error when request contains characters that are not permitted by the HTTP specification\
  \ to appear not encoded, even though they were previously accepted. The newly introduced system\
  \ property tomcat.util.http.parser.HttpParser.requestTargetAllow can be used to configure\
  \ Tomcat to accept curly braces ({ and }) and the pipe symbol (|) in not encoded form, as\
  \ these are often used in URLs without being properly encoded. \n\n* A bug was discovered\
  \ in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP connector. This led to the\
  \ current Processor object being added to the Processor cache multiple times allowing information\
  \ leakage between requests including, and not limited to, session ID and the response body.\
  \ (CVE-2016-8745)"
