  - CVE-2003-0252
summary: |
  Updated nfs-utils packages are available that fix a remotely exploitable
  Denial of Service vulnerability.

  The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
  related tools.

  Janusz Niewiadomski found a buffer overflow bug in nfs-utils version 1.0.3
  and earlier. This bug could be exploited by an attacker, causing a remote
  Denial of Service (crash). It is not believed that this bug could lead to
  remote arbitrary code execution.

  Users are advised to update to these erratum packages, which contain a
  backported security patch supplied by the nfs-utils maintainers and are not
  vulnerable to this issue.
