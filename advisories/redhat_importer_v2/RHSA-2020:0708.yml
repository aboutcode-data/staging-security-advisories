summary: |
  An update for http-parser is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The http-parser package provides a utility for parsing HTTP messages. It parses both requests and responses. The parser is designed to be used in performance HTTP applications. It does not make any system calls or allocations, it does not buffer data, and it can be interrupted at any time. Depending on your architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data per message stream.

  Security Fix(es):

  * nodejs: HTTP request smuggling using malformed Transfer-Encoding header (CVE-2019-15605)
