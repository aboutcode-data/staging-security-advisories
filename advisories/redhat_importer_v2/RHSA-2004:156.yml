summary: "An updated mailman package that closes a DoS vulnerability in mailman\nintroduced\
  \ by RHSA-2004:019 is now available.\n\nMailman is a mailing list manager.\n\nOn February\
  \ 19 2004, Red Hat issued security erratum RHSA-2004:019 to\ncorrect a DoS (Denial of Service)\
  \ vulnerability where an attacker could\nsend a carefully-crafted message and cause mailman\
  \ to crash. \n\nMatthew Saltzman discovered a flaw in our original patch intended to\ncorrect\
  \ this vulnerability.  This flaw can cause mailman to crash if it\nreceives an email destined\
  \ for a list with an empty subject field.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\
  \ (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0182 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Mailman\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ninclude an updated patch and are\
  \ not vulnerable to this issue."
