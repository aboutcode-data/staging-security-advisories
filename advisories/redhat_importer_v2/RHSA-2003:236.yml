summary: |
  This erratum provides updated KDE packages that resolve a security issue in
  Konquerer.

  KDE is a graphical desktop environment for the X Window System.
  Konqueror is the file manager for the K Desktop Environment.

  George Staikos reported that Konqueror may inadvertently send
  authentication credentials to websites other than the intended website in
  clear text via the HTTP-referer header.  This can occur when authentication
  credentials are passed as part of a URL in the form http://user:password@host/

  Users of Konqueror are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
  contain a backported security patch correcting this issue.
