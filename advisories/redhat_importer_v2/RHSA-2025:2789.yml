summary: "Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.5.0 has been released\n\nRelease of Red Hat OpenShift\
  \ distributed tracing provides following security improvements, bug fixes, and new features.\n\
  Breaking changes:\n* Nothing\n\nDeprecations:\n* In the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.5,\
  \ the Loki Exporter, which is a temporary Technology Preview feature, is deprecated. The Loki\
  \ Exporter is planned to be removed in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.6. If you currently\
  \ use the Loki Exporter for the OpenShift Logging 6.1 or later, replace the Loki Exporter\
  \ with the OTLP HTTP Exporter.\n\nTechnology Preview features:\n* AWS CloudWatch Exporter\n\
  * AWS EMF Exporter\n* AWS X-Ray Exporter\n\nEnhancements:\n* The following Technology Preview\
  \ features reach General Availability:\n\n  * Host Metrics Receiver\n\n  * Kubelet Stats Receiver\n\
  \n* With this update, the OpenTelemetry Collector uses the OTLP HTTP Exporter to push logs\
  \ to the OpenShift Logging (LokiStack) 6.1 or later.\n* With this update, the Operator automatically\
  \ creates RBAC rules for the Kubernetes Events Receiver (k8sevents), Kubernetes Cluster Receiver\
  \ (k8scluster), and Kubernetes Objects Receiver (k8sobjects) if the Operator has sufficient\
  \ permissions.\n  For more information, see \"Creating the required RBAC resources automatically\"\

  \n\nBug fixes:\n* Before this update, manually created routes for the Collector services were\
  \ unintentionally removed when the Operator pod was restarted. With this update, restarting\
  \ the Operator pod does not result in the removal of the manually created routes.        \n\
  Known issues:\n* Nothing"
