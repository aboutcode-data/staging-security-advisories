summary: "An updated squirrelmail package that fixes multiple security issues is now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important\
  \ security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSquirrelMail is a standards-based\
  \ webmail package written in PHP.\n\nA server-side code injection flaw was found in the SquirrelMail\n\
  \"map_yp_alias\" function. If SquirrelMail was configured to retrieve a\nuser's IMAP server\
  \ address from a Network Information Service (NIS) server\nvia the \"map_yp_alias\" function,\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker using\na specially-crafted username could use this flaw\
  \ to execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the web server. (CVE-2009-1579)\n\nMultiple\
  \ cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. An\nattacker could construct\
  \ a carefully crafted URL, which once visited by an \nunsuspecting user, could cause the user's\
  \ web browser to execute malicious\nscript in the context of the visited SquirrelMail web\
  \ page. (CVE-2009-1578)\n\nIt was discovered that SquirrelMail did not properly sanitize Cascading\n\
  Style Sheets (CSS) directives used in HTML mail. A remote attacker could\nsend a specially-crafted\
  \ email that could place mail content above\nSquirrelMail's controls, possibly allowing phishing\
  \ and cross-site\nscripting attacks. (CVE-2009-1581)\n\nUsers of squirrelmail should upgrade\
  \ to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues."
