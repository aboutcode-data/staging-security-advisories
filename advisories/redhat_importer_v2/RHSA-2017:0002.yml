summary: |
  An update for rh-nodejs4-nodejs and rh-nodejs4-http-parser is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

  The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: rh-nodejs4-nodejs (4.6.2), rh-nodejs4-http-parser (2.7.0). (BZ#1388097)

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that Node.js' tls.checkServerIdentity() function did not properly validate server certificates containing wildcards. A malicious TLS server could use this flaw to get a specially crafted certificate accepted by a Node.js TLS client. (CVE-2016-7099)

  * It was found that the V8 Zone class was vulnerable to integer overflow when allocating new memory (Zone::New() and Zone::NewExpand()). An attacker with the ability to manipulate a large zone could crash the application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the application privileges. (CVE-2016-1669)

  * A vulnerability was found in c-ares, a DNS resolver library bundled with Node.js. A hostname with an escaped trailing dot would have its size calculated incorrectly, leading to a single byte written beyond the end of a buffer on the heap. An attacker able to provide such a hostname to an application using c-ares, could potentially cause that application to crash. (CVE-2016-5180)

  * It was found that the reason argument in ServerResponse#writeHead() was not properly validated. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack via a specially-crafted HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5325)
