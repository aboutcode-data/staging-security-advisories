  - CVE-2014-9322
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled GS segment register
  base switching when recovering from a #SS (stack segment) fault on an
  erroneous return to user space. A local, unprivileged user could use this
  flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-9322, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andy Lutomirski for reporting this issue.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
