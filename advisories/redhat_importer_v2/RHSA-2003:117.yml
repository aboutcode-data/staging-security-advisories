summary: "Updated versions of Stronghold 3.0 that fix two OpenSSL vulnerabilities are\nnow available.\n\
  \nStronghold 3 contains a number of open source technologies including\nOpenSSL.  Two issues\
  \ in OpenSSL have recently been discovered:\n\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured,\
  \ and open source toolkit that\nimplements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport\
  \ Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols.  It also implements a full-strength general \npurpose\
  \ cryptography library.\n\nResearchers have discovered a timing attack on RSA keys. Applications\n\
  making use of OpenSSL are generally vulnerable to such an attack, unless\nRSA blinding has\
  \ been turned on. OpenSSL does not use RSA blinding by\ndefault and most applications do not\
  \ enable RSA blinding. \n\nA local or remote attacker could use this attack to obtain the\
  \ server's\nprivate key.  This could be done by determining factors using timing\ndifferences\
  \ on:\n\n(1) The number of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction\n\n(2) The use of\
  \ different integer multiplication algorithms (\"Karatsuba\" and\nnormal)\n\nIn order for\
  \ an attack to be successful, an attacker must have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small\
  \ changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\n\nAdditionally, the SSL and TLS components\
  \ for OpenSSL allow remote attackers\nto perform an unauthorized RSA private key operation\
  \ via a modified\nBleichenbacher attack. This attack uses a large number of SSL or TLS\nconnections,\
  \ using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, and causes OpenSSL to leak\ninformation regarding the relationship\
  \ between ciphertext and the\nassociated plaintext.  This is also known as the \"Klima-Pokorny-Rosa\
  \ attack.\"\n\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL group that\n\
  enables RSA blinding by default and protects against\nKlima-Pokorny-Rosa attacks."
