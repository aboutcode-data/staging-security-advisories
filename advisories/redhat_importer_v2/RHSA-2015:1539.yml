summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2, which fixes three security issues, several
  bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system
  for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of
  JBoss rules and BPMN2-compliant business processes.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2 serves as a replacement for
  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements,
  which are documented in the README.txt file included with the patch files.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that Apache Camel's XML converter performed XML External
  Entity (XXE) expansion. A remote attacker able to submit an SAXSource
  containing an XXE declaration could use this flaw to read files accessible
  to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other
  more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0263)

  It was found that Apache Camel performed XML External Entity (XXE)
  expansion when evaluating invalid XML Strings or invalid XML GenericFile
  objects. A remote attacker able to submit a crafted XML message could use
  this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application
  server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.
  (CVE-2015-0264)

  A flaw was found in the dashbuilder import facility: the DocumentBuilders
  instantiated in org.jboss.dashboard.export.ImportManagerImpl did not
  disable external entities. This could allow an attacker to perform a
  variety of XML External Entity (XXE) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  attacks. (CVE-2015-1818)

  Red Hat would like to thank David Jorm of IIX Product Security for
  reporting the CVE-2015-1818 issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.2.
