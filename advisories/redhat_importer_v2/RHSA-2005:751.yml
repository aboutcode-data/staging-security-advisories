summary: "Updated openldap and nss_ldap packages that correct a potential password \ndisclosure\
  \ issue are now available.\n \nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact\
  \ by the Red \nHat Security Response Team.\n\nOpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight\
  \ Directory Access\nProtocol) applications and development tools.\n\nThe nss_ldap module is\
  \ an extension for use with GNU libc which allows\napplications to, without internal modification,\
  \ consult a directory service\nusing LDAP to supplement information that would be read from\
  \ local files\nsuch as /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow.\n\nA bug was found in the\
  \ way OpenLDAP, nss_ldap, and pam_ldap refer LDAP\nservers. If a client connection is referred\
  \ to a different server, it is\npossible that the referred connection will not be encrypted\
  \ even if the\nclient has \"ssl start_tls\" in its ldap.conf file. The Common\nVulnerabilities\
  \ and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-2069\nto this issue.\n\nA bug was also\
  \ found in the way certain OpenLDAP authentication schemes\nstore hashed passwords. A remote\
  \ attacker could re-use a hashed password to\ngain access to unauthorized resources. The Common\
  \ Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CAN-2004-0823 to this issue.\n\
  \nAll users of OpenLDAP and nss_ldap are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which\
  \ contain backported fixes that resolve these issues."
