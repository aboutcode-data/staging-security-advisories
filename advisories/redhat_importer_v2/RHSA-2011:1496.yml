  - CVE-2011-4313
summary: |
  Updated bind packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
  Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
  library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
  tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

  A flaw was discovered in the way BIND handled certain DNS queries, which
  caused it to cache an invalid record. A remote attacker could use this
  flaw to send repeated queries for this invalid record, causing the
  resolvers to exit unexpectedly due to a failed assertion. (CVE-2011-4313)

  Users of bind are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  resolve this issue. After installing the update, the BIND daemon (named)
  will be restarted automatically.
