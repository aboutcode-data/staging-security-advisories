summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  Multiple checksum validation flaws were discovered in the MIT Kerberos
  implementation. A remote attacker could use these flaws to tamper with
  certain Kerberos protocol packets and, possibly, bypass authentication or
  authorization mechanisms and escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-1323,
  CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020)

  Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos Team for reporting these
  issues.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * When attempting to perform PKINIT pre-authentication, if the client had
  more than one possible candidate certificate the client could fail to
  select the certificate and key to use. This usually occurred if certificate
  selection was configured to use the value of the keyUsage extension, or if
  any of the candidate certificates did not contain a subjectAltName
  extension. Consequently, the client attempted to perform pre-authentication
  using a different (usually password-based) mechanism. (BZ#644825)

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the krb5kdc daemon will be restarted automatically.
