  - CVE-2007-1860
summary: |
  Updated mod_jk packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Application Server.

  This update has been rated as having Important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  mod_jk is a Tomcat connector that can be used to communicate between Tomcat
  and the Apache HTTP Server 2.

  Versions of mod_jk before 1.2.23 decoded request URLs by default inside
  Apache httpd and forwarded the encoded URL to Tomcat, which itself did a
  second decoding.  If Tomcat was used behind mod_jk and configured to only
  proxy some contexts, an attacker could construct a carefully crafted HTTP
  request to work around the context restriction and potentially access
  non-proxied content (CVE-2007-1860).

  Users of mod_jk should upgrade to these updated packages, which address
  this issue by changing the default so mod_jk forwards the original
  unchanged request URL to Tomcat.
