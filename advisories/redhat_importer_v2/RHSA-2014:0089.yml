  - CVE-2013-6391
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and several
  bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack Identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  It was found that the ec2token API in keystone, which is used to generate
  EC2-style (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) credentials, could generate a
  token not scoped to a particular trust when creating a token from a
  received trust-scoped token. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  retrieve a token that elevated their privileges to all of the trustor's
  roles. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups that have EC2-style
  authentication enabled were affected. (CVE-2013-6391)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
  reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as the
  original reporter.

  These updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.2.1,
  which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  (BZ#1045408)

  All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
