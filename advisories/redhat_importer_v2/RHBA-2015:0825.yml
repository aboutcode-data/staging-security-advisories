summary: |
  Updated  packages that resolve various issues are now available for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 7.

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform provides the facilities for
  building a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud
  running on commonly available physical hardware.

  This update addresses the following issues:

  * Previously, when swift client added a 'Content-Length' header and
  requests implicitly added a 'content-length' header, requests sends both
  as separate headers. This caused Apache to reject the request with a
  400 error.
  With this release, python-requests package is now rebased to version 2.3.0.
  This version fixes the buggy implementation of case-insensitive mapping.
  As a result, Apache no longer rejects requests with a 400
  error. (BZ#1169530)

  * Previously, the log directory permissions for Sahara was set to 755,
  resulting in the Sahara service not conforming to the Red Hat log security
  standards.
  With this update, the directory permissions are modified to 750, thus,
  conforming to the Red Hat log security standards. (BZ#1163420)

  * Previously, SELinux prevented the nova scheduler from searching
  directories labeled 'cert_t', resulting in SELinux causing Compute to fail.
  With this update, an 'allow' rule has been created to give the nova
  scheduler permission to search the 'cert_t' directories. As a result,
  Compute service functions normally. (BZ#1149975)

  * Previously, the 'nova list' was inefficient and took very long to
  complete as the number of instances increased.
  With this update, 'nova list' command code has been optimized and uses
  server-side filtering, resulting in faster response. (BZ#1147958)

  * If an existing haproxy process was already running before installing and
  running LBaaS (Load-Balancing-as-a-Service), attempting to start LBaaS will
  fail. This typically happens when upgrading to Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  OpenStack Platform 5 with an existing LBaaS service.
  To work around this, you will have to kill the running haproxy process and
  restart the LBaaS agent:
  # kill $(pgrep haproxy)
  # service neutron-lbaas-agent restart (BZ#1133920)

  * Previously, the rabbitmq-plugins command was not available in the
  default path. As a result, trying to run rabbitmq-plugins command would
  result in a 'Command Not Found' error.
  With this update, the rabbitmq-plugins command is added to the default
  path and it executes as expected. (BZ#1126680)

  * Previously, an improvement to the connection pool such that new
  connections could be made concurrently made it so that the 'init on first
  connect' routine of a SQLAlchemy dialect would not have been completed if
  concurrent routines proceeded at the same time. As a result, when a
  SQLAlchemy engine was first used, operations which rely on the state
  acquired during initial startup could fail, as this information would not
  have been completed.
  To resolve this issue, with this update, 'mutexing' was added to the event
  system which handles the initial dialect startup phase, so that connection
  attempts are again serialized, but only when the engine first start
  up. (BZ#1121796)

  * Previously, SQLite database was created by a user who ran the database
  management script, resulting in Sahara being unable to read the default
  database without changing ownership of the database.
  With this update, the file is not touched and the ownership is assigned to
  Sahara (for only the default file location). As a result, Sahara now has
  access to its database in the default flow. (BZ#1101516)

  * With this release, mariadb-galera is now rebased to version 5.5.41 fixing
  the memory barrier problem in InnoDB/XtraDB mutex implementation causing
  the server to stall or hang. (BZ#1168321)

  In addition to the above issue, this update also addresses bugs and
  enhancements which can be found in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
