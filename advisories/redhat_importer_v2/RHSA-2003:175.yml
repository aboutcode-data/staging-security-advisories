aliases:
  - CVE-2003-0255
summary: |
  Updated gnupg packages correcting a bug in the GnuPG key validation
  functions are now available.

  The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a utility for encrypting data and
  creating digital signatures.

  When evaluating trust values for different UIDs assigned to a given key,
  GnuPG versions earlier than 1.2.2 would incorrectly associate the trust
  value of the UID with the highest trust value with every UID assigned to
  that key.  This would prevent an expected warning message from being generated.

  All users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which include
  patches from the GnuPG development team that correct this issue for GnuPG
  versions 1.0.7 and 1.2.1. This update also upgrades Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2,
  and 7.3 users to GnuPG version 1.0.7.
