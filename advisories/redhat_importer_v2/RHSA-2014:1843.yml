summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM
  subsystem handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user
  who has access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.
  (CVE-2014-3611, Important)

  * A memory corruption flaw was found in the way the USB ConnectTech
  WhiteHEAT serial driver processed completion commands sent via USB Request
  Blocks buffers. An attacker with physical access to the system could use
  this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on
  the system. (CVE-2014-3185, Moderate)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM
  exits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT)
  and invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On hosts
  with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit support, an unprivileged
  guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-3645,
  CVE-2014-3646, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google for reporting
  CVE-2014-3611, and the Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security for
  reporting CVE-2014-3645 and CVE-2014-3646.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * This update fixes several race conditions between PCI error recovery
  callbacks and potential calls of the ifup and ifdown commands in the tg3
  driver. When triggered, these race conditions could cause a kernel crash.
  (BZ#1142570)

  * Previously, GFS2 failed to unmount a sub-mounted GFS2 file system if its
  parent was also a GFS2 file system. This problem has been fixed by adding
  the appropriate d_op->d_hash() routine call for the last component of the
  mount point path in the path name lookup mechanism code (namei).
  (BZ#1145193)

  * Due to previous changes in the virtio-net driver, a Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.6 guest was unable to boot with the "mgr_rxbuf=off" option
  specified. This was caused by providing the page_to_skb() function with an
  incorrect packet length in the driver's Rx path. This problem has been
  fixed and the guest in the described scenario can now boot successfully.
  (BZ#1148693)

  * When using one of the newer IPSec Authentication Header (AH) algorithms
  with Openswan, a kernel panic could occur. This happened because the
  maximum truncated ICV length was too small. To fix this problem, the
  MAX_AH_AUTH_LEN parameter has been set to 64. (BZ#1149083)

  * A bug in the IPMI driver caused the kernel to panic when an IPMI
  interface was removed using the hotmod script. The IPMI driver has been
  fixed to properly clean the relevant data when removing an IPMI interface.
  (BZ#1149578)

  * Due to a bug in the IPMI driver, the kernel could panic when adding an
  IPMI interface that was previously removed using the hotmod script.
  This update fixes this bug by ensuring that the relevant shadow structure
  is initialized at the right time. (BZ#1149580)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
