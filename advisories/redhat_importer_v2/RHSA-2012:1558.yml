  - CVE-2012-4573
summary: "Updated openstack-glance packages that fix multiple bugs and add various enhancements\
  \ are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Essex.\n\nThe openstack-glance packages allows virtual\
  \ machine images to be discovered, registered and retrieved. It also includes a RESTful API\
  \ to provide these services to other applications.\n\nThe openstack-glance packages have been\
  \ upgraded to upstream version 2012.1.2, which provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements\
  \ over the previous version.\n\nA flaw in Keystone allowed an attacker with access to the\
  \ web and network  \ninterfaces to delete arbitrary, non-protected images from Glance servers.\
  \ \n(CVE-2012-4573) \n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this\n\
  issue. Upstream acknowledges Gabe Westmaas as the original reporter of\nCVE-2012-4573.\n\n\
  All users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix\
  \ these bugs and add these enhancements. After installing the updated packages, the Glance\
  \ services (openstack-glance-api and openstack-glance-registry) will be restarted automatically."
