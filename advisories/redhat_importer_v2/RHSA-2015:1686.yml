  - CVE-2015-5143
summary: |
  Updated python-django packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
  development and a clean, pragmatic design. It focuses on automating as much
  as possible and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

  A flaw was found in the Django session backend, which could allow an
  unauthenticated attacker to create session records in the configured
  session store, causing a denial of service by filling up the session store.
  (CVE-2015-5143)

  Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Django project for reporting
  this issue.

  All python-django users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
