summary: "Updated libxml2 packages that fix an overflow when parsing remote resources\nare now\
  \ available.\n\n[Updated 3 March 2004]\nRevised libxml2 packages are now available as the\
  \ original packages did not\ncontain a complete patch.\n\nlibxml2 is a library for manipulating\
  \ XML files.\n\nYuuichi Teranishi discovered a flaw in libxml2 versions prior to 2.6.6. \n\
  When fetching a remote resource via FTP or HTTP, libxml2 uses special\nparsing routines. \
  \ These routines can overflow a buffer if passed a very\nlong URL.  If an attacker is able\
  \ to find an application using libxml2 that\nparses remote resources and allows them to influence\
  \ the URL, then this\nflaw could be used to execute arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities\n\
  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0110\nto this issue.\n\
  \nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported\
  \ fix and are not vulnerable to this issue."
