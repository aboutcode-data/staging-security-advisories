  - CVE-2014-3801
summary: |
  Updated openstack-heat packages that fix one security issue, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify
  and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking.
  It can also be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn
  allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and
  applications. Orchestration can also be integrated with Telemetry alarms to
  implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.

  It was discovered that a user could temporarily be able to see the URL of a
  provider template used in another tenant. If the template itself could be
  accessed, then additional information could be leaked that would otherwise
  not be visible. (CVE-2014-3801)

  The openstack-heat packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. The most notable enhancements are:

  * Added OS profiler support into Orchestration (heat).
  * Multiple environment files can now be specified on the command line.
  * The command 'resource-list' now displays 'physical_resource_id'.
  (BZ#1146092)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, Qpid would attempt to reconnect to a broken message
  broker, even though multiple hosts were configured. With this update,
  reconnect() selects the next broker in the list for each connection
  attempt. (BZ#1082672)

  * Prior to this update, certain Qpid exceptions were not properly handled
  by the Qpid driver. As a result, the Qpid connection would fail and stop
  processing subsequent messages. With this update, all possible exceptions
  are handled to ensure the Qpid driver does not enter an unrecoverable
  failure loop. Consequently, Orchestration (heat) will continue to process
  Qpid messages, even after a major exception occur. (BZ#1085996)

  * The Qpid driver's v2 topology has been introduced to specifically address
  the slow growth of orphaned direct exchanges over time. By default,
  however, services still used the original v1 topology of the Qpid driver.
  The v2 topology had to be explicitly configured via the
  'qpid_topology_version = 2' parameter. With this fix, the Orchestration
  service's distribution configuration file (/usr/share/heat/heat-dist.conf)
  now contains the 'qpid_topology_version = 2' parameter. This effectively
  sets the Qpid driver's v2 topology as the default. In addition, the default
  value in the Qpid implementation has been changed to 2 as well.
  (BZ#1124137)

  * Previously, the version of Orchestration (heat) in Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux OpenStack Platform 4 did not include the "host_routes" property of
  the OS::Neutron::Subnet resource that was added in later releases of
  Orchestration. This change adds support for this property, which allows
  host routes to be specified for a subnet. (BZ#1095752)

  All openstack-heat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
