summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse and A-MQ 6.1.0 Patch 3 on Rollup Patch 1 (R1P3), which
  fixes two security issues and one bug, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
  flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.
  Red Hat JBoss A-MQ, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
  messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

  This patch is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ
  6.1.0. It includes a bug fix, which is documented in the readme.txt file
  included with the patch files. The following security issues are addressed
  in this release:

  It was found that if a configured LDAP server supported the unauthenticated
  authentication mechanism (as described by RFC 4513), the LDAPLoginModule
  implementation, provided by ActiveMQ Java Authentication and Authorization
  Service (JAAS), would consider an authentication attempt to be successful
  for a valid user that provided an empty password. A remote attacker could
  use this flaw to bypass the authentication mechanism of an application
  using LDAPLoginModule, and assume a role of any valid user within
  that application. (CVE-2014-3612)

  It was discovered that Apache ActiveMQ performed XML External Entity (XXE)
  expansion when evaluating XPath expressions. A remote, attacker-controlled
  consumer able to specify an XPath-based selector to dequeue XML messages
  from an Apache ActiveMQ broker could use this flaw to read files accessible
  to the user running the broker, and potentially perform other more advanced
  XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3600)

  Red Hat would like to thank Georgi Geshev of MWR Labs for reporting these
  issues.

  Refer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for
  installation instructions.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as
  provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this
  security update.
