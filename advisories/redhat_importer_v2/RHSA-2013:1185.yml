summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 patch 2, which fixes several security issues and
  various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides an
  integration platform.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 patch 2 is an update to Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0
  and includes bug fixes. Refer to the readme file included with the patch
  files for information about these fixes.

  The following security issues are also resolved with this update:

  A flaw was found in the logging performed during deserialization of the
  BrokerFactory class in Apache OpenJPA. A remote attacker able to supply a
  serialized instance of the BrokerFactory class, which will be deserialized
  on a server, could use this flaw to write an executable file to the
  server's file system. (CVE-2013-1768)

  A flaw in JRuby's JSON gem allowed remote attacks by creating different
  types of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of
  service attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
  create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It could
  also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
  injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

  It was discovered that JRuby's REXML library did not properly restrict XML
  entity expansion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service by tricking a Ruby application using REXML to read text nodes from
  specially-crafted XML content, which will result in REXML consuming large
  amounts of system memory. (CVE-2013-1821)

  Note: Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 ships JRuby as part of the camel-ruby
  component, which allows users to define Camel routes in Ruby. The default
  use of JRuby in Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 does not appear to expose either
  CVE-2013-0269 or CVE-2013-1821. If the version of JRuby shipped with Red
  Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 was used to build a custom application, then these
  flaws could be exposed.

  Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the Apache CXF StAX
  parser implementation processed certain XML files. If a web service
  utilized the StAX parser, a remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to excessive
  CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2013-2160)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting
  CVE-2013-0269, and Andreas Falkenberg of SEC Consult Deutschland GmbH, and
  Christian Mainka, Juraj Somorovsky and Joerg Schwenk of Ruhr-University
  Bochum for reporting CVE-2013-2160. Upstream acknowledges Thomas Hollstegge
  of Zweitag and Ben Murphy as the original reporters of CVE-2013-0269.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to apply this patch.
