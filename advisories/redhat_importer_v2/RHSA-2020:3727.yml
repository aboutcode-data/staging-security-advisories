aliases:
  - CVE-2020-10743
  - CVE-2020-14040
summary: |
  An update for logging-kibana5-container and openshift-enterprise-registry-container is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  OpenShift Container Platform components are primarily written in Go
  (golang). The golang.org/x/text contains text-related packages which are used for
  text operations, such as character encodings, text transformations, and
  locale-specific text handling.

  Kibana is one of the major components of OpenShift Container Platform
  cluster logging. It is a browser-based console interface to query, discover, and visualize
  the log data.

  Security Fix(es):

  * golang.org/x/text: possibility to trigger an infinite loop in encoding/unicode could lead to crash (CVE-2020-14040)

  * kibana: X-Frame-Option not set by default might lead to clickjacking (CVE-2020-10743)
