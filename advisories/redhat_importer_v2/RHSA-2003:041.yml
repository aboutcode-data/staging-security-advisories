summary: |
  Updated VNC packages are available, fixing a challenge replay and a weak
  cookie vulnerability.

  [Updated 10 July 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems.

  VNC is a tool for providing a remote graphical user interface.  Two
  vulnerabilities have been found in versions of VNC shipped by Red Hat.

  The VNC server acts as an X server, but the script for starting it
  generates an MIT X cookie (which is used for X authentication) without
  using a sufficiently strong random number generator.  This could allow an
  attacker to more easily guess the authentication cookie.

  The VNC DES authentication scheme is implemented using a challenge-response
  architecture, producing a random and different challenge for each
  authentication attempt. A bug in the function for generating the random
  challenge caused the random seed to be reset to the current time on every
  authentication attempt. Therefore, two authentication attempts within the
  same second could receive the same challenge.  An eavesdropper could
  exploit this vulnerability by replaying the response, thereby gaining
  authentication.

  All users of VNC are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which
  contain patches to correct these issues.

  Note that when using VNC on an untrusted network, always make sure to
  tunnel it through a secure authenticated protocol such as SSH.
