summary: "Updated mariadb-galera, rabbitmq-server, openvswitch, openstack-selinux, openstack-trove,\
  \ sos-plugins-openstack, and python-eventlet packages that resolve various issues are now\
  \ available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.\n\n\
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform provides the facilities for\nbuilding a private\
  \ or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud\nrunning on commonly available physical\
  \ hardware.\n\nThis update addresses the following issues:\n\n* Previously, a call to the\
  \ \"sed\" command within mysqld_safe.sh which was used to certain command line arguments failed\
  \ to accommodate arguments which included a slash, such as the paths to the SSL key and certificate\
  \ files to pass through this function. As a consequence, the mysqld_safe.sh script produced\
  \ warnings of the form \"unknown option to `s'\".  The script continued to work correctly\
  \ otherwise as these arguments are not actually needed in this specific context. With this\
  \ update, the call to sed has been corrected such that the SSL arguments which include slashes\
  \ are properly interpreted. As a result, the warnings regarding sed are now resolved. (BZ#1134032)\n\
  \n* Prior to this update, SELinux was preventing neutron from using the file system. As a\
  \ consequence, neutron failed to run. Now, an appropriate rule has been added to SELinux,\
  \ which allows neutron to run with SELinux in enforcing mode. (BZ#1176830)\n\n* With this\
  \ release, mariadb-galera is rebased to version 5.5.42, fixing an issue where \"duplicate\
  \ key\" errors would occur during INSERT statements, when performed during the period of time\
  \ when database connectivity was moving to another Galera node, and when the first Galera\
  \ node was entering a non-available state. (BZ#1240326)\n\n* Previously, the GM process would\
  \ send a message for all slaves to terminate once the master process terminated, but would\
  \ not wait for confirmation that the slaves had received this message before terminating itself.\
  \ As a result, a slave that did not receive the termination message would detect that the\
  \ master GM process had terminated, and would promote itself to master, causing the previous\
  \ master process to hang indefinitely. \nWith this update, the GM process now waits for its\
  \ broadcast buffer to empty before terminating. This results in all slaves receiving the message\
  \ to terminate, allowing the master process to terminate as expected. (BZ#1248081)\n\n* The\
  \ openvswitch packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.3.2, which provides a number\
  \ of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1250220)\n\n* The openstack-trove packages have\
  \ been upgraded to upstream version 2014.1.5, which provides a number of bug fixes over the\
  \ previous version. (BZ#1254705)\n\n* The python-oslo-messaging packages have been upgraded\
  \ to upstream version 1.3.1, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.\
  \ (BZ#1257640)\n\n* Previously, there was a hot loop in the Send function if the connection\
  \ was lost. As a consequence, the process consumed 100% CPU and hung indefinitely. To fix\
  \ this problem, an upstream patch for the greenio module has been added, which allows the\
  \ loop to exit if this condition happens. As a result, the process no longer consumes 100%\
  \ CPU in a hot loop, and it does not hang. (BZ#1259841)"
