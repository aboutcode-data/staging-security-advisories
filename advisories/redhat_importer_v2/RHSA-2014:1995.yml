summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 roll up patch 3, which fixes
  multiple security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works is the next-generation ESB and business
  process automation infrastructure.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Fuse
  Service Works 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in the
  README file included with the patch files.

  The following security issues are fixed with this release:

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  It was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML Java
  implementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity
  (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)

  It was found that Java Security Manager permissions configured via a policy
  file were not properly applied, causing all deployed applications to be
  granted the java.security.AllPermission permission. In certain cases, an
  attacker could use this flaw to circumvent expected security measures to
  perform actions which would otherwise be restricted. (CVE-2014-0093)

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
  custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
  native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
  HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  In Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, when running under a
  security manager, it was possible for deployed code to get access to the
  Modular Service Container (MSC) service registry without any permission
  checks. This could allow malicious deployments to modify the internal state
  of the server in various ways. (CVE-2014-0018)

  It was found that the security audit functionality logged request
  parameters in plain text. This may have caused passwords to be included in
  the audit log files when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local
  attacker with access to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to
  obtain application or server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)

  The CVE-2013-6440 issue was discovered by David Illsley, Ron Gutierrez of
  Gotham Digital Science, and David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security; the
  CVE-2014-0093 issue was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP
  Quality Engineering team; the CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian
  Weimer of Red Hat Product Security; and the CVE-2014-0018 issue was
  discovered by Stuart Douglas of Red Hat.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
