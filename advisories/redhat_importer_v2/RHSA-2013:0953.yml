summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Portal 5.2.2 roll up patch 1, which fixes multiple security
  issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Portal is the open source implementation of the Java EE suite
  of services and Portal services running atop Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform.

  JBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric
  keys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire
  plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)

  Spring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)
  expressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in
  the context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information
  from the server. (CVE-2011-2730)

  Note: Manual action is required to apply the fix for CVE-2011-2730. If your
  system has deployed applications which use Spring framework, the context
  parameter "springJspExpressionSupport" must be set to "false" to mitigate
  CVE-2011-2730, for example, in the application's web.xml file. This will
  prevent the double-evaluation of EL expressions that leads to the flaw.
  Red Hat JBoss Portal will deploy an application using Spring framework if
  JOSSO (Java Open Single Sign-On) is configured.

  XML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various
  frameworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use
  insecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled
  on endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as
  CVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be
  recovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue only affected
  the JBoss Web Services Native (jbossws-native) stack as Red Hat JBoss
  Portal does not use JBoss Web Services CXF (jbossws-cxf). (CVE-2012-5575)

  For jbossws-native, the fix for CVE-2012-5575 is implemented by two new
  configuration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element can be a
  child of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration
  descriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's
  jboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes
  are 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a
  blank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for
  the encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key
  wrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by
  default for empty lists or missing attributes.

  For example (do not include the line break in your configuration):

  encryption algorithms="aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm"
  keyWrapAlgorithms="rsa_oaep"

  Specifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the
  only permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and
  RSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.

  Before performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that
  each algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the
  allowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The
  algorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are
  the same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'
  element.

  Red Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum
  for reporting CVE-2011-2487, and Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj
  Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on
  Red Hat JBoss Portal, along with all customized configuration files, and
  any databases and database settings.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Portal 5.2.2 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
