summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix security vulnerabilities which may allow\nlocal users\
  \ to gain root privileges are now available.  These packages also\nresolve other minor issues.\n\
  \nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nPaul Starzetz discovered\
  \ a flaw in return value checking in mremap() in the\nLinux kernel versions 2.4.24 and previous\
  \ that may allow a local attacker\nto gain root privileges.  No exploit is currently available;\
  \ however this\nissue is exploitable. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2004-0077 to this issue.\n\nThe Vicam USB driver in kernel versions\
  \ prior to 2.4.25 does not use the\ncopy_from_user function to access userspace, which crosses\
  \ security\nboundaries.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2004-0075 to this issue.\n\nArjan van de Ven discovered a flaw\
  \ in ncp_lookup() in ncpfs that could\nallow local privilege escalation.  ncpfs is only used\
  \ to allow a system to\nmount volumes of NetWare servers or print to NetWare printers.  The\
  \ Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0010\
  \ to this issue.\n\nAlan Cox found issues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure that could\n\
  allow local privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2004-0003 to this issue.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to\
  \ these errata packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these issues.\
  \   \n\nRed Hat would like to thank Paul Starzetz from ISEC for reporting the issue\nCAN-2004-0077."
