summary: |
  Updated freetype packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
  manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
  efficiently.

  Multiple input validation flaws were found in the way FreeType processed
  bitmap font files. If a specially-crafted font file was loaded by an
  application linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the application. (CVE-2011-3256)

  Multiple input validation flaws were found in the way FreeType processed
  CID-keyed fonts. If a specially-crafted font file was loaded by an
  application linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running the application. (CVE-2011-3439)

  Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
  (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
