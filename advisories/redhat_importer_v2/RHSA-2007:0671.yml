  - CVE-2007-1353
summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and bugs in the\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 3 kernel are now available.\n\nThis security advisory has been rated as\
  \ having moderate security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThe Linux kernel\
  \ handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThese new kernel packages contain\
  \ fixes for the security issues described\nbelow:\n\n* a flaw in the ISDN CAPI subsystem that\
  \ allowed a remote user to cause a\ndenial of service or potential privilege escalation. (CVE-2007-1217,\
  \ Moderate)\n\n* a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to trigger an\n\
  information leak. (CVE-2007-1353, Low) \n\nIn addition to the security issues described above,\
  \ fixes for the following\nhave been included:\n\n* a race condition in the e1000 network\
  \ driver that could cause ESB2\nsystems to be started without the RX unit being turned on.\
  \ \n\n* a related e1000 bug on ESB2 systems that could cause rlogin to fail.\n\nRed Hat would\
  \ like to thank Ilja van Sprundel for reporting an issue fixed\nin this erratum. \n\nNote:\
  \ The kernel-unsupported package contains various drivers and modules\nthat are unsupported\
  \ and therefore might contain security problems that\nhave not been addressed.\n\nAll Red\
  \ Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated\
  \ with their machine architecture and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum."
