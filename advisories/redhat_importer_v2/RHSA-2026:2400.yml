  Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination\
  \ of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling,\
  \ with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression\
  \ methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression. \n\nSecurity\
