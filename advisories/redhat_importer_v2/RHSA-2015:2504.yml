  - CVE-2015-5302
summary: |
  Updated libreport packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  libreport provides an API for reporting different problems in applications
  to different bug targets, such as Bugzilla, FTP, and Trac. ABRT (Automatic
  Bug Reporting Tool) uses libreport.

  It was found that ABRT may have exposed unintended information to Red Hat
  Bugzilla during crash reporting. A bug in the libreport library caused
  changes made by a user in files included in a crash report to be discarded.
  As a result, Red Hat Bugzilla attachments may contain data that was not
  intended to be made public, including host names, IP addresses, or command
  line options. (CVE-2015-5302)

  This flaw did not affect default installations of ABRT on Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux as they do not post data to Red Hat Bugzilla. This feature
  can however be enabled, potentially impacting modified ABRT instances.

  As a precaution, Red Hat has identified bugs filed by such non-default Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux users of ABRT and marked them private.

  This issue was discovered by Bastien Nocera of Red Hat.

  All users of libreport are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which corrects this issue.
