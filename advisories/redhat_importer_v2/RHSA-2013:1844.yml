summary: |
  An update for the solr-core component of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit
  2.4.0 that fixes multiple security issues is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks
  into a single solution for Java applications. The Apache Solr component is
  an open-source search server based on the Lucene Java search library.

  It was found that the SolrResourceLoader class in Apache Solr allowed
  loading of resources via absolute paths, or relative paths which were not
  sanitized for directory traversal. Some Solr components expose REST
  interfaces which load resources (XSL style sheets and Velocity templates)
  via SolrResourceLoader, using paths identified by REST parameters. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to load arbitrary local files on the server
  via SolrResourceLoader, potentially resulting in information disclosure or
  remote code execution. (CVE-2013-6397)

  It was found that the XML and XSLT UpdateRequestHandler classes in Apache
  Solr would resolve external entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XML
  External Entity (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  read files accessible to the user running the application server, and
  potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2012-6612,
  CVE-2013-6407)

  It was found that the DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler class in Apache Solr
  would resolve external entities, allowing an attacker to conduct XXE
  attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to
  the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more
  advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6408)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.4.0 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
