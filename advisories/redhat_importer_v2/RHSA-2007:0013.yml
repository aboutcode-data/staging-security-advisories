aliases:
  - CVE-2006-2935
  - CVE-2006-4997
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix a number of security issues as well as
  other bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 (32 bit
  architectures)

  This security advisory has been rated as having moderate security impact by
  the Red Hat Security Response Team.

  The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

  These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues described
  below:

  * a flaw in the ATM subsystem affecting systems with installed ATM hardware
  and configured ATM support that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of
  service (panic) by accessing socket buffer memory after it has been freed
  (CVE-2006-4997, Moderate)

  * a flaw in the DVD handling of the CDROM driver that could be used
  together with a custom built USB device to gain root privileges
  (CVE-2006-2935, Moderate)

  In addition to the security issues described above, the following bugs are
  also addressed:

  * a potential overflow condition when reading /proc/devices
  * uninitialized memory in cdrom_init() that can lead to a crash at install time
  * a potential page corruption bug in /proc/kcore
  * a race condition when reading vmalloc()ed regions via /proc/kcore

  All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
  to these updated packages, which contain backported fixes to correct these
  issues.
