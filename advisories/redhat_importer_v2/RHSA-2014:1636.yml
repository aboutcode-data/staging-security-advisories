summary: |
  Updated java-1.8.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The java-1.8.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 8 Java Runtime
  Environment and the OpenJDK 8 Java Software Development Kit.

  It was discovered that the Libraries component in OpenJDK failed to
  properly handle ZIP archives that contain entries with a NUL byte used in
  the file names. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw
  to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2014-6562)

  Multiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components
  in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws
  to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2014-6506, CVE-2014-6531,
  CVE-2014-6502, CVE-2014-6511, CVE-2014-6504, CVE-2014-6519)

  It was discovered that the StAX XML parser in the JAXP component in OpenJDK
  performed expansion of external parameter entities even when external
  entity substitution was disabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
  perform XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attack against applications using the
  StAX parser to parse untrusted XML documents. (CVE-2014-6517)

  It was discovered that the Hotspot component in OpenJDK failed to properly
  handle malformed Shared Archive files. A local attacker able to modify a
  Shared Archive file used by a virtual machine of a different user could
  possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-6468)

  It was discovered that the DatagramSocket implementation in OpenJDK failed
  to perform source address checks for packets received on a connected
  socket. A remote attacker could use this flaw to have their packets
  processed as if they were received from the expected source.
  (CVE-2014-6512)

  It was discovered that the TLS/SSL implementation in the JSSE component in
  OpenJDK failed to properly verify the server identity during the
  renegotiation following session resumption, making it possible for
  malicious TLS/SSL servers to perform a Triple Handshake attack against
  clients using JSSE and client certificate authentication. (CVE-2014-6457)

  It was discovered that the CipherInputStream class implementation in
  OpenJDK did not properly handle certain exceptions. This could possibly
  allow an attacker to affect the integrity of an encrypted stream handled by
  this class. (CVE-2014-6558)

  The CVE-2014-6512 was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
  Security.

  All users of java-1.8.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
  must be restarted for the update to take effect.
