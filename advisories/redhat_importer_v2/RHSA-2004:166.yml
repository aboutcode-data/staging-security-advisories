summary: "Updated kernel packages that fix several minor security vulnerabilities are\nnow available\n\
  \nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\niDefense reported\
  \ a buffer overflow flaw in the ISO9660 filesystem code. \nAn attacker could create a malicious\
  \ filesystem in such a way that they\ncould gain root privileges if that filesystem is mounted.\
  \  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\n\
  CAN-2004-0109 to this issue.\n\nSolar Designer from OpenWall discovered a minor information\
  \ leak in the\next3 filesystem code due to the lack of initialization of journal\ndescriptor\
  \ blocks.  This flaw has only minor security implications and\nexploitation requires privileged\
  \ access to the raw device.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0177 to this issue.\n\nThese packages also contain an updated\
  \ fix with additional checks for\nissues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure.  The Common\n\
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0003\
  \ to this issue.\n\nAdditionally, hardening of the mremap function was applied to\nprevent\
  \ a potential local denial of service attack.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these\
  \ errata packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these issues."
