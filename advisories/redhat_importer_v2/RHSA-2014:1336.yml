  - CVE-2014-3594
summary: |
  Updated python-django-horizon packages that fix one security issue and
  several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
  Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
  interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
  The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
  size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
  to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

  A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the horizon host
  aggregate interface. A user with sufficient privileges to add a host
  aggregate could potentially use this flaw to capture the credentials of
  another user. (CVE-2014-3594)

  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich from the Horst
  Görtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum as the original
  reporters.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the "Create an Image" page rendering was blocked
  during a file upload. This could cause the browser to disconnect after a
  certain period of time, especially when uploading large files. With this
  update, the upload is handled in a separate thread, and large image uploads
  started via the web dashboard are less likely to time out and fail.
  (BZ#1089672)

  * Creating a user using keystoneclient could fail because keystoneclient
  attempted to create a role for the new user when setting up the user.
  When a role already existed, this operation failed and a new user was not
  created. This update fixes this bug, and user creation works as expected.
  (BZ#1094494)

  All python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
