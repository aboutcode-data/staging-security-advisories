  - CVE-2017-2616
summary: |
  An update for util-linux is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The util-linux packages contain a large variety of low-level system utilities that are necessary for a Linux system to function. Among others, these include the fdisk configuration tool and the login program.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A race condition was found in the way su handled the management of child processes. A local authenticated attacker could use this flaw to kill other processes with root privileges under specific conditions. (CVE-2017-2616)

  Red Hat would like to thank Tobias Stöckmann for reporting this issue.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * The "findmnt --target <path>" command prints all file systems where the mount point directory is <path>. Previously, when used in the chroot environment, "findmnt --target <path>" incorrectly displayed all mount points. The command has been fixed so that it now checks the mount point path and returns information only for the relevant mount point. (BZ#1414481)
