aliases:
  - CVE-2003-1023
summary: |
  Updated mc packages that resolve a buffer overflow vulnerability are now
  available.

  Midnight Commander is a visual shell much like a file manager.

  A buffer overflow has been found in Midnight Commander's virtual filesystem
  code. Specifically, a stack-based buffer overflow in vfs_s_resolve_symlink
  of vfs/direntry.c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code during
  symlink conversion.

  Users of Midnight Commander should install these updated packages, which
  resolve this issue.
