summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2011-3101, CVE-2012-1937, CVE-2012-1938, CVE-2012-1939,
  CVE-2012-1940, CVE-2012-1941, CVE-2012-1946, CVE-2012-1947)

  Note: CVE-2011-3101 only affected users of certain NVIDIA display drivers
  with graphics cards that have hardware acceleration enabled.

  It was found that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in
  Firefox no longer blocked Firefox inline event handlers. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to possibly bypass a web application's intended
  restrictions, if that application relied on CSP to protect against flaws
  such as cross-site scripting (XSS). (CVE-2012-1944)

  If a web server hosted HTML files that are stored on a Microsoft Windows
  share, or a Samba share, loading such files with Firefox could result in
  Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share also being loaded. An
  attacker could use this flaw to view the contents of local files and
  directories on the victim's system. This issue also affected users opening
  HTML files from Microsoft Windows shares, or Samba shares, that are mounted
  on their systems. (CVE-2012-1945)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 10.0.5 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.

  All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  Firefox version 10.0.5 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
  the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
