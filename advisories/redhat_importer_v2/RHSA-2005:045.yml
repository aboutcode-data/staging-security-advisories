  - CVE-2004-1189
summary: "Updated Kerberos (krb5) packages that correct a buffer overflow bug are now\navailable\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security\
  \ impact by the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team.\n\nKerberos is a networked authentication\
  \ system that uses a trusted third\nparty (a KDC) to authenticate clients and servers to each\
  \ other.\n\nA heap based buffer overflow bug was found in the administration library of\n\
  Kerberos 1.3.5 and earlier.  This bug could allow an authenticated remote\nattacker to execute\
  \ arbitrary commands on a realm's master Kerberos KDC. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
  \ project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-1189 to this issue.\n\nAll users\
  \ of krb5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches\
  \ to resolve these issues."
