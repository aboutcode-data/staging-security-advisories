summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix several security issues are now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nA number of buffer overflow flaws were found\
  \ in the PHP session extension,\nthe str_replace() function, and the imap_mail_compose() function.\n\
  If very long strings under the control of an attacker are passed to the\nstr_replace() function\
  \ then an integer overflow could occur in memory\nallocation.  If a script uses the imap_mail_compose()\
  \ function to create a\nnew MIME message based on an input body from an untrusted source,\
  \ it could\nresult in a heap overflow.  An attacker who is able to access a PHP\napplication\
  \ affected by any these issues could trigger these flaws and\npossibly execute arbitrary code\
  \ as the 'apache' user. (CVE-2007-0906)\n\nIf unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms,\
  \ the zend_hash_init()\nfunction can be forced to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources\n\
  for a limited length of time, until the script timeout alarm aborts\nexecution of the script.\
  \ (CVE-2007-0988)\n\nIf the wddx extension is used to import WDDX data from an untrusted source,\n\
  certain WDDX input packets may allow a random portion of heap memory to be\nexposed. (CVE-2007-0908)\n\
  \nIf the odbc_result_all() function is used to display data from a database,\nand the contents\
  \ of the database table are under the control of an\nattacker, a format string vulnerability\
  \ is possible which could lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary code.  (CVE-2007-0909)\n\nA\
  \ one byte memory read will always occur before the beginning of a buffer,\nwhich could be\
  \ triggered for example by any use of the header() function in\na script.  However it is unlikely\
  \ that this would have any effect.\n(CVE-2007-0907)\n\nSeveral flaws in PHP could allows attackers\
  \ to \"clobber\" certain\nsuper-global variables via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2007-0910)\n\
  \nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches\
  \ to correct these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Esser for his help diagnosing\
  \ these issues."
