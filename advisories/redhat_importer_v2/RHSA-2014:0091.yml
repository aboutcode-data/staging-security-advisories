  - CVE-2013-6419
summary: |
  Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue, several
  bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-neutron packages provide Openstack Networking (neutron), the
  virtual network service.

  It was discovered that the metadata agent in OpenStack Networking was
  missing an authorization check on the device ID that is bound to a specific
  port. A remote tenant could guess the instance ID bound to a port and
  retrieve metadata of another tenant, resulting in information disclosure.
  Note that only OpenStack Networking setups running neutron-metadata-agent
  were affected. (CVE-2013-6419)

  Red Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for
  reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Aaron Rosen of VMware as the
  original reporter.

  The openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. The most notable fixes and enhancements are:

  - Support for multiple workers in the Neutron API. This can be achieved by
    setting the 'workers=' parameter in the neutron.conf file.

  - The downtime and report interval default settings are tuned for
    neutron agents.

  - The floating IP address stability has been enhanced.

  - A heartbeat-related deadlock problem in neutron-server has been fixed.

  (BZ#1045419)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * An incorrect warning was displayed when running neutron-dhcp-agent with
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux's version of dnsmasq. This meant that users were
  incorrectly warned that Red Hat Enterprise Linux's dnsmasq version will not
  work with neutron-dhcp-agent. This warning has been removed, and will no
  longer be logged to the neutron-dhcp-agent log file. (BZ#1040196)

  * A bug in the QPID topic consumer re-connection logic (under the v2
  topology) caused qpidd to use a malformed subscriber address after
  restarting, resulting in RPC requests sent to a topic with multiple servers
  ending up being incorrectly multicast to all servers. This update removes
  the special-case reconnect logic that handles UUID addresses, which in turn
  avoids the incorrect establishment of multiple subscription to the same
  fanout address. The QPID broker now simply automatically generates unique
  queue names when clients reconnect. (BZ#1045067)

  * Thread-consuming QPID messages were killed silently by unhandled errors,
  thus resulting in isolating the component from the rest of the system.
  With this update, consuming threads are made more resilient to errors by
  ensuring they do not die on an unhandled error. The error is now logged,
  and the consuming thread is retried. (BZ#1054249)

  In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

  * Previously, instances connected to tenant networks gained outside
  connectivity by going through an SNAT by the L3 agent hosting that
  network's virtual router. With this release, the ability to disable
  SNAT/PAT on virtual servers is added ensuring that an instance in a tenant
  network subnet will retain its IP address as it passes through external
  networks. For example, if 10.0.0.1 is an instance in the 10.0.0.0/8 tenant
  network, R1, a virtual router that connects the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet to the
  20.0.0.0/8 public provider networks, then you can use the 'neutron
  router-gateway-set --disable-snat R1 public' command and any traffic from
  10.0.0.1, which is forwarded out to the provider network, will retain its
  actual source IP address of 10.0.0.1. This can be a flexible and useful
  method to connect instances directly to a provider network, while retaining
  it in a tenant network. (BZ#1046070)

  All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
