summary: "Updated PHP packages that fix several security issues are now available for\nRed Hat\
  \ Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nThis update has been rated as having important security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly\
  \ used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way\
  \ PHP processed a deeply nested\narray. A remote attacker could cause the PHP interpreter\
  \ to crash by\nsubmitting an input variable with a deeply nested array. (CVE-2007-1285)\n\n\
  A flaw was found in the way PHP's unserialize() function processes data. If\na remote attacker\
  \ is able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's unserialize()\nfunction, it may be possible for\
  \ them to execute arbitrary code as the\napache user. (CVE-2007-1286)\n\nA double free flaw\
  \ was found in PHP's session_decode() function. If a\nremote attacker is able to pass arbitrary\
  \ data to PHP's session_decode()\nfunction, it may be possible for them to execute arbitrary\
  \ code as the\napache user. (CVE-2007-1711)\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated\
  \ packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues."
