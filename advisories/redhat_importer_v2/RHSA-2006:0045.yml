  - CVE-2005-2917
summary: "Updated squid packages that fix a security vulnerability as well as\nseveral bugs\
  \ are now available.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the\
  \ Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nSquid is a high-performance proxy caching server for\
  \ Web clients,\nsupporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects.\n\nA denial of service flaw\
  \ was found in the way squid processes certain NTLM\nauthentication requests.  A remote attacker\
  \ could send a specially crafted\nNTLM authentication request which would cause the Squid\
  \ server to crash. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name\n\
  CVE-2005-2917 to this issue.\n\nSeveral bugs have also been addressed in this update:\n\n\
  * An error introduced in 2.5.STABLE3-6.3E.14 where Squid can crash if a\nuser visits a site\
  \ which has a long DNS record.\n\n* Some authentication helpers were missing needed setuid\
  \ rights.\n\n* Squid couldn't handle a reply from a HTTP server when the reply began\nwith\
  \ the new-line character or wasn't HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 compliant.\n\n* User-defined error\
  \ pages were not kept when the squid package was upgraded.\n\nAll users of squid should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues."
