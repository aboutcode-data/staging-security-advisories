  - CVE-2012-4431
summary: |
  Updated tomcat7 packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.0.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container.

  It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
  protected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  prevention filter. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
  CSRF attacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter
  and do not contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  Users of Tomcat should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
  this issue. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take effect.
