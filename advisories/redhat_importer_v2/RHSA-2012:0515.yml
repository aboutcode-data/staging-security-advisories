summary: |
  Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
  Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

  A flaw was found in Sanitiser for OpenType (OTS), used by Firefox to help
  prevent potential exploits in malformed OpenType fonts. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, under certain
  conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Firefox. (CVE-2011-3062)

  A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  Firefox. (CVE-2012-0467, CVE-2012-0468, CVE-2012-0469)

  A web page containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file
  could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0470)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox used its embedded Cairo library to
  render certain fonts. A web page containing malicious content could cause
  Firefox to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary
  code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0472)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox rendered certain images using WebGL. A
  web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
  under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-0478)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
  certain multibyte character sets. A web page containing malicious content
  could cause Firefox to run JavaScript code with the permissions of a
  different website. (CVE-2012-0471)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox rendered certain graphics using WebGL.
  A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash.
  (CVE-2012-0473)

  A flaw in Firefox allowed the address bar to display a different website
  than the one the user was visiting. An attacker could use this flaw to
  conceal a malicious URL, possibly tricking a user into believing they are
  viewing a trusted site, or allowing scripts to be loaded from the
  attacker's site, possibly leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  (CVE-2012-0474)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded the ISO-2022-KR and ISO-2022-CN
  character sets. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox
  to run JavaScript code with the permissions of a different website.
  (CVE-2012-0477)

  A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled RSS and Atom feeds. Invalid
  RSS or Atom content loaded over HTTPS caused Firefox to display the
  address of said content in the location bar, but not the content in the
  main window. The previous content continued to be displayed. An attacker
  could use this flaw to perform phishing attacks, or trick users into
  thinking they are visiting the site reported by the location bar, when the
  page is actually content controlled by an attacker. (CVE-2012-0479)

  For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories for Firefox 10.0.4 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
  advisories in the References section of this erratum.

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
