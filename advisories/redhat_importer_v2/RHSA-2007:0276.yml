  - CVE-2006-1174
summary: |
  Updated shadow-utils packages that fix a security issue and various bugs
  are now available.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  The shadow-utils package includes the necessary programs for converting
  UNIX password files to the shadow password format, as well as programs for
  managing user and group accounts.

  A flaw was found in the useradd tool in shadow-utils. A new user's
  mailbox, when created, could have random permissions for a short period.
  This could allow a local attacker to read or modify the mailbox.
  (CVE-2006-1174)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * shadow-utils debuginfo package was empty.

  * faillog was unusable on 64-bit systems. It checked every UID from 0 to
  the max UID, which was an excessively large number on 64-bit systems.

  * typo bug in login.defs file

  All users of shadow-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.
