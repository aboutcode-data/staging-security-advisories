  - CVE-2016-6662
summary: |
  An update for mariadb-galera is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  MariaDB is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server that is binary compatible with MySQL. Galera is a synchronous multi-master cluster for MariaDB.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was discovered that the MySQL logging functionality allowed writing to MySQL configuration files. An administrative database user, or a database user with FILE privileges, could possibly use this flaw to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system running the database server. (CVE-2016-6662)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 changed the return format of the "systemctl is-enabled" command as consumed by shell scripts, the mariadb-galera RPM package, upon installation, erroneously detected that the MariaDB service was enabled when it was not. As a result, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform installer, which then tried to run mariadb-galera using Pacemaker and not systemd, failed to start Galera. With this update, mariadb-galera's RPM installation scripts now use a different systemctl command, correctly detecting the default MariaDB as disabled, and the installer can succeed. (BZ#1376908)

  * Previously, both the mariadb-server and mariadb-galera-server packages shipped the client-facing libraries, dialog.so and mysql_clear_password.so. As a result, the mariadb-galera-server package would fail to install because of package conflicts. With this update, these libraries have been moved from mariadb-galera-server to mariadb-libs, and the mariadb-galera-server package installs successfully. (BZ#1376902)
