summary: |
  An updated HelixPlayer package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  HelixPlayer is a media player.

  Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the way
  HelixPlayer processed Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) files. An attacker
  could create a specially-crafted GIF file which would cause HelixPlayer to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-4242,
  CVE-2009-4245)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way HelixPlayer processed
  Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) files. An attacker
  could create a specially-crafted SMIL file which would cause HelixPlayer to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-4257)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way HelixPlayer handled the Real
  Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) SET_PARAMETER directive. A malicious RTSP
  server could use this flaw to crash HelixPlayer or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-4248)

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in the way HelixPlayer
  handled RuleBook structures in media files and RTSP streams.
  Specially-crafted input could cause HelixPlayer to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-4247, CVE-2010-0417)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way HelixPlayer performed URL
  un-escaping. A specially-crafted URL string could cause HelixPlayer to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0416)

  All HelixPlayer users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains backported patches to resolve these issues. All running
  instances of HelixPlayer must be restarted for this update to take effect.
