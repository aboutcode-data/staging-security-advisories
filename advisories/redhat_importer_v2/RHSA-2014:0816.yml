summary: "Updated cfme packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs, and\nadd one\
  \ enhancement are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response\
  \ Team has rated this update as having\nImportant security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring\
  \ System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\n\
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nRed Hat CloudForms Management\
  \ Engine delivers the insight, control, and\nautomation needed to address the challenges of\
  \ managing virtual\nenvironments. CloudForms Management Engine is built on Ruby on Rails,\
  \ a\nmodel-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.\nAction Pack implements\
  \ the controller and the view components.\n\nThe SSH utility script created a world-writable\
  \ file in /tmp/ using a\npredictable name, and then executed it as root. A local attacker\
  \ could use\nthis flaw to execute arbitrary commands as the root user. (CVE-2014-3486)\n\n\
  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled\nwildcard segments in\
  \ routes with implicit rendering. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to retrieve arbitrary\
  \ local files accessible to a Ruby\non Rails application using the aforementioned routes via\
  \ a specially\ncrafted request. (CVE-2014-0130)\n\nThe root password of newly-deployed systems\
  \ was logged to evm.log, allowing\nattackers with local user accounts on the CloudForms Management\
  \ Engine\nserver to gain root access to newly-deployed systems. (CVE-2014-0184)\n\nA reflected\
  \ cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way CloudForms\nManagement Engine escaped\
  \ JavaScript elements in certain views. An attacker\ncould construct a carefully crafted URL,\
  \ which once visited by an\nunsuspecting user, could cause the user's web browser to execute\
  \ a\nmalicious script in the context of the CloudForms Management Engine domain.\n(CVE-2014-0176)\n\
  \nIt was found that the wait_for_task() function of CloudForms Management\nEngine could, under\
  \ certain circumstances, enter an infinite loop. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to\
  \ repeatedly call wait_for_task(), which\nwould cause an excessive amount of CPU resources\
  \ to be consumed on the\nsystem running CloudForms Management Engine, resulting in a denial\
  \ of\nservice. (CVE-2014-0180)\n\nCloudForms Management Engine used a default salt value to\
  \ protect stored\npasswords; however, as the salt value was known, this did not provide\n\
  additional protection. This made it easier for local attackers with access\nto the stored\
  \ passwords to perform brute-force attacks and recover the\nplain text versions of the passwords.\
  \ (CVE-2014-3489)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0176 issue was discovered by Martin Povolny of Red Hat,\
  \ the \nCVE-2014-0180 issue was discovered by Jan Rusnacko of the Red Hat Product \nSecurity\
  \ Team and CVE-2014-3486 issue was discovered by Kurt Seifried of \nthe Red Hat Product Security\
  \ Team.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the dashboard\
  \ widget regeneration could fail with\nan error status for users who were members of multiple\
  \ LDAP groups.\nThe Widget.get_group method has been updated to work with both a group ID\n\
  and a description, and the timing out of active and queued miq_tasks has\nbeen fixed. Dashboard\
  \ widgets now regenerate correctly. (BZ#1089673)\n\n* When CloudForms Management Engine failed\
  \ to check the current region for\na user, the dashboard widgets would display no data for\
  \ that user.\nWith this update, region checking has been fixed and all widgets in the\ndashboard\
  \ display correctly. (BZ#1090577)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\
  \n* In order to read storage reports more easily, a new feature has been\nimplemented for\
  \ snapshot sizes to be available as suffixed bytes (B, KB,\nMB, GB), similar to other disk-related\
  \ columns (for example the total\nprovisioned space and disk capacity). (BZ#1089036)\n\nAll\
  \ users of Red Hat CloudForms 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which\
  \ correct these issues and add this enhancement."
