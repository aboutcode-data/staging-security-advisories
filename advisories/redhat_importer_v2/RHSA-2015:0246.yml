  - CVE-2014-9493
summary: |
  Updated openstack-glance packages that fix one security issue are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0 and Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
  and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and
  delivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to
  copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored
  images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly
  and more consistently than installing a server operating system and
  individually configuring additional services.

  It was discovered that an authenticated user could use a path traversal
  flaw in glance to download or delete any file on the glance server that is
  accessible to the glance process user. Note that only setups using the
  OpenStack Image V2 API were affected by this flaw. (CVE-2014-9493)

  All openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the running glance services will be restarted automatically.
