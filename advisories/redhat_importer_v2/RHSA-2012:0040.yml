  - CVE-2011-4608
summary: |
  An update for the Native components for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2
  that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  Part of the Native components for JBoss Enterprise Web Platform is
  mod_cluster, an Apache HTTP Server (httpd) based load balancer. Like
  mod_jk, it uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to
  an application server node.

  It was found that mod_cluster allowed worker nodes to register on any
  virtual host (vhost), regardless of the security constraints applied to
  other vhosts. In a typical environment, there will be one vhost configured
  internally for worker nodes, and another configured externally for serving
  content. A remote attacker could use this flaw to register an
  attacker-controlled worker node via an external vhost that is not
  configured to apply security constraints, then use that worker node to
  serve malicious content, intercept credentials, and hijack user sessions.
  (CVE-2011-4608)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.2 as provided from the Red
  Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. Refer to the Solution
  section for installation instructions.
