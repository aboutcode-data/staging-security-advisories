summary: "Updated thunderbird packages that fix several security bugs are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\n\nThis update has been rated as having critical security impact\
  \ by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nMozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and\
  \ newsgroup client.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Thunderbird\n\
  1.0 branch. This update deprecates the Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0 branch in\nRed Hat Enterprise\
  \ Linux 4 in favor of the supported Mozilla Thunderbird\n1.5 branch.\n\nThis update also resolves\
  \ a number of outstanding Thunderbird security issues:\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the\
  \ way Thunderbird processed certain\njavascript actions. A malicious mail message could execute\
  \ arbitrary\njavascript instructions with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing the page\n\
  to steal sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,\nCVE-2006-2784,\
  \ CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809)\n\nSeveral denial of service\
  \ flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed\ncertain mail messages. A malicious web\
  \ page could crash the browser or\npossibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.\n\
  (CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677,\nCVE-2006-3113, CVE-2006-3803,\
  \ CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird\
  \ processed certain\njavascript actions. A malicious mail message could conduct a cross-site\n\
  scripting attack or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by\nother domains).\
  \ (CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)\n\nA form file upload flaw was found in the way Thunderbird\
  \ handled javascript\ninput object mutation. A malicious mail message could upload an arbitrary\n\
  local file at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)\n\nA denial of\
  \ service flaw was found in the way Thunderbird called the\ncrypto.signText() javascript function.\
  \ A malicious mail message could crash\nthe browser if the victim had a client certificate\
  \ loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed Proxy AutoConfig\
  \ scripts.\nA malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript\ninstructions\
  \ with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing the page to steal\nsensitive information or\
  \ install client malware. (CVE-2006-3808)\n\nNote: Please note that JavaScript support is\
  \ disabled by default in\nThunderbird. The above issues are not exploitable with JavaScript\
  \ disabled. \n\nTwo flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed malformed inline\nvcard\
  \ attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing a\ncarefully crafted vcard it\
  \ was possible to execute arbitrary code as the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-2781,\
  \ CVE-2006-3804)\n\nA cross site scripting flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed\n\
  Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 mail messages. A malicious\nweb page could\
  \ execute a script within the browser that a web input\nsanitizer could miss due to a malformed\
  \ \"script\" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)\n\nTwo HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way\
  \ Thunderbird\nprocessed certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could\n\
  return specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy\nrestrictions.\
  \ (CVE-2006-2786)\n\nA double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method\
  \ was\ncalled. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible\nto crash\
  \ Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-2788)\n\nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update,\
  \ which contains\nThunderbird version 1.5.0.5 that corrects these issues."
