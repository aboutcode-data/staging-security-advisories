summary: |
  An updated jboss-ec2-eap package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6 running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute
  Cloud (EC2).

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  jboss-ec2-eap provides JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) scripts for
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform running on the Amazon Web
  Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

  It was found that the "/var/cache/jboss-ec2-eap/" directory had world
  readable permissions when using the EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Image) for
  JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  6. A local attacker could use this flaw to read potentially sensitive
  information from this directory, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  credentials. (CVE-2012-3427)

  Note: This flaw only affected the EC2 AMI for JBoss Enterprise Application
  Platform 5.1.2.

  This issue was discovered by Aleksandar Kostadinov of the Red Hat QE Team.

  Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform's "server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along with all
  other customized configuration files.

  Users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6 running on EC2 should upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects this issue. The JBoss server process must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
