  - CVE-2017-1000367
summary: |
  An update for sudo is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system administrators to provide certain users with the permission to execute privileged commands, which are used for system management purposes, without having to log in as root.

  Security Fix(es):

  * A flaw was found in the way sudo parsed tty information from the process status file in the proc filesystem. A local user with privileges to execute commands via sudo could use this flaw to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2017-1000367)

  Red Hat would like to thank Qualys Security for reporting this issue.
