  - CVE-2004-0494
summary: "Updated GNOME VFS packages that remove potential extfs-related\nvulnerabilities are\
  \ now available.\n\nGNOME VFS is the GNOME virtual file system. It provides a modular\narchitecture\
  \ and ships with several modules that implement support for file\nsystems, HTTP, FTP, and\
  \ others.  The extfs backends make it possible to\nimplement file systems for GNOME VFS using\
  \ scripts.\n\nFlaws have been found in several of the GNOME VFS extfs backend scripts. \n\
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux ships with vulnerable scripts, but they are not\nused by default.\
  \  An attacker who is able to influence a user to open a\nspecially-crafted URI using gnome-vfs\
  \ could perform actions as that user.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0494 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Linux\
  \ should upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich remove these unused scripts."
