summary: |
  This is the 1-Month notification for the retirement of Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.1 Extended Update Support (EUS).

  In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy,
  Extended Update Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 will be retired on
  May 31, 2013, and support will no longer be provided. Accordingly, Red Hat
  will no longer provide updated packages, including critical impact security
  patches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 EUS
  after that date. In addition, after May 31, 2013, technical support through
  Red Hat's Global Support Services will no longer be provided.

  Note: This notification applies only to those customers with subscriptions
  to the Extended Update Support (EUS) channels for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.1.

  We encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 6.1 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. As a
  benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active
  subscriptions to entitle any system on a currently supported Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6 release (6.2, 6.3, or 6.4, for which EUS is available).
