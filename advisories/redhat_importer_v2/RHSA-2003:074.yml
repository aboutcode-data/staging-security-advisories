  - CVE-2002-1337
summary: |
  Updated Sendmail packages are available to fix a vulnerability that
  may allow remote attackers to gain root privileges by sending a
  carefully crafted message.

  [Updated March 18 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS.

  Sendmail is a widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA) which is included
  in all Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions.

  During a code audit of Sendmail by ISS, a critical vulnerability was
  uncovered that affects unpatched versions of Sendmail prior to version
  8.12.8.  A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted email message
  which, when processed by sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be
  executed as root.

  We are advised that a proof-of-concept exploit is known to exist, but
  is not believed to be in the wild.

  Since this is a message-based vulnerability, MTAs other than Sendmail
  may pass on the carefully crafted message.  This means that unpatched
  versions of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if
  they do not accept external connections directly.

  All users are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain
  a backported patch to correct this vulnerability.

  Red Hat would like to thank Eric Allman for his assistance with this
  vulnerability.
