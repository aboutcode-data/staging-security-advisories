summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4 and 5.

  This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  JBoss Enterprise Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set
  of components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the
  industry's leading web server (Apache HTTP Server), the popular Apache
  Tomcat servlet container, as well as the mod_jk connector and the Tomcat
  Native library.

  This 1.0.1 release of JBoss Enterprise Web Server serves as a replacement
  to JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 GA. These updated packages include
  a number of bug fixes. For detailed component, installation, and bug fix
  information, refer to the JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 Release Notes,
  available shortly from the link in the References section of this erratum.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the Tomcat deployment process. An
  attacker could create a specially-crafted WAR file, which once deployed
  by a local, unsuspecting user, would lead to attacker-controlled content
  being deployed outside of the web root, into directories accessible to the
  Tomcat process. (CVE-2009-2693)

  A second directory traversal flaw was found in the Tomcat deployment
  process. WAR file names were not sanitized, which could allow an attacker
  to create a specially-crafted WAR file that could delete files in the
  Tomcat host's work directory. (CVE-2009-2902)

  A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure
  Sockets Layer) protocols handle session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle
  attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's
  session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force
  the server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the
  victim's credentials. (CVE-2009-3555)

  This update provides a mitigation for this flaw in the following
  components:

  tomcat5 and tomcat6: A new attribute, allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation, is
  available for the blocking IO (BIO) connector using JSSE, to enable or
  disable TLS session renegotiation. The default value is "false", meaning
  session renegotiation, both client- and server-initiated, is disabled by
  default.

  tomcat-native: Client-initiated renegotiation is now rejected by the native
  connector. Server-initiated renegotiation is still allowed.

  Refer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about
  the CVE-2009-3555 flaw: http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4 and 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.
