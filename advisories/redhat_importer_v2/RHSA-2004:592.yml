  - CVE-2004-0888
summary: |
  An updated xpdf package that fixes a number of integer overflow security
  flaws is now available.

  Xpdf is an X Window System based viewer for Portable Document Format
  (PDF) files.

  During a source code audit, Chris Evans and others discovered a number
  of integer overflow bugs that affected all versions of xpdf.  An
  attacker could construct a carefully crafted PDF file that could cause
  xpdf to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opened.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2004-0888 to this issue.

  Users of xpdf are advised to upgrade to this errata package, which contains
  a backported patch correcting these issues.
