summary: |
  Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
  Image File Format (TIFF) files.

  A heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the
  tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially
  crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute
  arbitrary code. (CVE-2013-1960, CVE-2013-4232)

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker
  could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could
  cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
  (CVE-2013-4231, CVE-2013-4243, CVE-2013-4244)

  A flaw was found in the way libtiff handled OJPEG-encoded TIFF images. An
  attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted TIFF file that
  would cause an application using libtiff to crash. (CVE-2010-2596)

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker
  could use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would
  cause tiff2pdf to crash. (CVE-2013-1961)

  Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NCI Agency for reporting
  CVE-2013-1960 and CVE-2013-1961. The CVE-2013-4243 issue was discovered by
  Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and the
  CVE-2013-4244 issue was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat
  Security Response Team.

  All libtiff users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  applications linked against libtiff must be restarted for this update to
  take effect.
