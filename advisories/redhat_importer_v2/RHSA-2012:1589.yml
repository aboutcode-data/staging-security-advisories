  - CVE-2012-2313
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and one bug are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issue:

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's dl2k driver, used by
  certain D-Link Gigabit Ethernet adapters, restricted IOCTLs. A local,
  unprivileged user could use this flaw to issue potentially harmful IOCTLs,
  which could cause Ethernet adapters using the dl2k driver to malfunction
  (for example, losing network connectivity). (CVE-2012-2313, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting this issue.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The kernel allows high priority real time tasks, such as tasks scheduled
  with the SCHED_FIFO policy, to be throttled. Previously, the CPU stop tasks
  were scheduled as high priority real time tasks and could be thus throttled
  accordingly. However, the replenishment timer, which is responsible for
  clearing a throttle flag on tasks, could be pending on the just disabled
  CPU. This could lead to the situation that the throttled tasks were never
  scheduled to run. Consequently, if any of such tasks was needed to complete
  the CPU disabling, the system became unresponsive. This update introduces a
  new scheduler class, which gives a task the highest possible system
  priority and such a task cannot be throttled. The stop-task scheduling
  class is now used for the CPU stop tasks, and the system shutdown completes
  as expected in the scenario described. (BZ#876077)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
