  - CVE-2003-0015
summary: |
  Updated cvs packages are now available for Red Hat Linux 6.2, 7, 7.1, 7.2,
  7.3, and 8.0.  These updates close a vulnerability which would permit
  arbitrary command execution on servers configured to allow anonymous
  read-only access.

  [Updated 16 April 2003]
  Added packages for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries and pSeries systems

  CVS is a version control system frequently used to manage source code
  repositories.  During an audit of the CVS sources, Stefan Esser
  discovered an exploitable double-free bug in the CVS server.

  On servers which are configured to allow anonymous read-only access, this
  bug could be used by anonymous users to gain write privileges.  Users with
  CVS write privileges can then use the Update-prog and Checkin-prog features
  to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

  All users of CVS are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which
  contain patches to correct the double-free bug.

  Our thanks go to Stefan Esser of e-matters for reporting this issue to us.
