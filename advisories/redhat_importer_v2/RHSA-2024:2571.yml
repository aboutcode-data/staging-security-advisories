summary: |
  An update for sssd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It also provides the Name Service Switch (NSS) and the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) interfaces toward the system, and a pluggable back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources.

  Security Fix(es):

  * sssd: Race condition during authorization leads to GPO policies functioning inconsistently (CVE-2023-3758)

  Bug Fix(es):

  * socket leak (JIRA:RHEL-22340)

  * Passkey cannot fall back to password (JIRA:RHEL-28161)

  * sssd: Race condition during authorization leads to GPO policies functioning inconsistently (JIRA:RHEL-27209)
