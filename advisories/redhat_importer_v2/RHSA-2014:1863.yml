summary: |
  Updated Subscription Asset Manager 1.4 packages that fix multiple security
  issues are now available.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager acts as a proxy for handling
  subscription information and software updates on client machines. Red Hat
  Subscription Asset Manager is built on Ruby on Rails, a
  model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.
  Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.

  A directory traversal flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled
  wildcard segments in routes with implicit rendering. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to retrieve arbitrary local files accessible to a Ruby
  on Rails application using the aforementioned routes via a specially
  crafted request. (CVE-2014-0130)

  A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails handled hashes in certain
  queries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of
  service (resource consumption) attack by sending specially crafted queries
  that would result in the creation of Ruby symbols, which were never garbage
  collected. (CVE-2013-1854)

  Two cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in Action Pack. A remote
  attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks against users of an
  application using Action Pack. (CVE-2013-1855, CVE-2013-1857)

  It was discovered that the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails
  could, under certain circumstances, return a fallback HTML string that
  contained user input. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
  perform a reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by providing a
  specially crafted input to an application using the aforementioned
  component. (CVE-2013-4491)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the header handling component of
  Action View. A remote attacker could send strings in specially crafted
  headers that would be cached indefinitely, which would result in all
  available system memory eventually being consumed. (CVE-2013-6414)

  It was found that the number_to_currency Action View helper did not
  properly escape the unit parameter. An attacker could use this flaw to
  perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an application that uses
  data submitted by a user in the unit parameter. (CVE-2013-6415)

  Red Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting these
  issues. Upstream acknowledges Ben Murphy as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-1854, Charlie Somerville as the original reporter of
  CVE-2013-1855, Alan Jenkins as the original reporter of CVE-2013-1857,
  Peter McLarnan as the original reporter of CVE-2013-4491, Toby Hsieh as the
  original reporter of CVE-2013-6414, and Ankit Gupta as the original
  reporter of CVE-2013-6415.

  All Subscription Asset Manager users are advised to upgrade to these
  updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
