  - CVE-2017-15265
summary: |
  An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Long Life.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

  Security Fix(es):

  * kernel: Use-after-free in snd_seq_ioctl_create_port() (CVE-2017-15265)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * Previously, on certain Intel 64 systems, the microcode contained a new model-specific register (MSR) that was not present in the older microcode running on CPUs that had not been updated yet. As a consequence, the system crashed due to a general protection fault on a CPU running the older microcode. This update fixes the bug by having the kernel use MSR access routines that handle the general protection fault. As a result, the system no longer crashes in the described scenario. (BZ#1652467)
