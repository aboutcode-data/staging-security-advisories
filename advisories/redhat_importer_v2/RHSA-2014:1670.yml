  - CVE-2014-3615
summary: |
  Updated qemu-kvm-rhev packages that fix one security issue and one bug are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
  Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the
  user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments
  managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

  An information leak flaw was found in the way QEMU's VGA emulator accessed
  frame buffer memory for high resolution displays. A privileged guest user
  could use this flaw to leak memory contents of the host to the guest by
  setting the display to use a high resolution in the guest. (CVE-2014-3615)

  This issue was discovered by Laszlo Ersek of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * This update fixes a bug that caused the relative path to a backing file
  image to be switched to an absolute path during a live merge
  (block-commit). (BZ#1122925)

  All users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After
  installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all
  virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take
  effect.
