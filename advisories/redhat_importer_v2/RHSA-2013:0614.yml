  - CVE-2013-0787
summary: |
  Updated xulrunner packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  XULRunner provides the XUL Runtime environment for applications using the
  Gecko layout engine.

  A flaw was found in the way XULRunner handled malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause an application linked against
  XULRunner (such as Mozilla Firefox) to crash or execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-0787)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
  Upstream acknowledges VUPEN Security via the TippingPoint Zero Day
  Initiative project as the original reporter.

  For technical details regarding this flaw, refer to the Mozilla security
  advisories. You can find a link to the Mozilla advisories in the References
  section of this erratum.

  All XULRunner users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  this issue. After installing the update, applications using XULRunner must
  be restarted for the changes to take effect.
