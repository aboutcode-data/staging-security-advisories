  - CVE-2011-3026
summary: |
  An updated thunderbird package that fixes one security issue is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images. An HTML mail message or remote
  content containing a specially-crafted PNG image could cause Thunderbird to
  crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
  running Thunderbird. (CVE-2011-3026)

  All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  corrects this issue. After installing the update, Thunderbird must be
  restarted for the changes to take effect.
