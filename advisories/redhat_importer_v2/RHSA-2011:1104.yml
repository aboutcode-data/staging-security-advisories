  - CVE-2011-2690
  - CVE-2011-2692
summary: |
  Updated libpng packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
  manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libpng processed certain PNG
  image files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PNG image that,
  when opened, could cause an application using libpng to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the application. (CVE-2011-2690)

  Note: The application behavior required to exploit CVE-2011-2690 is rarely
  used. No application shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux behaves this
  way, for example.

  An uninitialized memory read issue was found in the way libpng processed
  certain PNG images that use the Physical Scale (sCAL) extension. An
  attacker could create a specially-crafted PNG image that, when opened,
  could cause an application using libpng to crash. (CVE-2011-2692)

  Users of libpng should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. All running applications using
  libpng must be restarted for the update to take effect.
