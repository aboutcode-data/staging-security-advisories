summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix three security issues and
  several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
  Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The OpenStack Identity service (Keystone) authenticates and authorizes
  OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
  The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
  user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style
  logins.

  It was found that the MySQL token driver did not correctly store token
  expiration times, which prevented manual token revocation. Only OpenStack
  Identity setups configured to make use of revocation events were affected.
  (CVE-2014-5251)

  A flaw was found in keystone revocation events that resulted in the
  "issued_at" time being updated when a token created by the V2 API was
  processed by the V3 API. This could allow a user to evade token revocation.
  Only OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of revocation events
  and UUID tokens were affected. (CVE-2014-5252)

  It was discovered that domain-scoped tokens were not revoked when a domain
  was disabled. Only OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of
  revocation events were affected. (CVE-2014-5253)

  The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2014.1.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
  The most notable bug fixes are:

  * When a scoped token that was created from an unscoped token was revoked,
  the original token was revoked as well. This was because the scope was not
  included in the revocation event. By including the scope in the revocation
  event, only the scoped token is revoked.

  * If a domain or a project was renamed, the old name remained in the cache.
  As a result the old name could be used in some requests until the cache
  record expired. For example, the old domain name could still be used for
  authentication after renaming the domain. Cache entries are now properly
  invalidated for domain and project rename operations.

  * OpenStack Identity did not return the same status and headers for HEAD
  and GET requests, which does not follow the HTTP specification. This would
  lead to different status codes between running keystone-all versus running
  keystone in Apache httpd with mod_wsgi. The responses have been corrected
  to be consistent regardless of the webserver being used.

  * The migration operation that creates the region table did not explicitly
  set the character set to 'utf8'. Consequently, when the database's default
  character set was not set, the db_sync operation failed. The migration
  operation now detects this condition and corrects the database.

  Refer to https://launchpad.net/keystone/icehouse/2014.1.2 for more
  information on the bug fixes included in version 2014.1.2.1. (BZ#1127434)

  All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues.
