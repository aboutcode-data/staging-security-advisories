summary: |
  Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 roll up patch 4, which fixes three
  security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that
  provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources
  to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data
  spread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML
  files, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local
  database.

  This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data
  Virtualization 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in
  the README file included with the patch files.

  The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

  It was found that Odata4j permitted XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. If a
  REST endpoint was deployed, a remote attacker could submit a request
  containing an external XML entity that, when resolved, allowed that
  attacker to read files on the application server in the context of the user
  running that server. (CVE-2014-0171)

  The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
  in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no custom
  library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native
  libraries with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI
  writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

  It was found that the security audit functionality logged request
  parameters in plain text. This may have caused passwords to be included in
  the audit log files when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local
  attacker with access to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to
  obtain application or server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)

  The CVE-2014-0171 issue was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product
  Security; the CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red
  Hat Product Security.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.
