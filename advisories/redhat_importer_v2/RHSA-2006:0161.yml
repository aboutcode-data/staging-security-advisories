summary: |
  Red Hat Application Server Release 2 Update 1 is now available.

  This update contains an upgrade of several RHAPS components to newer
  releases, including JOnAS 4.6.3, Tomcat 5.5.12 and Struts 1.2.8.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Red Hat Application Server packages provide a J2EE Application Server and
  Web container as well as the underlying Java stack.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Tomcat displays
  directory listings. A remote attacker could cause Tomcat to consume large
  amounts of CPU resources by sending multiple requests for a directory
  containing a large number of files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project has assigned the name CVE-2005-3510 to this issue.
  This update contains a version of Apache Tomcat that will recover after
  the aforementioned attack. Users are also advised to disable directory
  listing for web directories that contain very large numbers of files.

  A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Struts displays error
  pages. It may be possible for an attacker to construct a specially crafted
  URL which could fool a victim into believing they are viewing a trusted
  site. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
  name CVE-2005-3745 to this issue. Please note that this issue does not
  affect Struts running on Tomcat or JOnAS, which is our supported usage of
  Struts.

  Additionally, this update replaces some other outdated packages with new
  versions. Several bug fixes and enhancements are included in these new
  versions.

  IMPORTANT: Before applying this update, read the detailed
  installation/upgrade instructions in the RELEASE_NOTES document.

  All users of Red Hat Application Server should upgrade to these updated
  packages, which contain packages that are not vulnerable to these issues.
