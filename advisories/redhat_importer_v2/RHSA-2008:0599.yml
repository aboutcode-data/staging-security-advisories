  - CVE-2008-2785
summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  [Updated 16th July 2008]
  The original set of packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 were missing
  the seamonkey-nss and seamonkey-nspr packages. This errata was updated to
  add these missing packages.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed certain
  web content. A malicious web site could cause SeaMonkey to crash or execute
  arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2008-2785)

  All seamonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to resolve this issue.
