aliases:
  - CVE-2018-7750
summary: |
  An update for python-paramiko is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The python-paramiko package provides a Python module that implements the SSH2 protocol for encrypted and authenticated connections to remote machines. Unlike SSL, the SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. The protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across an encrypted tunnel.

  Security Fix(es):

  * python-paramiko: Authentication bypass in transport.py (CVE-2018-7750)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

  Bug Fix(es):

  * python-paramiko has been using the python2-pyasn1 package, but did not depend on it. With new versions of python2-cryptography, python2-pyasn1 was not getting installed and this caused python-paramiko to malfunction. This bug was fixed by making python-paramiko depend on python2-pyasn1 explicitly. (BZ#1559133)
