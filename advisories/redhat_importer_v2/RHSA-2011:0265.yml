  - CVE-2008-6552
summary: |
  Updated ccs packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Cluster Suite 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The Cluster Configuration System provides the ability for nodes in a
  cluster to obtain information about the cluster and each other. ccs_tool is
  a program for making online updates to the cluster configuration file.

  An insecure temporary file use flaw was found in ccs_tool. A local attacker
  could use this flaw to conduct a symbolic link attack, allowing them to
  overwrite (with the output of ccs_tool) an arbitrary file writable by the
  victim running ccs_tool. (CVE-2008-6552)

  All ccs users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this
  issue.
