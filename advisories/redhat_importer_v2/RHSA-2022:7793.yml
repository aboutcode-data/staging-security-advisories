aliases:
  - CVE-2022-37434
summary: |
  An update for rsync is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The rsync utility enables the users to copy and synchronize files locally or across a network. Synchronization with rsync is fast because rsync only sends the differences in files over the network instead of sending whole files. The rsync utility is also used as a mirroring tool.

  Security Fix(es):

  * zlib: heap-based buffer over-read and overflow in inflate() in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field (CVE-2022-37434)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
