  - CVE-2015-3248
summary: |
  Updated openhpi packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing an
  implementation of the SA Forum's Hardware Platform Interface (HPI).
  HPI provides an abstracted interface to managing computer hardware,
  typically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource
  modeling, access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and
  inventory data associated with resources, abstracted System Event Log
  interfaces, hardware events and alerts, and a managed hotswap interface.

  It was found that the "/var/lib/openhpi" directory provided by OpenHPI used
  world-writeable and world-readable permissions. A local user could use this
  flaw to view, modify, and delete OpenHPI-related data, or even fill up the
  storage device hosting the /var/lib directory. (CVE-2015-3248)

  This issue was discovered by Marko Myllynen of Red Hat.

  The openhpi packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.4.0, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  (BZ#1127908)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Network timeouts were handled incorrectly in the openhpid daemon. As a
  consequence, network connections could fail when external plug-ins were
  used. With this update, handling of network socket timeouts has been
  improved in openhpid, and the described problem no longer occurs.
  (BZ#1208127)

  All openhpi users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues and add these enhancements.
