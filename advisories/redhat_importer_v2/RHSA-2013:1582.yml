  - CVE-2013-4238
summary: |
  Updated python packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and add
  one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
  language.

  A flaw was found in the way the Python SSL module handled X.509 certificate
  fields that contain a NULL byte. An attacker could potentially exploit this
  flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers. Note that
  to exploit this issue, an attacker would need to obtain a carefully crafted
  certificate signed by an authority that the client trusts. (CVE-2013-4238)

  These updated python packages include numerous bug fixes and one
  enhancement. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this
  advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Technical
  Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant
  of these changes.

  All users of python are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  fix these issues and add this enhancement.
