aliases:
  - CVE-2002-0363
  - CVE-2003-0354
summary: |
  Updated packages are available for GNU Ghostscript under the iSeries and
  pSeries architectures which fix various security vulnerabilities.

  Ghostscript is a program for displaying PostScript files or printing them
  to non-PostScript printers.

  An untrusted PostScript file can cause ghostscript to execute arbitrary
  commands due to insufficient checking. Since ghostscript is often used
  during the course of printing a document (and is run as user lp), all
  users should install the packages contained in this erratum.

  The problem was fixed in the 6.53 source release of GNU Ghostscript, and
  the fix has been backported and applied to the packages referenced by this
  advisory.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
  assigned the name CAN-2002-0363 to this issue.

  Please note that this vulnerability is different to the "local file read"
  issue corrected by our previous Ghostscript errata (RHSA-2001:112 and
  RHSA-2001:138)

  A flaw in unpatched versions of Ghostscript before 7.07 allows malicious
  postscript files to execute arbitrary commands even with -dSAFER enabled.
  Note that this vulnerability does not affect Ghostscript when the Red Hat
  -dPARANOIDSAFER option is used. Therefore, a malicious print job cannot be
  used to exploit this vulnerability under Red Hat Linux.

  Users of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.
