  The multicluster engine for Kubernetes 2.4.4 General Availability release images, which fix bugs and update container images.

  The multicluster engine for Kubernetes v2.4.4 images

  The multicluster engine for Kubernetes provides the foundational components
  that are necessary for the centralized management of multiple
  Kubernetes-based clusters across data centers, public clouds, and private
  clouds.

  You can use the engine to create new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
  clusters or to bring existing Kubernetes-based clusters under management by
  importing them. After the clusters are managed, you can use the APIs that
  are provided by the engine to distribute configuration based on placement
  policy.
