  - CVE-2008-0960
summary: |
  Updated ucd-snmp packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol used for
  network management.

  A flaw was found in the way ucd-snmp checked an SNMPv3 packet's Keyed-Hash
  Message Authentication Code (HMAC). An attacker could use this flaw to
  spoof an authenticated SNMPv3 packet. (CVE-2008-0960)

  All users of ucd-snmp should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to resolve this issue.
