  - CVE-2011-0285
summary: |
  Updated krb5 packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
  servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
  trusted third-party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

  An invalid free flaw was found in the password-changing capability of the
  MIT Kerberos administration daemon, kadmind. A remote, unauthenticated
  attacker could use this flaw to cause kadmind to abort via a
  specially-crafted request. (CVE-2011-0285)

  All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
  packages, the kadmind daemon will be restarted automatically.
