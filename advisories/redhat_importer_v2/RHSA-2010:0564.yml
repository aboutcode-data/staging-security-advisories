summary: |
  Updated jboss-seam2 packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  4 and 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  [Updated 28 July 2010]
  The CVE-2010-1871 description has been updated to reflect that an attacker
  does not need to be authenticated to exploit this issue. No changes have
  been made to the packages.

  The JBoss Seam Framework is an application framework for building web
  applications in Java.

  An input sanitization flaw was found in the way JBoss Seam processed
  certain parametrized JBoss Expression Language (EL) expressions. A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code via a URL,
  containing appended, specially-crafted expression language parameters,
  provided to certain applications based on the JBoss Seam framework. Note: A
  properly configured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent
  exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2010-1871)

  Red Hat would like to thank Meder Kydyraliev of the Google Security Team
  for responsibly reporting this issue.

  Users of jboss-seam2 should upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The JBoss server process
  must be restarted for this update to take effect.
