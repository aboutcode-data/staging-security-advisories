summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
  bugs is now available.

  This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  (RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
  Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
  necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
  architectures with virtualization extensions.

  A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
  pci_unmap_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU space
  exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
  trigger this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network
  traffic. (CVE-2009-3613)

  On x86 platforms, the do_insn_fetch() function did not limit the amount of
  instruction bytes fetched per instruction. Users in guest operating systems
  could leverage this flaw to cause large latencies on SMP hosts that could
  lead to a local denial of service on the host operating system. This update
  fixes this issue by imposing the architecturally-defined 15 byte length
  limit for instructions. (CVE-2009-4031)

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
  Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2009-2695, CVE-2009-2908,
  CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3286, CVE-2009-3547, CVE-2009-3612, CVE-2009-3620,
  CVE-2009-3621, and CVE-2009-3726; acpid issue CVE-2009-4033; expat issues
  CVE-2009-3560 and CVE-2009-3720; and wget issue CVE-2009-3490.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * the scsi_dh_rdac driver was updated to recognize the Sun StorageTek
  Flexline 380. This driver is now also loaded into initrd to handle passive
  paths correctly. Without this initrd change, lots of errors could occur
  during boot, increasing boot time. (BZ#545909)

  * during the firstboot network configuration of the RHEV Hypervisor, it was
  only possible to specify NTP servers by their IP addresses if the RHEV
  Hypervisor system was configured with a static IP address. With this
  update, hostnames can also be used to specify NTP servers. (BZ#545923)

  * with the default settings, performance problems occurred when using the
  qcow2 image format. This could cause guest operating system installations
  to take hours. With this update, performance patches have been backported
  to resolve this issue. (BZ#520693)

  * when using the virtual vm8086 mode, bugs in the emulated hardware task
  switching implementation may have, in some situations, caused older guest
  operating systems to malfunction. (BZ#532031)

  * Windows Server 2003 guests (32-bit) with more than 4GB of memory may have
  crashed during reboot when using the default RHEV Hypervisor settings.
  (BZ#532043)

  * guests continued to run after encountering disk read errors. This could
  have led to their file systems becoming corrupted (but not the host's),
  notably in environments that use networked storage. With this update,
  guests will now pause on disk read and write errors. (BZ#537334, BZ#540406)

  * the para-virtualized block driver (virtio-blk) silently ignored read
  errors when accessing disk images. With this update, the driver correctly
  signals the read error to the guest. (BZ#537334)

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
