  - CVE-2010-2221
summary: |
  An updated scsi-target-utils package that fixes multiple security issues is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The scsi-target-utils package contains the daemon and tools to set up and
  monitor SCSI targets. Currently, iSCSI software and iSER targets are
  supported.

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in scsi-target-utils' tgtd
  daemon. A remote attacker could trigger these flaws by sending a
  carefully-crafted Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) request, causing the
  tgtd daemon to crash. (CVE-2010-2221)

  Red Hat would like to thank the Vulnerability Research Team at TELUS
  Security Labs and Fujita Tomonori for responsibly reporting these flaws.

  All scsi-target-utils users should upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains a backported patch to correct these issues. All running
  scsi-target-utils services must be restarted for the update to take effect.
