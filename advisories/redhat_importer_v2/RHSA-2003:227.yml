summary: |
  Updated Sendmail packages are available for Red Hat Linux on IBM iSeries
  and pSeries systems to fix a vulnerability that allows local and possibly
  remote attackers to gain root privileges as well as a vulnerability that
  may allow remote attackers to gain root privileges by sending a
  carefully crafted message.

  These packages additionally fix a security bug if sendmail is configured to
  use smrsh.

  Sendmail is a widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA).

  A vulnerability exists in unpatched Sendmail versions prior to and
  including 8.12.8. The address parser performs insufficient bounds checking
  in certain conditions due to a char to int conversion, making it possible
  for an attacker to take control of the application.  This issue is probably
  locally exploitable and may also be remotely exploitable.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2003-0161 to this issue.

  During a code audit of Sendmail by ISS, a critical vulnerability was
  uncovered that affects unpatched versions of Sendmail prior to version
  8.12.8. A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted email message
  which, when processed by Sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be
  executed as root. A proof-of-concept exploit is reported to exist, but is
  not believed to be publicly available.

  Since this vulnerability is message-based, MTAs other than Sendmail
  may pass on the carefully crafted message. This means that unpatched
  versions of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if
  they do not accept external connections directly.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2002-1337 to this issue.

  In addition, the restricted shell (SMRSH) in Sendmail allows attackers to
  bypass the intended restrictions of smrsh by inserting additional commands
  after "||" sequences or "/" characters, which are not properly filtered or
  verified. A successful attack would allow an attacker who has a local
  account on a system which has explicitly enabled smrsh to execute arbitrary
  binaries as themselves by utilizing their .forward file. The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
  CAN-2002-1165 to this issue.

  All users are advised to update to these erratum packages containing
  backported patches which correct these vulnerabilities.
