summary: |
  An update for setroubleshoot and setroubleshoot-plugins is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  The setroubleshoot packages provide tools to help diagnose SELinux problems. When Access Vector Cache (AVC) messages are returned, an alert can be generated that provides information about the problem and helps to track its resolution.

  The setroubleshoot-plugins package provides a set of analysis plugins for use with setroubleshoot. Each plugin has the capacity to analyze SELinux AVC data and system data to provide user friendly reports describing how to interpret SELinux AVC denials.

  Security Fix(es):

  * Shell command injection flaws were found in the way the setroubleshoot executed external commands. A local attacker able to trigger certain SELinux denials could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2016-4445, CVE-2016-4989)

  * Shell command injection flaws were found in the way the setroubleshoot allow_execmod and allow_execstack plugins executed external commands. A local attacker able to trigger an execmod or execstack SELinux denial could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. (CVE-2016-4444, CVE-2016-4446)

  The CVE-2016-4444 and CVE-2016-4446 issues were discovered by Milos Malik (Red Hat) and the CVE-2016-4445 and CVE-2016-4989 issues were discovered by Red Hat Product Security.
