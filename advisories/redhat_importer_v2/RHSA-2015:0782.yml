summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not
  properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from
  user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a
  /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,
  Important)

  * A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP
  implementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT
  collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,
  Important)

  * An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Frame
  Buffer device implementation mapped kernel memory to user space via the
  mmap syscall. A local user able to access a frame buffer device file
  (/dev/fb*) could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
  system. (CVE-2013-2596, Important)

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM implementation did not ensure
  that the host CR4 control register value remained unchanged across VM
  entries on the same virtual CPU. A local, unprivileged user could use this
  flaw to cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2014-3690, Moderate)

  * It was found that the parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal() function of the
  Linux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated
  directories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker
  with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image
  to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
  system. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)

  * A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the TechnoTrend/Hauppauge
  DEC USB device driver. A local user with write access to the corresponding
  device could use this flaw to crash the kernel or, potentially, elevate
  their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8884, Low)

  Red Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting CVE-2014-8159, and Andy
  Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-3690. The CVE-2015-1421 issue was
  discovered by Sun Baoliang of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, a NULL pointer check that is needed to prevent an oops in the
  nfs_async_inode_return_delegation() function was removed. As a consequence,
  a NFS4 client could terminate unexpectedly. The missing NULL pointer check
  has been added back, and NFS4 client no longer crashes in this situation.
  (BZ#1187638)

  * Due to unbalanced multicast join and leave processing, the attempt to
  leave a multicast group that had not previously completed a join became
  unresponsive. This update resolves multiple locking issues in the IPoIB
  multicast code that allowed multicast groups to be left before the joining
  was entirely completed. Now, multicast join and leave failures or lockups
  no longer occur in the described situation. (BZ#1187663)

  * A failure to leave a multicast group which had previously been joined
  prevented the attempt to unregister from the "sa" service. Multiple locking
  issues in the IPoIB multicast join and leave processing have been fixed so
  that leaving a group that has completed its join process is successful.
  As a result, attempts to unregister from the "sa" service no longer lock up
  due to leaked resources. (BZ#1187665)

  * Due to a regression, when large reads which partially extended beyond the
  end of the underlying device were done, the raw driver returned the EIO
  error code instead of returning a short read covering the valid part of the
  device. The underlying source code has been patched, and the raw driver now
  returns a short read for the remainder of the device. (BZ#1195746)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
