  - CVE-2025-6176
summary: "An update for brotli is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services\
  \ for SAP Solutions.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security\
  \ impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives\
  \ a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in\
  \ the References section.\n\nBrotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that\
  \ compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding\
  \ and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently\
  \ available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers\
  \ more dense compression. \n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Scrapy: python-scrapy: brotli: Python\
  \ brotli decompression bomb DoS (CVE-2025-6176)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s),\
  \ including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer\
  \ to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section."
