  - CVE-2012-5532
summary: |
  An updated hypervkvpd package that fixes one security issue and one bug is
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The hypervkvpd package contains hypervkvpd, the guest Microsoft Hyper-V
  Key-Value Pair (KVP) daemon. The daemon passes basic information to the
  host through VMBus, such as the guest IP address, fully qualified domain
  name, operating system name, and operating system release number.

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way hypervkvpd processed certain
  Netlink messages. A local, unprivileged user in a guest (running on
  Microsoft Hyper-V) could send a Netlink message that, when processed, would
  cause the guest's hypervkvpd daemon to exit. (CVE-2012-5532)

  The CVE-2012-5532 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
  Product Security Team.

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * The hypervkvpd daemon did not close the file descriptors for pool files
  when they were updated. This could eventually lead to hypervkvpd crashing
  with a "KVP: Failed to open file, pool: 1" error after consuming all
  available file descriptors. With this update, the file descriptors are
  closed, correcting this issue. (BZ#953502)

  Users of hypervkvpd are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contains backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
  update, it is recommended to reboot all guest machines.
