  - CVE-2014-3618
summary: |
  Updated procmail packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The procmail program is used for local mail delivery. In addition to just
  delivering mail, procmail can be used for automatic filtering, presorting,
  and other mail handling jobs.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in procmail's formail utility.
  A remote attacker could send an email with specially crafted headers that,
  when processed by formail, could cause procmail to crash or, possibly,
  execute arbitrary code as the user running formail. (CVE-2014-3618)

  All procmail users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
