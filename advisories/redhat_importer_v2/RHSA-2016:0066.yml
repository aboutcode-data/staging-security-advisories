  spread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML
  files, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local
  database.

  This update serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data
  Virtualization 6.2.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in
  the README file included with the patch files.

  The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

  A flaw was discovered in the way applications using Groovy used the
  standard Java serialization mechanism. A remote attacker could use a
  specially crafted serialized object that would execute code directly when
  deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not
  isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this
  vulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.2.0 as provided from the
  Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
