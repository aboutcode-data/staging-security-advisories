  - CVE-2010-2252
summary: |
  An updated wget package that fixes one security issue and one bug is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The wget package provides the GNU Wget file retrieval utility for HTTP,
  HTTPS, and FTP protocols. Wget provides various useful features, such as
  the ability to work in the background while the user is logged out,
  recursive retrieval of directories, file name wildcard matching or updating
  files in dependency on file timestamp comparison.

  It was discovered that wget used a file name provided by the server when
  saving a downloaded file. This could cause wget to create a file with a
  different name than expected, possibly allowing the server to execute
  arbitrary code on the client. (CVE-2010-2252)

  Note: With this update, wget always uses the last component of the original
  URL as the name for the downloaded file. Previous behavior of using the
  server provided name or the last component of the redirected URL when
  creating files can be re-enabled by using the '--trust-server-names'
  command line option, or by setting 'trust_server_names=on' in the wget
  start-up file.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Prior to this update, the wget package did not recognize HTTPS SSL
  certificates with alternative names (subjectAltName) specified in the
  certificate as valid. As a consequence, running the wget command failed
  with a certificate error. This update fixes wget to recognize such
  certificates as valid. (BZ#1060113)

  All users of wget are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
