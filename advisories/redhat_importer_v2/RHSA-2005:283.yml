summary: "Updated kernel packages are now available as part of ongoing support and\nmaintenance\
  \ of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 2.1. This is the seventh\nregular update.\n\nThis security\
  \ advisory has been rated as having important security impact\nby the Red Hat Security Response\
  \ Team.\n\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThis is\
  \ the seventh regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1\n\nThe following security\
  \ updates were made:\n\nA flaw in fragment queuing was discovered that affected the Linux\
  \ 2.4 and\nLinux 2.6 kernel netfilter subsystem. On systems configured to filter or\nprocess\
  \ network packets (for example those configured to do firewalling),\na remote attacker could\
  \ send a carefully crafted set of fragmented packets\nto a machine and cause a denial of service\
  \ (system crash). In order to\nsucessfully exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to know\
  \ (or guess)\nsome aspects of the firewall ruleset in place on the target system to be\nable\
  \ to craft the right fragmented packets. (CAN-2005-0449)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux\
  \ PPP driver. On systems allowing remote\nusers to connect to a server using ppp, a remote\
  \ client could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0384)\n\nA flaw was discovered\
  \ in the bluetooth driver system. On system where the\nbluetooth modules are loaded, a local\
  \ user could use this flaw to gain\nelevated (root) privileges. (CAN-2005-0750)\n\nAn integer\
  \ overflow flaw was discovered in the ubsec_keysetup function\nin the Broadcom 5820 cryptonet\
  \ driver. On systems using this driver,\na local user could cause a denial of service (crash)\
  \ or possibly gain\nelevated privileges. (CAN-2004-0619) Please note that this update contains\n\
  an unpatched kernel module called bcm5820_old for backwards compatibility\nwhich is still\
  \ vulnerable to CAN-2004-0619. \n\nThe following device drivers have been updated to new versions:\n\
  \n    mptfusion: 2.05.16 -> 2.05.16.02\n    bcm5820: 1.17 -> 1.81\n    cciss: 2.4.52 -> 2.4.54\n\
  \    qla2x00: 6.04.01 -> 7.01.01\n\nThere were many bug fixes in various parts of the kernel.\
  \ The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement\nin the\
  \ reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nBug fixes include:\n   \
  \ - Fixes an incorrect and ever-changing physical_id field in\n      /proc/cpuinfo.\n    -\
  \ Now recognizes a particular e1000 device (PCI ID 8086:1014)\n    - Fixes a panic in disk\
  \ quota code\n    - Fixes a bug in which msync(...MS_SYNC) returns before the data\n     \
  \ is written to disk\n    - Adds new devices to the SCSI scan list so they can\n      be initialized\
  \ and handled properly: LSI ProFibre 4000R, HP\n      HSV200/210, HP MSA, STK OPENstorage\
  \ D178.\n    - Fixes a potential format overflow in /proc/partitions\n    - Restores module\
  \ parameters to the e100 driver for compatibility with     \n      existing customer scripts.\n\
  \    - Fixes a bug in which cat'ing /proc/mdstat while adding/removing\n      devices can\
  \ cause a kernel oops\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their\n\
  kernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as\
  \ listed in this erratum.\n\nPlease note that a vulnerability addressed by this update (CAN-2005-0449)\n\
  required a change to the kernel module ABI which could cause third party\nmodules to not work.\
  \ However, Red Hat is currently not aware of any module\nthat would be affected by this change."
