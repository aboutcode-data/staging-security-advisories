summary: |
  An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues and
  one bug is now available.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
  is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
  everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
  Virtualization Agent.

  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
  the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

  Upgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
  Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may
  appear with the status of "Install Failed". If this happens, place the host
  into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an
  "Up" state.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU processed the SCSI "REPORT
  LUNS" command when more than 256 LUNs were specified for a single SCSI
  target. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process
  memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code
  execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.
  (CVE-2013-4344)

  Multiple flaws were found in the way Linux kernel handled HID (Human
  Interface Device) reports. An attacker with physical access to the system
  could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888, CVE-2013-2889, CVE-2013-2892)

  A flaw was found in the way the Python SSL module handled X.509 certificate
  fields that contain a NULL byte. An attacker could potentially exploit this
  flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers. Note that
  to exploit this issue, an attacker would need to obtain a carefully crafted
  certificate signed by an authority that the client trusts. (CVE-2013-4238)

  The default OpenSSH configuration made it easy for remote attackers to
  exhaust unauthorized connection slots and prevent other users from being
  able to log in to a system. This flaw has been addressed by enabling random
  early connection drops by setting MaxStartups to 10:30:100 by default.
  For more information, refer to the sshd_config(5) man page. (CVE-2010-5107)

  The CVE-2013-4344 issue was discovered by Asias He of Red Hat.

  This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
  various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
  Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
  included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

  CVE-2012-0786 and CVE-2012-0787 (augeas issues)

  CVE-2013-1813 (busybox issue)

  CVE-2013-0221, CVE-2013-0222, and CVE-2013-0223 (coreutils issues)

  CVE-2012-4453 (dracut issue)

  CVE-2013-4332, CVE-2013-0242, and CVE-2013-1914 (glibc issues)

  CVE-2013-4387, CVE-2013-0343, CVE-2013-4345, CVE-2013-4591, CVE-2013-4592,
  CVE-2012-6542, CVE-2013-3231, CVE-2013-1929, CVE-2012-6545, CVE-2013-1928,
  CVE-2013-2164, CVE-2013-2234, and CVE-2013-2851 (kernel issues)

  CVE-2013-4242 (libgcrypt issue)

  CVE-2013-4419 (libguestfs issue)

  CVE-2013-1775, CVE-2013-2776, and CVE-2013-2777 (sudo issues)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * A previous version of the rhev-hypervisor6 package did not contain the
  latest vhostmd package, which provides a "metrics communication channel"
  between a host and its hosted virtual machines, allowing limited
  introspection of host resource usage from within virtual machines. This has
  been fixed, and rhev-hypervisor6 now includes the latest vhostmd package.
  (BZ#1026703)

  This update also contains the fixes from the following errata:

  * ovirt-node: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1528.html

  Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
  upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.
