  - CVE-2015-5366
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's networking
  implementation handled UDP packets with incorrect checksum values. A remote
  attacker could potentially use these flaws to trigger an infinite loop in
  the kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the system, or cause a
  denial of service in applications using the edge triggered epoll
  functionality. (CVE-2015-5364, CVE-2015-5366, Important)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
