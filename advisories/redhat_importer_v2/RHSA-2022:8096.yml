aliases:
  - CVE-2022-24735
  - CVE-2022-24736
summary: |
  An update for redis is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

  Security Fix(es):

  * redis: Code injection via Lua script execution environment (CVE-2022-24735)

  * redis: Malformed Lua script can crash Redis (CVE-2022-24736)

  For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
