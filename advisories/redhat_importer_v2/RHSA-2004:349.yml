  - CVE-2004-0748
summary: "Updated httpd packages that include a security fix for mod_ssl and various\nenhancements\
  \ are now available.\n\nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\n\
  freely-available Web server.\n\nAn input filter bug in mod_ssl was discovered in Apache httpd\
  \ version\n2.0.50 and earlier.  A remote attacker could force an SSL connection to be\naborted\
  \ in a particular state and cause an Apache child process to enter an\ninfinite loop, consuming\
  \ CPU resources.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\
  \ the name CAN-2004-0748 to\nthis issue.\n\nAdditionally, this update includes the following\
  \ enhancements and bug fixes:\n\n- included an improved version of the mod_cgi module that\
  \ correctly handles    \n  concurrent output on stderr and stdout\n\n- included support for\
  \ direct lookup of SSL variables using %{SSL:...}\n  from mod_rewrite, or using %{...}s from\
  \ mod_headers\n\n- restored support for use of SHA1-encoded passwords\n\n- added the mod_ext_filter\
  \ module\n\nUsers of the Apache HTTP server should upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich\
  \ contain backported patches that address these issues."
