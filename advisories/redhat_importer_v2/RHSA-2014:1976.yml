  - CVE-2014-8118
summary: |
  Updated rpm packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven package
  management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying,
  and updating software packages. Each software package consists of an
  archive of files along with information about the package such as its
  version, description, and other information.

  It was found that RPM wrote file contents to the target installation
  directory under a temporary name, and verified its cryptographic signature
  only after the temporary file has been written completely. Under certain
  conditions, the system interprets the unverified temporary file contents
  and extracts commands from it. This could allow an attacker to modify
  signed RPM files in such a way that they would execute code chosen by the
  attacker during package installation. (CVE-2013-6435)

  It was found that RPM could encounter an integer overflow, leading to a
  stack-based buffer overflow, while parsing a crafted CPIO header in the
  payload section of an RPM file. This could allow an attacker to modify
  signed RPM files in such a way that they would execute code chosen by the
  attacker during package installation. (CVE-2014-8118)

  These issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

  All rpm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
  applications linked against the RPM library must be restarted for this
  update to take effect.
