  - CVE-2010-0411
summary: |
  Updated systemtap packages that fix a security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SystemTap is an instrumentation system for systems running the Linux
  kernel, version 2.6. Developers can write scripts to collect data on the
  operation of the system.

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in SystemTap's tapset __get_argv()
  function. If a privileged user ran a SystemTap script that called this
  function, a local, unprivileged user could, while that script is still
  running, trigger this flaw and cause memory corruption by running a command
  with a large argument list, which may lead to a system crash or,
  potentially, arbitrary code execution with root privileges. (CVE-2010-0411)

  Note: SystemTap scripts that call __get_argv(), being a privileged
  function, can only be executed by the root user or users in the stapdev
  group. As well, if such a script was compiled and installed by root, users
  in the stapusr group would also be able to execute it.

  SystemTap users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
  backported patch to correct this issue.
