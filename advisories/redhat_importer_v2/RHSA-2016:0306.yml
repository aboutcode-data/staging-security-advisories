summary: "Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now\navailable for\
  \ Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Lifecycle Support.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated\
  \ this update as having Important security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\
  \ base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability\
  \ from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the\
  \ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well\
  \ as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nA padding oracle flaw was\
  \ found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0\n(SSLv2) protocol. An attacker can potentially\
  \ use this flaw to decrypt\nRSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS\
  \ protocol\nversion, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol\nattack\
  \ is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)\n\nNote: This issue was addressed by disabling\
  \ the SSLv2 protocol by default\nwhen using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing\
  \ support for weak\nSSLv2 cipher suites. It is possible to re-enable the SSLv2 protocol in\
  \ the\n'SSLv23' connection methods by default by setting the OPENSSL_ENABLE_SSL2\nenvironment\
  \ variable before starting an application that needs to have\nSSLv2 enabled. For more information,\
  \ refer to the knowledge base article\nlinked to in the References section.\n\nIt was discovered\
  \ that the SSLv2 servers using OpenSSL accepted SSLv2\nconnection handshakes that indicated\
  \ non-zero clear key length for\nnon-export cipher suites. An attacker could use this flaw\
  \ to decrypt\nrecorded SSLv2 sessions with the server by using it as a decryption \noracle.(CVE-2016-0703)\n\
  \nIt was discovered that the SSLv2 protocol implementation in OpenSSL did \nnot properly implement\
  \ the Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher \nsuites. An attacker could use a SSLv2\
  \ server using OpenSSL as a \nBleichenbacher oracle. (CVE-2016-0704)\n\nNote: The CVE-2016-0703\
  \ and CVE-2016-0704 issues could allow for more\nefficient exploitation of the CVE-2016-0800\
  \ issue via the DROWN attack.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled\
  \ SSLv2\nhandshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\nTLS/SSL server\
  \ using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both\nthe SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade\
  \ cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)\n\nA flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients\
  \ could negotiate SSLv2\nciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could result\
  \ in weak\nSSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to\nman-in-the-middle\
  \ attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting\
  \ these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel as the original\n\
  reporters of CVE-2016-0800 and CVE-2015-3197; David Adrian (University of\nMichigan) and J.\
  \ Alex Halderman (University of Michigan) as the original\nreporters of CVE-2016-0703 and\
  \ CVE-2016-0704; and Sean Burford (Google) and\nEmilia Käsper (OpenSSL development team) as\
  \ the original reporters of\nCVE-2015-0293.\n\nAll openssl users are advised to upgrade to\
  \ these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. For the\
  \ update to take\neffect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or\n\
  the system rebooted."
