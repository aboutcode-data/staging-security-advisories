  - CVE-2015-1805
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue and two bugs are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read
  and write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were
  already processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,
  potentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array
  overrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system
  or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,
  Important)

  The security impact of this issue was discovered by Red Hat.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * The backlog data could previously not be consumed when the
  audit_log_start() function was running even if audit_log_start() called the
  wait_for_auditd() function to consume it. As only auditd could consume the
  backlog data, audit_log_start() terminated unexpectedly. Consequently, the
  system became unresponsive until the backlog timeout was up. With this
  update, audit_log_start() no longer terminates and the system shuts down
  and reboots gracefully in a timely manner. (BZ#1140489)

  * Direct I/O writes extending a parallel file could previously race to
  update the size of the file. If the writes executed in the out-of-order
  manner, the file size could move backwards and push a previously completed
  write beyond EOF, causing it to be lost. With this update, file size
  updates are always executed in appropriate order, thus fixing this bug.
  (BZ#1218497)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
