summary: "Updated rabbitmq-server packages that fix two security issues and a bug\nare now available\
  \ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform \n6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.\n\nRed Hat Product\
  \ Security has rated this update as having Moderate security\nimpact. Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available\
  \ for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n\nRabbitMQ is an\
  \ implementation of AMQP, the emerging standard for high\nperformance enterprise messaging.\
  \ The RabbitMQ server is a robust and\nscalable implementation of an AMQP broker.\n\nA cross-site\
  \ scripting vulnerability was discovered in RabbitMQ, which \nallowed using api/ path info\
  \ to inject and receive data. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to create an \"/api/...\"\
  \ URL, forcing a\nserver error that resulted in the server returning an HTML page with\nembedded\
  \ text from the URL (not escaped). (CVE-2014-9649)\n\nA response-splitting vulnerability was\
  \ discovered in RabbitMQ. An\n/api/definitions URL could be specified, which then caused an\
  \ arbitrary\nadditional header to be returned. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto inject\
  \ arbitrary HTTP headers and possibly gain access to secure data.\n(CVE-2014-9650)\n\nThis\
  \ update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, if the rabbit_mirror_queue_master\
  \ did not return when using\nHA and 'auto_delete' queues, the RabbitMQ server blocked channels\
  \ during \ntermination. These channels would then have no associated connections and \nwere\
  \ displayed as 'unknown'. This issue has been resolved. (BZ#1303747)\n\nAll rabbitmq-server\
  \ users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches\
  \ to correct these issues."
