  - CVE-2004-0977
summary: "Updated rh-postgresql packages that fix various bugs are now available.\n\nPostgreSQL\
  \ is an advanced Object-Relational database management system\n(DBMS) that supports almost\
  \ all SQL constructs (including transactions,\nsubselects, and user-defined types and functions).\n\
  \nTrustix has identified improper temporary file usage in the\nmake_oidjoins_check script.\
  \  It is possible that an attacker could\noverwrite arbitrary file contents as the user running\
  \ the\nmake_oidjoins_check script.  This script has been removed from the RPM file\nsince\
  \ it has no use to ordinary users.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org)\
  \ has assigned the name CAN-2004-0977 to\nthis issue.\n\nAdditionally, the following non-security\
  \ issues have been addressed:\n\n- Fixed a low probability risk for loss of recently committed\
  \ transactions.\n\n- Fixed a low probability risk for loss of older data due to failure to\
  \ \n  update transaction status.\n\n- A lock file problem that sometimes prevented automatic\
  \ restart after a \n  system crash has been fixed.\n\nAll users of rh-postgresql should upgrade\
  \ to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues."
