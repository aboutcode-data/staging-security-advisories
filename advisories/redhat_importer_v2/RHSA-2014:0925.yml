  - CVE-2014-4699
  - CVE-2014-4943
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * It was found that the Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem allowed a traced
  process' instruction pointer to be set to a non-canonical memory address
  without forcing the non-sysret code path when returning to user space.
  A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-4699,
  Important)

  Note: The CVE-2014-4699 issue only affected systems using an Intel CPU.

  * A flaw was found in the way the pppol2tp_setsockopt() and
  pppol2tp_getsockopt() functions in the Linux kernel's PPP over L2TP
  implementation handled requests with a non-SOL_PPPOL2TP socket option
  level. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their
  privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-4943, Important)

  Red Hat would like to thank Andy Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-4699,
  and Sasha Levin for reporting CVE-2014-4943.

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
