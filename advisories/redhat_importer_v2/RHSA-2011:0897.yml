summary: |
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 is now available for Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JBoss Enterprise Web Server is a fully-integrated and certified set of
  components for hosting Java web applications.

  This is the first release of JBoss Enterprise Web Server for Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 6. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, this release
  serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1, and includes
  a number of bug fixes. Refer to the Release Notes, linked in the
  References, for more information.

  This update corrects security flaws in the following components:

  tomcat6:

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager application,
  used for managing web applications on Apache Tomcat. If a remote attacker
  could trick a user who is logged into the Manager application into visiting
  a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could perform Manager application
  tasks with the privileges of the logged in user. (CVE-2010-4172)

  tomcat5 and tomcat6:

  It was found that web applications could modify the location of the Apache
  Tomcat host's work directory. As web applications deployed on Tomcat have
  read and write access to this directory, a malicious web application could
  use this flaw to trick Tomcat into giving it read and write access to an
  arbitrary directory on the file system. (CVE-2010-3718)

  A second cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Manager
  application. A malicious web application could use this flaw to conduct an
  XSS attack, leading to arbitrary web script execution with the privileges
  of victims who are logged into and viewing Manager application web pages.
  (CVE-2011-0013)

  A possible minor information leak was found in the way Apache Tomcat
  generated HTTP BASIC and DIGEST authentication requests. For configurations
  where a realm name was not specified and Tomcat was accessed via a proxy,
  the default generated realm contained the hostname and port used by the
  proxy to send requests to the Tomcat server. (CVE-2010-1157)

  httpd:

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
  handled certain requests. If a remote attacker were to send a carefully
  crafted request to the server, it could cause the httpd child process to
  crash. (CVE-2010-1452)

  apr:

  It was found that the apr_fnmatch() function used an unconstrained
  recursion when processing patterns with the '*' wildcard. An attacker could
  use this flaw to cause an application using this function, which also
  accepted untrusted input as a pattern for matching (such as an httpd server
  using the mod_autoindex module), to exhaust all stack memory or use an
  excessive amount of CPU time when performing matching. (CVE-2011-0419)

  apr-util:

  It was found that certain input could cause the apr-util library to
  allocate more memory than intended in the apr_brigade_split_line()
  function. An attacker able to provide input in small chunks to an
  application using the apr-util library (such as httpd) could possibly use
  this flaw to trigger high memory consumption. Note: This issue only
  affected the JBoss Enterprise Web Server packages on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 4. (CVE-2010-1623)

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.1 are advised to upgrade to
  JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2, which corrects these issues. After
  installing this update, the relevant Apache Tomcat service ("tomcat5" or
  "tomcat6") and the Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") must be restarted for the
  update to take effect.
