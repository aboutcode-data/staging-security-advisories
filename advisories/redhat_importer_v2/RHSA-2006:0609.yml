summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs in the mozilla
  package are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  Seamonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
  client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

  The Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Suite. This
  update deprecates the Mozilla Suite in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in
  favor of the supported Seamonkey Suite.

  This update also resolves a number of outstanding Mozilla security issues:

  Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
  actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript
  instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
  sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,
  CVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809,
  CVE-2006-3812)

  Several denial of service flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
  certain web content. A malicious web page could crash the browser or
  possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Seamonkey.
  (CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3113,
  CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)

  Two flaws were found in the way Seamonkey-mail displayed malformed
  inline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing
  a carefully crafted vcard it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the
  user running Mozilla-mail. (CVE-2006-2781, CVE-2006-3804)

  A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed
  Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web
  page could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer
  could miss due to a malformed "script" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)

  Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
  actions. A malicious web page could conduct a cross-site scripting attack
  or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by other domains).
  (CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)

  A form file upload flaw was found in the way Seamonkey handled javascript
  input object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local
  file at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way Seamonkey called the
  crypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the
  browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)

  Two HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
  certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return
  specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy
  restrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)

  A flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts. A
  malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript
  instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
  sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-3808)

  A double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was
  called. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible
  to execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. (CVE-2006-2788)

  Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
  Seamonkey version 1.0.3 that corrects these issues.
