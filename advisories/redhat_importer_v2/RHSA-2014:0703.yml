  - CVE-2013-6371
summary: |
  Updated json-c packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  JSON-C implements a reference counting object model that allows you to
  easily construct JSON objects in C, output them as JSON-formatted strings,
  and parse JSON-formatted strings back into the C representation of
  JSON objects.

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the json-c library
  handled long strings in JSON documents. An attacker able to make an
  application using json-c parse excessively large JSON input could cause the
  application to crash. (CVE-2013-6370)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of hash arrays in
  json-c. An attacker could use this flaw to make an application using json-c
  consume an excessive amount of CPU time by providing a specially crafted
  JSON document that triggers multiple hash function collisions. To mitigate
  this issue, json-c now uses a different hash function and randomization to
  reduce the chance of an attacker successfully causing intentional
  collisions. (CVE-2013-6371)

  These issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
  Security Team.

  All json-c users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues.
