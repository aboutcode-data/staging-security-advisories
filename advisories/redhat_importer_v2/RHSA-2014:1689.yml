  - CVE-2014-8750
summary: |
  Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue, several bugs,
  and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
  machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
  Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
  orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
  networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

  A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
  VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
  unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
  repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
  VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

  The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
  2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
  previous version. (BZ#1146086)

  This update also fixes the following bug:

  * Prior to this update, certain RPC messages were not sending the correct
  data format when the version cap was set. During a live upgrade from Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  OpenStack Platform 5.0, when there were Compute nodes running different
  versions of the code, some operations would fail on the Compute hosts that
  were not upgraded. With this update, proper version of the data is sent in
  all cases, and all RPC calls succeed during the live migration.
  (BZ#1083625)

  All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
