  - CVE-2012-2150
summary: |
  Updated xfsprogs packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
  add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  The xfsprogs packages contain a set of commands to use the XFS file system,
  including the mkfs.xfs command to construct an XFS system.

  It was discovered that the xfs_metadump tool of the xfsprogs suite did not
  fully adhere to the standards of obfuscation described in its man page. In
  case a user with the necessary privileges used xfs_metadump and relied on
  the advertised obfuscation, the generated data could contain unexpected
  traces of potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2012-2150)

  The xfsprogs packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.2.2, which
  provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
  This release also includes updates present in upstream version 3.2.3,
  although it omits the mkfs.xfs default disk format change (for metadata
  checksumming) which is present upstream. (BZ#1223991)

  Users of xfsprogs are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  fix these bugs and add these enhancements.
