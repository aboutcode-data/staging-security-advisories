summary: |
  Updated XFree86 packages that fix several security issues in libXpm, as
  well as other bug fixes, are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

  XFree86 is an open source implementation of the X Window System. It
  provides the basic low level functionality which full fledged graphical
  user interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed upon.

  During a source code audit, Chris Evans discovered several stack overflow
  flaws and an integer overflow flaw in the X.Org libXpm library used to
  decode XPM (X PixMap) images. An attacker could create a carefully crafted
  XPM file which would cause an application to crash or potentially execute
  arbitrary code if opened by a victim. The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-0687,
  CAN-2004-0688, and CAN-2004-0692 to these issues.

  These packages also contain a bug fix to lower the RGB output voltage on
  Dell servers using the ATI Radeon 7000m card.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues.
