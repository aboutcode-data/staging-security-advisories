summary: "A security update for Debezium is now available for Red Hat Integration.\n\nRed Hat\
  \ Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability\
  \ Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for\
  \ each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nDebezium is a distributed\
  \ platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see\
  \ and respond immediately to each row-level change in the databases.\n\nDebezium is built\
  \ on top of Apache Kafka and provides Kafka Connect compatible connectors that monitor specific\
  \ database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs,\
  \ from where your application consumes them. This makes it possible for your application to\
  \ easily consume all of the events correctly and completely. Even if your application stops\
  \ unexpectedly, it will not miss anything: when the application restarts, it will resume consuming\
  \ the events where it left off.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* jdbc-postgresql: postgresql-jdbc:\
  \ PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream) will create a temporary file if the InputStream\
  \ is larger than 2k (CVE-2022-41946) \n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including\
  \ the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\
  \ page(s) listed in the References section."
