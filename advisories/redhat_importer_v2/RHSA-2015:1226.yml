summary: |
  An update for the PortletBridge component of Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.2.0
  that fixes one security issue is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
  impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
  gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Portal is the open source implementation of the Java EE suite
  of services and Portal services running atop Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
  Application Platform.

  It was found that JavaServer Faces PortletBridge-based portlets using
  GenericPortlet's default resource serving did not restrict access to
  resources within the web application. An attacker could set the resource ID
  field of a URL to potentially bypass security constraints and gain access
  to restricted resources. (CVE-2015-3244)

  Red Hat would like to thank Liferay, Inc. for reporting this issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.2.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
