  - CVE-2011-3919
summary: |
  Updated libxml2 packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The libxml2 library is a development toolbox providing the implementation
  of various XML standards.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
  entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
  specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
  against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
  application. (CVE-2011-3919)

  An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker
  could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an
  application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash.
  (CVE-2011-3905)

  All users of libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain backported patches to correct these issues. The desktop must
  be restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.
