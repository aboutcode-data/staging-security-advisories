  - CVE-2013-1897
summary: "Updated 389-ds-base packages that fix one security issue and several bugs\nare now\
  \ available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated\
  \ this update as having low\nsecurity impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\
  \ base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\n\
  the References section.\n\nThe 389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base\
  \ packages\ninclude the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and\ncommand-line\
  \ utilities for server administration.\n \nIt was found that the 389 Directory Server did\
  \ not properly restrict access\nto entries when the \"nsslapd-allow-anonymous-access\" configuration\
  \ setting\nwas set to \"rootdse\". An anonymous user could connect to the LDAP database\n\
  and, if the search scope is set to BASE, obtain access to information\noutside of the rootDSE.\
  \ (CVE-2013-1897)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Martin Kosek of Red Hat.\n\nThis update\
  \ also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the schema-reload plug-in was not thread-safe.\
  \ Consequently,\nexecuting the schema-reload.pl script under heavy load could have caused\n\
  the ns-slapd process to terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault.\nCurrently, the\
  \ schema-reload plug-in is re-designed so that it is\nthread-safe, and the schema-reload.pl\
  \ script can be executed along with\nother LDAP operations. (BZ#929107)\n\n* An out of scope\
  \ problem for a local variable, in some cases, caused the\nmodrdn operation to terminate unexpectedly\
  \ with a segmentation fault. This\nupdate declares the local variable at the proper place\
  \ of the function so\nit does not go out of scope, and the modrdn operation no longer crashes.\n\
  (BZ#929111)\n\n* A task manually constructed an exact value to be removed from the\nconfiguration\
  \ if the \"replica-force-cleaning\" option was used.\nConsequently, the task configuration\
  \ was not cleaned up, and every time the\nserver was restarted, the task behaved in the described\
  \ manner. This update\nsearches the configuration for the exact value to delete, instead of\n\
  manually building the value, and the task does not restart when the server\nis restarted.\
  \ (BZ#929114)\n\n* Previously, a NULL pointer dereference could have occurred when\nattempting\
  \ to get effective rights on an entry that did not exist, leading\nto an unexpected termination\
  \ due to a segmentation fault. This update\nchecks for NULL entry pointers and returns the\
  \ appropriate error. Now,\nattempts to get effective rights on an entry that does not exist\
  \ no longer\ncauses crashes, and the server returns the appropriate error message.\n(BZ#929115)\n\
  \n* A problem in the lock timing in the DNA plug-in caused a deadlock if the\nDNA operation\
  \ was executed with other plug-ins. This update moves the\nrelease timing of the problematic\
  \ lock, and the DNA plug-in does not cause\nthe deadlock. (BZ#929196)\n\nAll 389-ds-base users\
  \ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct\
  \ these issues. After installing\nthis update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically."
