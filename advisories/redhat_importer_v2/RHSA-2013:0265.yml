summary: |
  An update for the Apache Tomcat 6 component for JBoss Enterprise Web Server
  2.0.0 that fixes multiple security issues is now available from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container.

  It was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a
  protected resource could bypass the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  prevention filter. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
  CSRF attacks against applications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter
  and do not contain internal mitigation for CSRF. (CVE-2012-4431)

  A flaw was found in the way Tomcat handled sendfile operations when using
  the HTTP NIO (Non-Blocking I/O) connector and HTTPS. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). The HTTP
  NIO connector is used by default in JBoss Enterprise Web Server. The Apache
  Portable Runtime (APR) connector from the Tomcat Native library was not
  affected by this flaw. (CVE-2012-4534)

  Multiple weaknesses were found in the Tomcat DIGEST authentication
  implementation, effectively reducing the security normally provided by
  DIGEST authentication. A remote attacker could use these flaws to perform
  replay attacks in some circumstances. (CVE-2012-5885, CVE-2012-5886,
  CVE-2012-5887)

  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the Tomcat HTTP NIO connector
  enforced limits on the permitted size of request headers. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to trigger an OutOfMemoryError by sending a
  specially-crafted request with very large headers. The HTTP NIO connector
  is used by default in JBoss Enterprise Web Server. The APR connector from
  the Tomcat Native library was not affected by this flaw. (CVE-2012-2733)

  Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
  Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
  files).

  All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
