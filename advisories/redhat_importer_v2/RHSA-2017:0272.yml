summary: |
  An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data spread across physically distinct systems - such as multiple databases, XML files, and even Hadoop systems - appear as a set of tables in a local database.

  This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3 Update 4 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3 Update 3, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

  Security Fix(es):

  * It was found that a flaw in apache groovy library allows remote code execution wherever deserialization occurs in the application. It is possible for an attacker to craft a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this vulnerability. (CVE-2016-6814)

  * It was found that the parsing of XMP and other XML formats in PDF by Apache PDFBox would expand entity references. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2016-2175)

  * It was found that the parsing of OOXML, XMP in PDF, and some other file formats by Apache Tika would expand entity references. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2016-4434)
