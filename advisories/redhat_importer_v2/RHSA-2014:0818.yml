  This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.2 serves as a replacement for Red
  Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the
  Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.2 Release Notes for information on the most

  The following security issues are fixed with this release:

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  It was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not
  verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains.
  A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and
  obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)

  It was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not
  verify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker
  could use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)

  A flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could
  allow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a
  series of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on
  the server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2014-0193)

  Red Hat would like to thank James Roper of Typesafe for reporting the
  CVE-2014-0193 issue.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
  Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.0.2.
