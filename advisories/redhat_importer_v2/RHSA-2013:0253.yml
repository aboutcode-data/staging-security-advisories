  - CVE-2013-0247
summary: |
  Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and two
  bugs are now available for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation
  of the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,
  Catalog, and Policy services.

  It was found that an excessive amount of information was logged when
  invalid tokens were requested, resulting in large log files. An attacker
  could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of disk space by
  requesting a large number of invalid tokens. (CVE-2013-0247)

  The CVE-2013-0247 issue was discovered by Dan Prince of Red Hat.

  This update also fixes two bugs that could have caused 'keystone' commands
  (such as 'keystone endpoint-delete' and 'keystone service-get') to fail
  with a 'No handlers could be found for logger "keystoneclient.v2_0.client"'
  and 'Authorization Failed' error. (BZ#857290, BZ#888328)

  All users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated
  packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted
  automatically.
