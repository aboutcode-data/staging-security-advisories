  - CVE-2010-0407
summary: |
  Updated pcsc-lite packages that fix multiple security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  PC/SC Lite provides a Windows SCard compatible interface for communicating
  with smart cards, smart card readers, and other security tokens.

  Multiple buffer overflow flaws were discovered in the way the pcscd daemon,
  a resource manager that coordinates communications with smart card readers
  and smart cards connected to the system, handled client requests. A local
  user could create a specially-crafted request that would cause the pcscd
  daemon to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-0407,
  CVE-2009-4901)

  Users of pcsc-lite should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  a backported patch to correct these issues. After installing this update,
  the pcscd daemon will be restarted automatically.
