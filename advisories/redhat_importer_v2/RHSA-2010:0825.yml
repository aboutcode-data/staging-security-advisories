summary: |
  Updated mysql packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
  the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

  It was found that the MySQL PolyFromWKB() function did not sanity check
  Well-Known Binary (WKB) data. A remote, authenticated attacker could use
  specially-crafted WKB data to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a
  temporary denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after
  the crash. (CVE-2010-3840)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed certain JOIN queries. If a
  stored procedure contained JOIN queries, and that procedure was executed
  twice in sequence, it could cause an infinite loop, leading to excessive
  CPU use (up to 100%). A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw
  to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3839)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed queries that provide a mixture
  of numeric and longblob data types to the LEAST or GREATEST function. A
  remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This
  issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was
  automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3838)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed PREPARE statements containing
  both GROUP_CONCAT and the WITH ROLLUP modifier. A remote, authenticated
  attacker could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a
  temporary denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after
  the crash. (CVE-2010-3837)

  It was found that MySQL did not properly pre-evaluate LIKE arguments in
  view prepare mode. A remote, authenticated attacker could possibly use this
  flaw to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3836)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed statements that assign a value
  to a user-defined variable and that also contain a logical value
  evaluation. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash
  mysqld. This issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was
  automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3835)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL evaluated the arguments of extreme-value
  functions, such as LEAST and GREATEST. A remote, authenticated attacker
  could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a temporary
  denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after the crash.
  (CVE-2010-3833)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed EXPLAIN statements for some
  complex SELECT queries. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this
  flaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a temporary denial of service,
  as mysqld was automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3682)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed certain alternating READ
  requests provided by HANDLER statements. A remote, authenticated attacker
  could use this flaw to provide such requests, causing mysqld to crash. This
  issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was
  automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3681)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
  statements that define NULL columns when using the InnoDB storage engine. A
  remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This
  issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was
  automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3680)

  A flaw was found in the way MySQL processed JOIN queries that attempt to
  retrieve data from a unique SET column. A remote, authenticated attacker
  could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a temporary
  denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after the crash.
  (CVE-2010-3677)

  All MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
  update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.
