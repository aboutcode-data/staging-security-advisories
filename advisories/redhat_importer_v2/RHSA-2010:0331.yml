  - CVE-2010-0727
summary: |
  Updated GFS-kernel packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8, kernel release 2.6.9-89.0.20.EL.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The GFS-kernel packages contain modules that provide the ability to mount
  and use GFS file systems.

  A flaw was found in the gfs_lock() implementation. The GFS locking code
  could skip the lock operation for files that have the S_ISGID bit
  (set-group-ID on execution) in their mode set. A local, unprivileged user
  on a system that has a GFS file system mounted could use this flaw to cause
  a kernel panic. (CVE-2010-0727)

  As well, these updated GFS-kernel packages are in sync with the latest
  kernel (2.6.9-89.0.20.EL). The modules in earlier GFS-kernel packages fail
  to load because they do not match the running kernel. It is possible to
  force-load the modules; however, with this update, force-loading the
  modules is not required.

  Users are advised to upgrade to these latest GFS-kernel packages, which
  resolve this issue and are updated for use with the 2.6.9-89.0.20.EL
  kernel.
