summary: |
  An update for Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 which fixes multiple
  security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

  Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
  impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
  detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
  CVE links in the References section.

  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
  automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
  existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
  CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
  execution speed and quality.

  It was found that the code which checked that the server hostname matches
  the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates
  was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an
  SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153,
  CVE-2014-3577)

  It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
  content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
  XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
  including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
  XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

  It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
  insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
  A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
  Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
  Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
  secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
  classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
  context of the application server running the application that uses
  Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

  It was found that the org.jboss.seam.web.AuthenticationFilter class
  implementation did not properly use Seam logging. A remote attacker could
  send specially crafted authentication headers to an application, which
  could result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
  running that application. (CVE-2014-0248)

  It was found that the implementation of the
  org.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method
  provided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.
  A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files
  accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
  perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)

  It was discovered that the implementation used by the Not Yet Commons SSL
  project to check that the server host name matches the domain name in the
  subject's CN field was flawed. This could be exploited by a
  man-in-the-middle attacker by spoofing a valid certificate using a
  specially crafted subject. (CVE-2014-3604)

  Red Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting
  CVE-2014-3530. The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of
  Red Hat Product Security, the CVE-2014-3604 issue was discovered by Arun
  Babu Neelicattu of Red Hat Product Security, and the CVE-2014-0248 issue
  was discovered by Marek Schmidt of Red Hat.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat
  Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.
