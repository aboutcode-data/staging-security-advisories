summary: |
  An updated openstack-heat-templates package that fixes three security
  issues is now available Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify
  and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking.
  It can also be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn
  allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and
  applications. Orchestration can also be integrated with Telemetry alarms to
  implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.

  The openstack-heat-templates package provides heat example templates and
  image building elements for the openstack-heat package.

  It was discovered that certain heat templates used HTTP to insecurely
  download packages and signing keys via Yum. An attacker could use this flaw
  to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to prevent essential security updates
  from being installed on the system. (CVE-2014-0040)

  It was found that certain heat templates disabled SSL protection for
  various Yum repositories (sslverify=false). An attacker could use this flaw
  to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to prevent essential security updates
  from being installed on the system. (CVE-2014-0041)

  It was discovered that certain heat templates disabled GPG signature
  checking of packages via Yum (gpgcheck=0). An attacker could use this flaw
  to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to install arbitrary packages on the
  system. (CVE-2014-0042)

  These issues were discovered by Grant Murphy of the Red Hat Product
  Security Team.

  All openstack-heat-templates users are advised to upgrade to this updated
  package, which corrects these issues.
