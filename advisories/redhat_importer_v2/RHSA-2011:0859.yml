  - CVE-2011-1926
summary: |
  Updated cyrus-imapd packages that fix one security issue are now available
  for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
  which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
  the References section.

  The cyrus-imapd packages contain a high-performance mail server with IMAP,
  POP3, NNTP, and Sieve support.

  It was discovered that cyrus-imapd did not flush the received commands
  buffer after switching to TLS encryption for IMAP, LMTP, NNTP, and POP3
  sessions. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to inject
  protocol commands into a victim's TLS session initialization messages. This
  could lead to those commands being processed by cyrus-imapd, potentially
  allowing the attacker to steal the victim's mail or authentication
  credentials. (CVE-2011-1926)

  Users of cyrus-imapd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
  which contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing
  the update, cyrus-imapd will be restarted automatically.
