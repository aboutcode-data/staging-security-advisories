  - CVE-2010-2791
summary: |
  Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues and multiple bugs are
  now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

  A flaw was discovered in the way the mod_proxy module of the Apache HTTP
  Server handled the timeouts of requests forwarded by a reverse proxy to the
  back-end server. If the proxy was configured to reuse existing back-end
  connections, it could return a response intended for another user under
  certain timeout conditions, possibly leading to information disclosure.
  (CVE-2010-2791)

  A flaw was found in the way the mod_dav module of the Apache HTTP Server
  handled certain requests. If a remote attacker were to send a carefully
  crafted request to the server, it could cause the httpd child process to
  crash. (CVE-2010-1452)

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * numerous issues in the INFLATE filter provided by mod_deflate. "Inflate
  error -5 on flush" errors may have been logged. This update upgrades
  mod_deflate to the newer upstream version from Apache HTTP Server 2.2.15.
  (BZ#625435)

  * the response would be corrupted if mod_filter applied the DEFLATE filter
  to a resource requiring a subrequest with an internal redirect. (BZ#625451)

  * the OID() function used in the mod_ssl "SSLRequire" directive did not
  correctly evaluate extensions of an unknown type. (BZ#625452)

  All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
  packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.
