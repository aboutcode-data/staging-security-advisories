  - CVE-2013-2051
summary: |
  Updated tomcat6 packages that fix two security issues are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  Apache Tomcat is a servlet container for the Java Servlet and JavaServer
  Pages (JSP) technologies.

  A flaw was found in the way the tomcat6 init script handled the
  tomcat6-initd.log log file. A malicious web application deployed on Tomcat
  could use this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack to change the
  ownership of an arbitrary system file to that of the tomcat user, allowing
  them to escalate their privileges to root. (CVE-2013-1976)

  Note: With this update, tomcat6-initd.log has been moved from
  /var/log/tomcat6/ to the /var/log/ directory.

  It was found that the RHSA-2013:0623 update did not correctly fix
  CVE-2012-5887, a weakness in the Tomcat DIGEST authentication
  implementation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform replay
  attacks in some circumstances. Additionally, this problem also prevented
  users from being able to authenticate using DIGEST authentication.
  (CVE-2013-2051)

  Red Hat would like to thank Simon Fayer of Imperial College London for
  reporting the CVE-2013-1976 issue.

  Users of Tomcat are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  correct these issues. Tomcat must be restarted for this update to take
  effect.
