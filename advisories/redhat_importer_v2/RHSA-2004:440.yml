summary: |
  An updated lha package that fixes a buffer overflow is now available.

  LHA is an archiving and compression utility for LHarc format archives.

  Lukasz Wojtow discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in all versions
  of lha up to and including version 1.14.  A carefully created archive could
  allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when a victim extracts or tests
  the archive.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0769 to this issue.

  Buffer overflows were discovered in the command line processing of all
  versions of lha up to and including version 1.14.  If a malicious user can
  trick a victim into passing a specially crafted command line to the lha
  command, it is possible that arbitrary code could be executed.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
  names CAN-2004-0771 and CAN-2004-0694 to these issues.

  Thomas Biege discovered a shell meta character command execution
  vulnerability in all versions of lha up to and including 1.14.  An attacker
  could create a directory with shell meta characters in its name which could
  lead to arbitrary command execution.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
  Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0745 to
  this issue.

  Users of lha should update to this updated package which contains
  backported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.
