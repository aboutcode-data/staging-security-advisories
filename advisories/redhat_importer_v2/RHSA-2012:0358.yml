summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and various bugs
  are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
  scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
  vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  This update fixes the following security issues:

  * Using PCI passthrough without interrupt remapping support allowed Xen
  hypervisor guests to generate MSI interrupts and thus potentially inject
  traps. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host or
  possibly escalate their privileges on the host. The fix for this issue can
  prevent PCI passthrough working and guests starting. Refer to Red Hat
  Bugzilla bug 715555 for details. (CVE-2011-1898, Important)

  * IPv6 fragment identification value generation could allow a remote
  attacker to disrupt a target system's networking, preventing legitimate
  users from accessing its services. (CVE-2011-2699, Important)

  * Using the SG_IO ioctl to issue SCSI requests to partitions or LVM volumes
  resulted in the requests being passed to the underlying block device. If a
  privileged user only had access to a single partition or LVM volume, they
  could use this flaw to bypass those restrictions and gain read and write
  access (and be able to issue other SCSI commands) to the entire block
  device. Refer to Red Hat Knowledgebase article 67869, linked to in the
  References, for further details about this issue. (CVE-2011-4127,
  Important)

  * A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled robust list pointers
  of user-space held futexes across exec() calls. A local, unprivileged user
  could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, eventually, escalate
  their privileges. (CVE-2012-0028, Important)

  * A missing boundary check was found in the Linux kernel's HFS file system
  implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of
  service or escalate their privileges by mounting a specially-crafted disk.
  (CVE-2011-4330, Moderate)

  Red Hat would like to thank Fernando Gont for reporting CVE-2011-2699, and
  Clement Lecigne for reporting CVE-2011-4330.

  This update also fixes the following bugs:

  * Previously, all timers for a Xen fully-virtualized domain were based on
  the time stamp counter (TSC) of the underlying physical CPU. This could
  cause observed time to go backwards on some hosts. This update moves all
  timers except HPET to the Xen monotonic system time, which fixes the bug as
  long as the HPET is removed from the configuration of the domain.
  (BZ#773359)

  * Previously, tests of the Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation
  Program (SVVP) detected unreliability of the emulated HPET (High
  Performance Event Timer) on some hosts. Now, HPET can be configured as a
  per-domain configuration option; if it is disabled, the guest chooses a
  more reliable timer source. Disabling HPET is suggested for Windows guests,
  as well as fully-virtualized Linux guests that show occasional "time went
  backwards" errors in the console. (BZ#773360)

  * SG_IO ioctls were not implemented correctly in the Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux 5 virtio-blk driver. Sending an SG_IO ioctl request to a virtio-blk
  disk caused the sending thread to enter an uninterruptible sleep state ("D"
  state). With this update, SG_IO ioctls are rejected by the virtio-blk
  driver; the ioctl system call simply returns an ENOTTY ("Inappropriate
  ioctl for device") error and the thread continues normally. (BZ#784658)

  Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
  patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
  update to take effect.
