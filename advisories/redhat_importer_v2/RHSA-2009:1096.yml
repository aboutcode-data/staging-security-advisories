summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
  Hat Security Response Team.

  SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2009-1392, CVE-2009-1833, CVE-2009-1838, CVE-2009-1841)

  A flaw was found in the processing of malformed, local file content. If a
  user loaded malicious, local content via the file:// URL, it was possible
  for that content to access other local data. (CVE-2009-1835)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
