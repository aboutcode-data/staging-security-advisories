summary: |
  An updated Squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

  SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.

  Jimmy Conner discovered a missing variable initialization in Squirrelmail.
  This flaw could allow potential insecure file inclusions on servers where
  the PHP setting "register_globals" is set to "On". This is not a default or
  recommended setting.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
  (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0075 to this issue.

  A URL sanitisation bug was found in Squirrelmail. This flaw could allow a
  cross site scripting attack when loading the URL for the sidebar. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
  the name CAN-2005-0103 to this issue.

  Users of Squirrelmail are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
  which contains backported patches to correct these issues.
