  References section.

  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java
  applications based on JBoss Application Server 7.

  A resource consumption issue was found in the way Xerces-J handled XML
  declarations. A remote attacker could use an XML document with a specially
  crafted declaration using a long pseudo-attribute name that, when parsed by
  an application using Xerces-J, would cause that application to use an
  excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2013-4002)

  This release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform also includes bug
  fixes and enhancements. A list of these changes is available from the JBoss
  Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.2 Downloads page on the Customer
  Portal.

  All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3 as provided
  from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
  The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.
