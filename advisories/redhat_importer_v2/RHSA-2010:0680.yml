summary: |
  Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
  available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
  security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
  which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
  from the CVE links in the References section.

  SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
  chat client, and HTML editor.

  Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
  page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  SeaMonkey. (CVE-2010-3169)

  A buffer overflow flaw was found in SeaMonkey. A web page containing
  malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or, potentially, execute
  arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey.
  (CVE-2010-2765)

  A use-after-free flaw and several dangling pointer flaws were found in
  SeaMonkey. A web page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to
  crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
  user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2010-2760, CVE-2010-2767, CVE-2010-3167,
  CVE-2010-3168)

  A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in SeaMonkey. A web page
  containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to run JavaScript code
  with the permissions of a different website. (CVE-2010-2768)

  All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
  these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
  the changes to take effect.
