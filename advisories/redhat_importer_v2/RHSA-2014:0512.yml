  - CVE-2014-0196
summary: |
  Updated kernel packages that fix one security issue are now available for
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 Extended Update Support.

  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
  Important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
  CVE link in the References section.

  The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
  operating system.

  * A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found
  in the way the Linux kernel's N_TTY line discipline (LDISC) implementation
  handled concurrent processing of echo output and TTY write operations
  originating from user space when the underlying TTY driver was PTY.
  An unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
  potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-0196,
  Important)

  All kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain a backported patch to correct this issue. The system must be
  rebooted for this update to take effect.
