summary: |
  CVE-2019-12399 Apache Kafka Connect REST API may expose plaintext secrets in tasks endpoint
  When Connect workers in Apache Kafka 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, or 2.3.0 are configured with one or more config providers, and a connector is created/updated on that Connect cluster to use an externalized secret variable in a substring of a connector configuration property value (the externalized secret variable is not the whole configuration property value), then any client can issue a request to the same Connect cluster to obtain the connector’s task configurations and the response will contain the plaintext secret rather than the externalized secrets variable. Users should upgrade to 2.2.2 or higher, or 2.3.1 or higher where this vulnerability has been fixed.
