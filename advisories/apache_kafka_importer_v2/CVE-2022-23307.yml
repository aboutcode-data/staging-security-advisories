  CVE-2022-23307 Deserialization of Untrusted Data Flaw in Apache Log4j logging library in versions 1.x
  This CVE identified a flaw where it allows an attacker to send a malicious request with serialized data to the component running log4j 1.x to be deserialized when the chainsaw component is run. Chainsaw is a standalone GUI for viewing log entries in log4j. An attacker not only needs to be able to generate malicious log entries, but also, have the necessary access and permissions to start chainsaw (or if it is already enabled by a customer / consumer of Apache Kafka).
