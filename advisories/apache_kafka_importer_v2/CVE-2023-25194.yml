summary: |
  CVE-2023-25194 Possible RCE/Denial of service attack via SASL JAAS JndiLoginModule configuration using Apache Kafka Connect API
  A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka Connect API. This requires access to a Kafka Connect worker, and the ability to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS config and a SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka Connect clusters since Apache Kafka 2.3.0. This will allow to perform JNDI requests that result in Denial of service/remote code execution.
