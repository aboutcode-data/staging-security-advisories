  3bb9020468cdb5a7ab028ece70604aa349e509df:SERVER-48273 SERVER-48273 Backport yaml-cpp CVE fixes from 0.6.3 to 0.6.2

  Backport the following yaml-cpp CVE fixes from version 0.6.3 to version 0.6.2:
    * CVE-2019-6292
    * CVE-2019-6285

  Also, backport one fix from 0.6.3 for failing VS2017 builds.

  We were previously downloading a source archive for yaml-cpp. To support
  easily backporting fixes, it's changed to use git instead.

  (cherry picked from commit 1845ea31140161354ff6308296bde3436d0bd5f9)
