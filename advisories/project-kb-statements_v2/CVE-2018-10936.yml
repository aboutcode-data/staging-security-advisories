aliases: []
summary: A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was possible to provide
  an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the
  driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade
  as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed
  by a trusted CA.
