aliases: []
summary: XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before
  version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling.
  The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as
  log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input
  stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have
  to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist running Java 15
  or higher. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security
  Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately
  switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14
  or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in
  more detailed in the referenced advisories.
