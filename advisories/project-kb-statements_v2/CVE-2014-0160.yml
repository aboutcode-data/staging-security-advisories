aliases: []
summary: The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly
  handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
  from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by
  reading private keys, related to d1_both.c and t1_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.
