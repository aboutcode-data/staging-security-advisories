aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Web Flow through 2.4.4. Applications that
  do not change the value of the MvcViewFactoryCreator useSpringBinding property which is disabled
  by default (i.e., set to 'false') can be vulnerable to malicious EL expressions in view states
  that process form submissions but do not have a sub-element to declare explicit data binding
  property mappings.
