aliases: []
summary: 'The X-Frame-Options headers were applied inconsistently on some HTTP responses, resulting
  in duplicate or missing security headers. Some browsers would interpret these results incorrectly,
  allowing clickjacking attacks. Mitigation: The fix to consistently apply the security headers
  was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade
  to the appropriate release.'
