aliases: []
summary: An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML loading functionality of util.py in
  OwlMixin before 2.0.0a12. A "Load YAML" string or file (aka load_yaml or load_yamlf) can execute
  arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load
  should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
