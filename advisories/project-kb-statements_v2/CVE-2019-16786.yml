aliases: []
summary: 'Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and only look
  for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would fall through and use the
  Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be
  a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer
  codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: "Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked" would
  incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine
  the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request
  as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.'
