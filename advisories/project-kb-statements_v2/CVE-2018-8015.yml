aliases: []
summary: In Apache ORC 1.0.0 to 1.4.3 a malformed ORC file can trigger an endlessly recursive
  function call in the C++ or Java parser. The impact of this bug is most likely denial-of-service
  against software that uses the ORC file parser. With the C++ parser, the stack overflow might
  possibly corrupt the stack.
