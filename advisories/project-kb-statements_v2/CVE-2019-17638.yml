aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.4.27.v20200227 to 9.4.29.v20200521, in case of too large
  response headers, Jetty throws an exception to produce an HTTP 431 error. When this happens,
  the ByteBuffer containing the HTTP response headers is released back to the ByteBufferPool
  twice. Because of this double release, two threads can acquire the same ByteBuffer from the
  pool and while thread1 is about to use the ByteBuffer to write response1 data, thread2 fills
  the ByteBuffer with other data. Thread1 then proceeds to write the buffer that now contains
  different data. This results in client1, which issued request1 seeing data from another request
  or response which could contain sensitive data belonging to client2 (HTTP session ids, authentication
  credentials, etc.). If the Jetty version cannot be upgraded, the vulnerability can be significantly
  reduced by configuring a responseHeaderSize significantly larger than the requestHeaderSize
  (12KB responseHeaderSize and 8KB requestHeaderSize).
