aliases: []
summary: XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR library before
  3.8.0. The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a form page, allowing
  attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java
  via a specially crafted URL. (This module is not generally used in production systems so the
  attack surface is expected to be low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade immediately.)
