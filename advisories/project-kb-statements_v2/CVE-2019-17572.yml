summary: 'In Apache RocketMQ 4.2.0 to 4.6.0, when the automatic topic creation in the broker
  is turned on by default, an evil topic like “../../../../topic2020” is sent from rocketmq-client
  to the broker, a topic folder will be created in the parent directory in brokers, which leads
  to a directory traversal vulnerability. Users of the affected versions should apply one of
  the following: Upgrade to Apache RocketMQ 4.6.1 or later.'
