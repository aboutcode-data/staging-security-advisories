aliases: []
summary: The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not properly reseed
  the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access it, which
  makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging
  a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same
  rate-limit period as another process.
