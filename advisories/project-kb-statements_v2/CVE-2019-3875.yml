aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in keycloak before 6.0.2. The X.509 authenticator supports
  the verification of client certificates through the CRL, where the CRL list can be obtained
  from the URL provided in the certificate itself (CDP) or through the separately configured
  path. The CRL are often available over the network through unsecured protocols ('http' or
  'ldap') and hence the caller should verify the signature and possibly the certification path.
  Keycloak currently doesn't validate signatures on CRL, which can result in a possibility of
  various attacks like man-in-the-middle.
