aliases: []
summary: Apache CXF has the ability to integrate with JMX by registering an InstrumentationManager
  extension with the CXF bus. If the ‘createMBServerConnectorFactory’ property of the default
  InstrumentationManagerImpl is not disabled, then it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
  style attack. An attacker on the same host can connect to the registry and rebind the entry
  to another server, thus acting as a proxy to the original. They are then able to gain access
  to all of the information that is sent and received over JMX.
