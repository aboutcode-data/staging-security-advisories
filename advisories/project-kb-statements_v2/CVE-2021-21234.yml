summary: spring-boot-actuator-logview in a library that adds a simple logfile viewer as spring
  boot actuator endpoint. It is maven package "eu.hinsch:spring-boot-actuator-logview". In spring-boot-actuator-logview
  before version 0.2.13 there is a directory traversal vulnerability. The nature of this library
  is to expose a log file directory via admin (spring boot actuator) HTTP endpoints. Both the
  filename to view and a base folder (relative to the logging folder root) can be specified
  via request parameters. While the filename parameter was checked to prevent directory traversal
  exploits (so that `filename=../somefile` would not work), the base folder parameter was not
  sufficiently checked, so that `filename=somefile&base=../` could access a file outside the
  logging base directory). The vulnerability has been patched in release 0.2.13. Any users of
  0.2.12 should be able to update without any issues as there are no other changes in that release.
  There is no workaround to fix the vulnerability other than updating or removing the dependency.
  However, removing read access of the user the application is run with to any directory not
  required for running the application can limit the impact. Additionally, access to the logview
  endpoint can be limited by deploying the application behind a reverse proxy.
