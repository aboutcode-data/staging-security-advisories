aliases: []
summary: The httparty gem 0.9.0 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts of string
  values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute
  arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action
  Pack support for YAML type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
