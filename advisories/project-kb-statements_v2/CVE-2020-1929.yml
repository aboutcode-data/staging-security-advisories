aliases: []
summary: The Apache Beam MongoDB connector in versions 2.10.0 to 2.16.0 has an option to disable
  SSL trust verification. However this configuration is not respected and the certificate verification
  disables trust verification in every case. This exclusion also gets registered globally which
  disables trust checking for any code running in the same JVM.
