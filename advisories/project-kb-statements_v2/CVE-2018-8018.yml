aliases: []
summary: In Apache Ignite before 2.4.8 and 2.5.x before 2.5.3, the serialization mechanism does
  not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible
  to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath.
  The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized
  object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.
