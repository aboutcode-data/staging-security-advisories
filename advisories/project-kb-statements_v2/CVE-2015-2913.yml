aliases: []
summary: server/network/protocol/http/OHttpSessionManager.java in the Studio component in OrientDB
  Server Community Edition before 2.0.15 and 2.1.x before 2.1.1 improperly relies on the java.util.Random
  class for generation of random Session ID values, which makes it easier for remote attackers
  to predict a value by determining the internal state of the PRNG in this class.
