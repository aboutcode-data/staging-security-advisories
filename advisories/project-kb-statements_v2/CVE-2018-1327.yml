aliases: []
summary: The Apache Struts REST Plugin is using XStream library which is vulnerable and allow
  perform a DoS attack when using a malicious request with specially crafted XML payload. Upgrade
  to the Apache Struts version 2.5.16 and switch to an optional Jackson XML handler as described
  here http://struts.apache.org/plugins/rest/#custom-contenttypehandlers. Another option is
  to implement a custom XML handler based on the Jackson XML handler from the Apache Struts
  2.5.16.
