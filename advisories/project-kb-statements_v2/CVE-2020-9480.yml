aliases: []
summary: In Apache Spark 2.4.5 and earlier, a standalone resource manager's master may be configured
  to require authentication (spark.authenticate) via a shared secret. When enabled, however,
  a specially-crafted RPC to the master can succeed in starting an application's resources on
  the Spark cluster, even without the shared key. This can be leveraged to execute shell commands
  on the host machine. This does not affect Spark clusters using other resource managers (YARN,
  Mesos, etc).
