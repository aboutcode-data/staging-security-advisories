aliases: []
summary: A code injection issue was discovered in PyXDG before 0.26 via crafted Python code
  in a Category element of a Menu XML document in a .menu file. XDG_CONFIG_DIRS must be set
  up to trigger xdg.Menu.parse parsing within the directory containing this file. This is due
  to a lack of sanitization in xdg/Menu.py before an eval call.
