aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in switchGroup() in agent/ExecHelper/ExecHelperMain.cpp in
  Phusion Passenger before 5.3.2. The set of groups (gidset) is not set correctly, leaving it
  up to randomness (i.e., uninitialized memory) which supplementary groups are actually being
  set while lowering privileges.
