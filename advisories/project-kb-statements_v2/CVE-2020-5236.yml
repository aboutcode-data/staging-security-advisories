aliases: []
summary: 'Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives a header that contains
  invalid characters. When a header like "Bad-header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\x10" is received, it will
  cause the regular expression engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use
  100% CPU time and blocking any other interactions. This allows an attacker to send a single
  request with an invalid header and take the service offline. This issue was introduced in
  version 1.4.2 when the regular expression was updated to attempt to match the behaviour required
  by errata associated with RFC7230. The regular expression that is used to validate incoming
  headers has been updated in version 1.4.3, it is recommended that people upgrade to the new
  version of Waitress as soon as possible.'
