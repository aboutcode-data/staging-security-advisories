aliases: []
summary: 'The template upload API endpoint accepted requests from different domain when sent
  in conjunction with ARP spoofing + man in the middle (MiTM) attack, resulting in a CSRF attack.
  The required attack vector is complex, requiring a scenario with client certificate authentication,
  same subnet access, and injecting malicious code into an unprotected (plaintext HTTP) website
  which the targeted user later visits, but the possible damage warranted a Severe severity
  level. Mitigation: The fix to apply Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy request filtering
  was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade
  to the appropriate release.'
