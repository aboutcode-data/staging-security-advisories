summary: An issue was discovered in Froxlor before 0.10.14. It created files with static names
  in /tmp during installation if the installation directory was not writable. This allowed local
  attackers to cause DoS or disclose information out of the config files, because of _createUserdataConf
  in install/lib/class.FroxlorInstall.php.
