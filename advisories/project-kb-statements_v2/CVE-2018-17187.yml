aliases: []
summary: The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer to perform TLS,
  enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless a verification mode was explicitly
  configured, client and server modes previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a
  peer certificate, with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate verification
  mode with or without hostname verification being performed. The latter hostname verifying
  mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to
  use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted,
  leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses of the Proton-J
  protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport TLS wrapper are not impacted,
  e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper
  layer that wish to enable hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later
  and utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the default for client
  mode usage unless configured otherwise.
