aliases: []
summary: windows-build-tools is a module for installing C++ Build Tools for Windows using npm.
  windows-build-tools versions below 1.0.0 download resources over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable
  to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the
  requested resources with an attacker controlled copy if the attacker is on the network or
  positioned in between the user and the remote server.
