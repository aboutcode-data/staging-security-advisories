aliases: []
summary: lib/Crypto/PublicKey/ElGamal.py in PyCrypto through 2.6.1 generates weak ElGamal key
  parameters, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data
  (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional
  Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for PyCrypto's ElGamal implementation.
