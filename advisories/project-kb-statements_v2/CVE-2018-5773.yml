aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in markdown2 (aka python-markdown2) through 2.3.5. The safe_mode
  feature, which is supposed to sanitize user input against XSS, is flawed and does not escape
  the input properly. With a crafted payload, XSS can be triggered, as demonstrated by omitting
  the final '>' character from an IMG tag.
