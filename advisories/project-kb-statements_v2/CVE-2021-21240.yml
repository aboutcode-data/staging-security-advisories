aliases: []
summary: httplib2 is a comprehensive HTTP client library for Python. In httplib2 before version
  0.19.0, a malicious server which responds with long series of "\xa0" characters in the "www-authenticate"
  header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client
  accessing said server. This is fixed in version 0.19.0 which contains a new implementation
  of auth headers parsing using the pyparsing library.
