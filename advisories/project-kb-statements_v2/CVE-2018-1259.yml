aliases: []
summary: Spring Data Commons, versions 1.13 prior to 1.13.12 and 2.0 prior to 2.0.7, used in
  combination with XMLBeam 1.4.14 or earlier versions, contains a property binder vulnerability
  caused by improper restriction of XML external entity references as underlying library XMLBeam
  does not restrict external reference expansion. An unauthenticated remote malicious user can
  supply specially crafted request parameters against Spring Data's projection-based request
  payload binding to access arbitrary files on the system.
