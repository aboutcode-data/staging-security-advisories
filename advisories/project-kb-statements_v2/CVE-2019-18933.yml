summary: In Zulip Server versions from 1.7.0 to before 2.0.7, a bug in the new user signup process
  meant that users who registered their account using social authentication (e.g., GitHub or
  Google SSO) in an organization that also allows password authentication could have their personal
  API key stolen by an unprivileged attacker, allowing nearly full access to the user's account.
