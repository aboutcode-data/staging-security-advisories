aliases: []
summary: Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1 enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash created from
  the username, password, and an additional system key. This means that an attacker getting
  access to a remember-me token for one server can get access to all servers which allow log-in
  using the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. This problem is fixed in
  Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1
