summary: 'Handling of the close_notify SSL/TLS message does not lead to a connection closure,
  leading the server to retain the socket opened and to have the client potentially receive
  clear text messages afterward. Mitigation: 2.0.20 users should migrate to 2.0.21, 2.1.0 users
  should migrate to 2.1.1. This issue affects: Apache MINA.'
