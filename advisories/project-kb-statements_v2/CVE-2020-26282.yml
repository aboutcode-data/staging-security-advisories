aliases: []
summary: BrowserUp Proxy allows you to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, capture HTTP
  content, and export performance data as a HAR file. BrowserUp Proxy works well as a standalone
  proxy server, but it is especially useful when embedded in Selenium tests. A Server-Side Template
  Injection was identified in BrowserUp Proxy enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL
  expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. This has
  been patched in version 2.1.2.
