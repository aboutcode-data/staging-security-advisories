aliases: []
summary: TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce manager access control when requesting
  roles.queries.php. It is then possible for a manager user to modify any arbitrary roles within
  the application, or delete any arbitrary role. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated
  attacker must have the manager rights on the application, then tamper with the requests sent
  directly, for example by changing the "id" parameter when invoking "delete_role" on roles.queries.php.
