summary: It was found that Keycloak's Node.js adapter before version 4.8.3 did not properly
  verify the web token received from the server in its backchannel logout . An attacker with
  local access could use this to construct a malicious web token setting an NBF parameter that
  could prevent user access indefinitely.
