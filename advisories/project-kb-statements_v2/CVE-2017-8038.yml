aliases: []
summary: In Cloud Foundry Foundation Credhub-release version 1.1.0, access control lists (ACLs)
  enforce whether an authenticated user can perform an operation on a credential. For installations
  using ACLs, the ACL was bypassed for the CredHub interpolate endpoint, allowing authenticated
  applications to view any credential within the CredHub installation.
