aliases: []
summary: The private_address_check ruby gem before 0.4.0 is vulnerable to a bypass due to use
  of Ruby's Resolv.getaddresses method, which is OS-dependent and should not be relied upon
  for security measures, such as when used to blacklist private network addresses to prevent
  server-side request forgery.
