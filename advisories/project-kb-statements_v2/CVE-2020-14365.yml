summary: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine, in ansible-engine 2.8.x before 2.8.15 and ansible-engine
  2.9.x before 2.9.13, when installing packages using the dnf module. GPG signatures are ignored
  during installation even when disable_gpg_check is set to False, which is the default behavior.

  via package installation scripts. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity
  and system availability.
