aliases: []
summary: Cloud Foundry UAA, versions 4.19 prior to 4.19.2 and 4.12 prior to 4.12.4 and 4.10
  prior to 4.10.2 and 4.7 prior to 4.7.6 and 4.5 prior to 4.5.7, incorrectly authorizes requests
  to admin endpoints by accepting a valid refresh token in lieu of an access token. Refresh
  tokens by design have a longer expiration time than access tokens, allowing the possessor
  of a refresh token to authenticate longer than expected. This affects the administrative endpoints
  of the UAA. i.e. /Users, /Groups, etc. However, if the user has been deleted or had groups
  removed, or the client was deleted, the refresh token will no longer be valid.
