aliases: []
summary: ibm_db is an asynchronous/synchronous interface for node.js to IBM DB2 and IBM Informix.
  ibm_db before 1.0.2 downloads binary resources over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM
  attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested
  binary with an attacker controlled binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned
  in between the user and the remote server.
