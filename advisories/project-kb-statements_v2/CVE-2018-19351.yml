aliases: []
summary: Jupyter Notebook before 5.7.1 allows XSS via an untrusted notebook because nbconvert
  responses are considered to have the same origin as the notebook server. In other words, nbconvert
  endpoints can execute JavaScript with access to the server API. In notebook/nbconvert/handlers.py,
  NbconvertFileHandler and NbconvertPostHandler do not set a Content Security Policy to prevent
  this.
