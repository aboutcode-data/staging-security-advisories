aliases: []
summary: The Crumb plugin before 3.0.0 for Node.js does not properly restrict token access in
  situations where a hapi route handler has CORS enabled, which allows remote attackers to obtain
  sensitive information, and potentially obtain the ability to spoof requests to non-CORS routes,
  via a crafted web site that is visited by an application consumer.
