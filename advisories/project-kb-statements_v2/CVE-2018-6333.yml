aliases: []
summary: The hhvm-attach deep link handler in Nuclide did not properly sanitize the provided
  hostname parameter when rendering. As a result, a malicious URL could be used to render HTML
  and other content inside of the editor's context, which could potentially be chained to lead
  to code execution. This issue affected Nuclide prior to v0.290.0.
