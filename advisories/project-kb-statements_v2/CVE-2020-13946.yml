aliases: []
summary: In Apache Cassandra, all versions prior to 2.1.22, 2.2.18, 3.0.22, 3.11.8 and 4.0-beta2,
  it is possible for a local attacker without access to the Apache Cassandra process or configuration
  files to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and capture user
  names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then use these credentials
  to access the JMX interface and perform unauthorised operations. Users should also be aware
  of CVE-2019-2684, a JRE vulnerability that enables this issue to be exploited remotely.
