aliases: []
summary: In Wagtail before versions 2.8.1 and 2.7.2, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  exists on the page revision comparison view within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with
  a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft a page revision
  history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that
  user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without
  access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the
  LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch).
