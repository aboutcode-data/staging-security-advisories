aliases: []
summary: In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, using a remember-me cookie with an arbitrary username
  can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the remember-me cookie
  was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows anonymous access. This way, an
  attacker can, for example, fake a remember-me token, assume the identity of the global system
  administrator and request non-public content from the search service without ever providing
  any proper authentication. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1
