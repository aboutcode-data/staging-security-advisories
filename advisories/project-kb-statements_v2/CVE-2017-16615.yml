aliases: []
summary: An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality in the parse_yaml_query
  method in parser.py in MLAlchemy before 0.2.2. When processing YAML-Based queries for data,
  a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because
  load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded
  YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
