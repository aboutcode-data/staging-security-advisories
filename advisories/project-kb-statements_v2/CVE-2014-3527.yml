aliases: []
summary: When using the CAS Proxy ticket authentication from Spring Security 3.1 to 3.2.4 a
  malicious CAS Service could trick another CAS Service into authenticating a proxy ticket that
  was not associated. This is due to the fact that the proxy ticket authentication uses the
  information from the HttpServletRequest which is populated based upon untrusted information
  within the HTTP request. This means if there are access control restrictions on which CAS
  services can authenticate to one another, those restrictions can be bypassed. If users are
  not using CAS Proxy tickets and not basing access control decisions based upon the CAS Service,
  then there is no impact to users.
