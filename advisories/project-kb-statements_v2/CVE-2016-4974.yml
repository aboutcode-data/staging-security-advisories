aliases: []
summary: Apache Qpid AMQP 0-x JMS client before 6.0.4 and JMS (AMQP 1.0) before 0.10.0 does
  not restrict the use of classes available on the classpath, which might allow remote authenticated
  users with permission to send messages to deserialize arbitrary objects and execute arbitrary
  code by leveraging a crafted serialized object in a JMS ObjectMessage that is handled by the
  getObject function.
