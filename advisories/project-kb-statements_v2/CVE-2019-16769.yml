aliases: []
summary: The serialize-javascript npm package before version 2.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-site
  Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular
  expressions. This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation
  of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions.
  If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js,
  it is affected by this vulnerability.
