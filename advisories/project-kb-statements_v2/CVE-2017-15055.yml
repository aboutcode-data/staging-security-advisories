aliases: []
summary: TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce item access control when requesting
  items.queries.php. It is then possible to copy any arbitrary item into a directory controlled
  by the attacker, edit any item within a read-only directory, delete an arbitrary item, delete
  the file attachments of an arbitrary item, copy the password of an arbitrary item to the copy/paste
  buffer, access the history of an arbitrary item, and edit attributes of an arbitrary directory.
  To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must tamper with the requests sent
  directly, for example by changing the "item_id" parameter when invoking "copy_item" on items.queries.php.
