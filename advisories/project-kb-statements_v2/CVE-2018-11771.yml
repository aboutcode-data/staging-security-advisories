aliases: []
summary: When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, the read method of Apache Commons Compress
  1.7 to 1.17's ZipArchiveInputStream can fail to return the correct EOF indication after the
  end of the stream has been reached. When combined with a java.io.InputStreamReader this can
  lead to an infinite stream, which can be used to mount a denial of service attack against
  services that use Compress' zip package.
