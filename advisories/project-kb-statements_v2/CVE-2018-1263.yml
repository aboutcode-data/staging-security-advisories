summary: Addresses partial fix in CVE-2018-1261. Pivotal spring-integration-zip, versions prior
  to 1.0.2, exposes an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially
  crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that
  holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction
  directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.
