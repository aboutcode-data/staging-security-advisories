aliases: []
summary: In Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.11.0, the flow fingerprint factory generated flow fingerprints
  which included sensitive property descriptor values. In the event a node attempted to join
  a cluster and the cluster flow was not inheritable, the flow fingerprint of both the cluster
  and local flow was printed, potentially containing sensitive values in plaintext.
