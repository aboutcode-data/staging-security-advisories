aliases: []
summary: In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not enable python-requests
  certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions,
  it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class,
  such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in
  certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.
