aliases: []
summary: In Django User Sessions (django-user-sessions) before 1.7.1, the views provided allow
  users to terminate specific sessions. The session key is used to identify sessions, and thus
  included in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem. However if the website has
  an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted by the attacker and a session takeover
  could happen.
