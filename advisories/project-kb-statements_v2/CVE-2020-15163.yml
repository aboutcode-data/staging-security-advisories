aliases: []
summary: Python TUF (The Update Framework) reference implementation before version 0.12 it will
  incorrectly trust a previously downloaded root metadata file which failed verification at
  download time. This allows an attacker who is able to serve multiple new versions of root
  metadata (i.e. by a person-in-the-middle attack) culminating in a version which has not been
  correctly signed to control the trust chain for future updates. This is fixed in version 0.12
  and newer.
