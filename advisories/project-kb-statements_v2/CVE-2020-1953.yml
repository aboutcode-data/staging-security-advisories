aliases: []
summary: Apache Commons Configuration uses a third-party library to parse YAML files which by
  default allows the instantiation of classes if the YAML includes special statements. Apache
  Commons Configuration versions 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 did not change the default settings
  of this library. So if a YAML file was loaded from an untrusted source, it could therefore
  load and execute code out of the control of the host application.
