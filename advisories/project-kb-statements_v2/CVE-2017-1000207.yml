aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Swagger-Parser's version <= 1.0.30 and Swagger codegen version <=
  2.2.2 yaml parsing functionality results in arbitrary code being executed when a maliciously
  crafted yaml Open-API specification is parsed. This in particular, affects the 'generate'
  and 'validate' command in swagger-codegen (<= 2.2.2) and can lead to arbitrary code being
  executed when these commands are used on a well-crafted yaml specification.
