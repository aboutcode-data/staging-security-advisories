summary: An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality in config.py
  in Confire 0.2.0. Due to the user-specific configuration being loaded from "~/.confire.yaml"
  using the yaml.load function, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting
  in command execution. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
