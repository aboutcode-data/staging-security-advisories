aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 9.0.1. When configuring an Conditional
  OTP Authentication Flow as a post login flow of an IDP, the failure login events for OTP are
  not being sent to the brute force protection event queue. So BruteForceProtector does not
  handle this events.
