aliases: []
summary: private_address_check ruby gem before 0.5.0 is vulnerable to a time-of-check time-of-use
  (TOCTOU) race condition due to the address the socket uses not being checked. DNS entries
  with a TTL of 0 can trigger this case where the initial resolution is a public address but
  the subsequent resolution is a private address.
