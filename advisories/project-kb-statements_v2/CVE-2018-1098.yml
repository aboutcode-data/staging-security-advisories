aliases: []
summary: A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An attacker
  can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key.
  Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or
  such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.
