aliases: []
summary: When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull index files from
  a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However, Solr before 5.5.4
  and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special
  request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed.
  Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/or authentication would not be
  at risk since only trusted clients and users would gain direct HTTP access.
