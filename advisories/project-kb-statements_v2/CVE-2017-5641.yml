aliases: []
summary: Previous versions of Apache Flex BlazeDS (4.7.2 and earlier) did not restrict which
  types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by default. During the deserialization
  process code is executed that for several known types has undesired side-effects. Other, unknown
  types may also exhibit such behaviors. One vector in the Java standard library exists that
  allows an attacker to trigger possibly further exploitable Java deserialization of untrusted
  data. Other known vectors in third party libraries can be used to trigger remote code execution.
