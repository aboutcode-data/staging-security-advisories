summary: Spring Cloud SSO Connector, version 2.1.2, contains a regression which disables issuer
  validation in resource servers that are not bound to the SSO service. In PCF deployments with
  multiple SSO service plans, a remote attacker can authenticate to unbound resource servers
  which use this version of the SSO Connector with tokens generated from another service plan.
