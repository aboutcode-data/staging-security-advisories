summary: CiphertextHeader.java in Cryptacular 1.2.3, as used in Apereo CAS and other products,
  allows attackers to trigger excessive memory allocation during a decode operation, because
  the nonce array length associated with "new byte" may depend on untrusted input within the
  header of encoded data.
