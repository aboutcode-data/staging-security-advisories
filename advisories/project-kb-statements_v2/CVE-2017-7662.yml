aliases: []
summary: Apache CXF Fediz ships with an OpenId Connect (OIDC) service which has a Client Registration
  Service, which is a simple web application that allows clients to be created, deleted, etc.
  A CSRF (Cross Style Request Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in this web application
  in Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.0 and 1.3.2, meaning that a malicious web application could
  create new clients, or reset secrets, etc, after the admin user has logged on to the client
  registration service and the session is still active.
