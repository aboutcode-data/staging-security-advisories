aliases: []
summary: Ratpack versions before 1.6.1 generate a session ID using a cryptographically weak
  PRNG in the JDK's ThreadLocalRandom. This means that if an attacker can determine a small
  window for the server start time and obtain a session ID value, they can theoretically determine
  the sequence of session IDs.
