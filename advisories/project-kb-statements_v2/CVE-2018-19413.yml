aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the API of SonarSource SonarQube before 7.4 could allow an authenticated
  user to discover sensitive information such as valid user-account logins in the web application.
  The vulnerability occurs because of improperly configured access controls that cause the API
  to return the externalIdentity field to non-administrator users. The attacker could use this
  information in subsequent attacks against the system.
