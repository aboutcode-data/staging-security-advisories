aliases: []
summary: Apache Olingo versions 4.0.0 to 4.7.0 provide the AsyncRequestWrapperImpl class which
  reads a URL from the Location header, and then sends a GET or DELETE request to this URL.
  It may allow to implement a SSRF attack. If an attacker tricks a client to connect to a malicious
  server, the server can make the client call any URL including internal resources which are
  not directly accessible by the attacker.
