summary: fstream before 1.0.12 is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite. Extracting tarballs
  containing a hardlink to a file that already exists in the system, and a file that matches
  the hardlink, will overwrite the system's file with the contents of the extracted file. The
  fstream.DirWriter() function is vulnerable.
