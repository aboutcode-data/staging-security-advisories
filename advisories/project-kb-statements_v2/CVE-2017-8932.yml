aliases: []
summary: A bug in the standard library ScalarMult implementation of curve P-256 for amd64 architectures
  in Go before 1.7.6 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2 causes incorrect results to be generated for specific
  input points. An adaptive attack can be mounted to progressively extract the scalar input
  to ScalarMult by submitting crafted points and observing failures to the derive correct output.
  This leads to a full key recovery attack against static ECDH, as used in popular JWT libraries.
