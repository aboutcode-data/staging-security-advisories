summary: Angular Expressions before version 1.0.1 has a remote code execution vulnerability
  if you call expressions.compile(userControlledInput) where userControlledInput is text that
  comes from user input. If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run
  any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).
  If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression,
  thus gaining Remote Code Execution.
