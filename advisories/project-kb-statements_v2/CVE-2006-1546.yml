summary: Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Struts before 1.2.9 allows remote attackers to bypass
  validation via a request with a 'org.apache.struts.taglib.html.Constants.CANCEL' parameter,
  which causes the action to be canceled but would not be detected from applications that do
  not use the isCancelled check.
