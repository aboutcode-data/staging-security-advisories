aliases: []
summary: Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily run the application
  as a systemd or init.d linux service. The script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier
  and 2.0.0.M1 through 2.0.0.M7 is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the "run_user"
  to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system. In order to instigate the
  attack, the application must be installed as a service and the "run_user" requires shell access
  to the server. Spring Boot application that are not installed as a service, or are not using
  the embedded launch script are not susceptible.
