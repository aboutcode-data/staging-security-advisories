aliases: []
summary: Apache Storm version 1.0.6 and earlier, 1.2.1 and earlier, and version 1.1.2 and earlier
  expose an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted
  zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path
  traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory,
  the final path ends up outside of the target folder.
