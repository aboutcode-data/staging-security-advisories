aliases: []
summary: Spring Security versions 5.1.x prior to 5.1.2 contain an authorization bypass vulnerability
  during JWT issuer validation. In order to be impacted, the same private key for an honest
  issuer and a malicious user must be used when signing JWTs. In that case, a malicious user
  could fashion signed JWTs with the malicious issuer URL that may be granted for the honest
  issuer.
