aliases: []
summary: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse).
  Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version
  1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large
  file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly
  more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects
  any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in
  version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict
  the homeservers communicated with over federation.
