summary: Cross-Site Request Forgery exists in OctoberCMS 1.0.426 (aka Build 426) due to improper
  validation of CSRF tokens for postback handling, allowing an attacker to successfully take
  over the victim's account. The attack bypasses a protection mechanism involving X-CSRF headers
  and CSRF tokens via a certain _handler postback variable.
