aliases: []
summary: 'Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) and File Enumeration vulnerability in Apache Roller
  5.2.1, 5.2.0 and earlier unsupported versions relies on Java SAX Parser to implement its XML-RPC
  interface and by default that parser supports external entities in XML DOCTYPE, which opens
  Roller up to SSRF / File Enumeration vulnerability. Note that this vulnerability exists even
  if Roller XML-RPC interface is disable via the Roller web admin UI. Mitigation: There are
  a couple of ways you can fix this vulnerability: 1) Upgrade to the latest version of Roller,
  which is now 5.2.2 2) Or, edit the Roller web.xml file and comment out the XML-RPC Servlet
  mapping as shown below: <!-- <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>XmlRpcServlet</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/roller-services/xmlrpc</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> -->'
