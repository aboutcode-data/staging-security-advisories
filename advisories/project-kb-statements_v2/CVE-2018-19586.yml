aliases: []
summary: Silverpeas 5.15 through 6.0.2 is affected by an authenticated Directory Traversal vulnerability
  that can be triggered during file uploads because core/webapi/upload/FileUploadData.java mishandles
  a StringUtil.java call. This vulnerability enables regular users to write arbitrary files
  on the underlying system with privileges of the user running the application. Especially,
  an attacker may leverage the vulnerability to write an executable JSP file in an exposed web
  directory to execute commands on the underlying system.
