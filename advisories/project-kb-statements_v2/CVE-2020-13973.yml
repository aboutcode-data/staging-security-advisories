summary: OWASP json-sanitizer before 1.2.1 allows XSS. An attacker who controls a substring
  of the input JSON, and controls another substring adjacent to a SCRIPT element in which the
  output is embedded as JavaScript, may be able to confuse the HTML parser as to where the SCRIPT
  element ends, and cause non-script content to be interpreted as JavaScript.
