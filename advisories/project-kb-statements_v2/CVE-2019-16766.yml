aliases: []
summary: When using wagtail-2fa before 1.3.0, if someone gains access to someone's Wagtail login
  credentials, they can log into the CMS and bypass the 2FA check by changing the URL. They
  can then add a new device and gain full access to the CMS. This problem has been patched in
  version 1.3.0.
