summary: 'A regression has been introduced in the commit preventing JMX re-bind. By passing
  an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map that contains the authentication
  credentials, it leaves ActiveMQ open to the following attack: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html
  "A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use it to create new
  MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no security manager. In other words, a rogue
  remote client could make your Java application execute arbitrary code." Mitigation: Upgrade
  to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.13'
