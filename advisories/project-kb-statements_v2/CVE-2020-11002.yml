aliases: []
summary: dropwizard-validation before versions 2.0.3 and 1.3.21 has a remote code execution
  vulnerability. A server-side template injection was identified in the self-validating feature
  enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution
  (RCE) vulnerability. If you are using a self-validating bean an upgrade to Dropwizard 1.3.21/2.0.3
  or later is strongly recommended. The changes introduced in Dropwizard 1.3.19 and 2.0.2 for
  CVE-2020-5245 unfortunately did not fix the underlying issue completely. The issue has been
  fixed in dropwizard-validation 1.3.21 and 2.0.3 or later. We strongly recommend upgrading
  to one of these versions.
