aliases: []
summary: Apache CXF before 3.3.4 and 3.2.11 provides all of the components that are required
  to build a fully fledged OpenId Connect service. There is a vulnerability in the access token
  services, where it does not validate that the authenticated principal is equal to that of
  the supplied clientId parameter in the request. If a malicious client was able to somehow
  steal an authorization code issued to another client, then they could exploit this vulnerability
  to obtain an access token for the other client.
