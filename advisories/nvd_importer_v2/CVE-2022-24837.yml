aliases: []
summary: HedgeDoc is an open-source, web-based, self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor.
  Images uploaded with HedgeDoc version 1.9.1 and later have an enumerable filename after the
  upload, resulting in potential information leakage of uploaded documents. This is especially
  relevant for private notes and affects all upload backends, except Lutim and imgur. This issue
  is patched in version 1.9.3 by replacing the filename generation with UUIDv4. If you cannot
  upgrade to HedgeDoc 1.9.3, it is possible to block POST requests to `/uploadimage`, which
  will disable future uploads.
