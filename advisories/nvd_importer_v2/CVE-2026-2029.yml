aliases: []
summary: The Livemesh Addons for Beaver Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the `[labb_pricing_item]` shortcode's `title` and `value` attributes
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. Specifically, the plugin uses `htmlspecialchars_decode()` after `wp_kses_post()`,
  which decodes HTML entities back into executable code after sanitization has occurred. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
