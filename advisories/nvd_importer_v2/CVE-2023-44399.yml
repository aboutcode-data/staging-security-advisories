aliases: []
summary: ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. In versions 2.37.2 and prior, ZITADEL administrators
  can enable a setting called "Ignoring unknown usernames" which helps mitigate attacks that
  try to guess/enumerate usernames. While this settings was properly working during the authentication
  process it did not work correctly on the password reset flow. This meant that even if this
  feature was active that an attacker could use the password reset function to verify if an
  account exist within ZITADEL. This bug has been patched in versions 2.37.3 and 2.38.0. No
  known workarounds are available.
