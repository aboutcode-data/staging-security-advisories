aliases: []
summary: The client in Northern.tech Mender 3.2.0, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control.
  It listens on a random, unprivileged TCP port and exposes an HTTP proxy to facilitate API
  calls from additional client components running on the device. However, it listens on all
  network interfaces instead of only the localhost interface. Therefore, any client on the same
  network can connect to this TCP port and send HTTP requests. The Mender Client will forward
  these requests to the Mender Server. Additionally, if mTLS is set up, the Mender Client will
  connect to the Mender Server using the device's client certificate, making it possible for
  the attacker to bypass mTLS authentication and send requests to the Mender Server without
  direct access to the client certificate and related private key. Accessing the HTTP proxy
  from the local network doesn't represent a direct threat, because it doesn't expose any device
  or server-specific data. However, it increases the attack surface and can be a potential vector
  to exploit other vulnerabilities both on the Client and the Server.
