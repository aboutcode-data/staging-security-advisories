aliases: []
summary: Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Open Forms supports
  file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only
  certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input
  validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to 1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could
  alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation. This results in files being uploaded
  to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension.
  These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications
  for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted
  networks. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, an API
  gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and
  block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application.
