aliases: []
summary: The RapidResult plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 's' parameter
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user
  supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions and above to append
  additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
  information from the database.
