aliases: []
summary: Mids' Reborn Hero Designer 2.6.0.7 downloads the update manifest, as well as update
  files, over cleartext HTTP. Additionally, the application does not perform file integrity
  validation for files after download. An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack against
  this connection and replace executable files with malicious versions, which the operating
  system then executes under the context of the user running Hero Designer.
