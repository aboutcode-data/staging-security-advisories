  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels

  In 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d ("android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space")
  fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,
  sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so
  the driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous
  transactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.

  Unfortunately, on the "free" side, the accounting of async_free_space
  did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of
  async_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or
  less.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue
  has gone undetected for several years.

  The fix is to use "buffer_size" (the allocated buffer size) instead of
  "size" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space
  during the free operation. These are the same except for this
  corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes.
