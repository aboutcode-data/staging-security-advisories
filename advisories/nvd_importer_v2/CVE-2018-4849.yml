aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance VMS Video for Android (All versions
  < V12.1a (2018 R1)), Siveillance VMS Video for iOS (All versions < V12.1a (2018 R1)). Improper
  certificate validation could allow an attacker in a privileged network position to read data
  from and write data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server. The
  security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position
  which allows intercepting the communication channel between the affected app and a server
  (such as Man-in-the-Middle). Furthermore, an attacker must be able to generate a certificate
  that results for the validation algorithm in a checksum identical to a trusted certificate.
  Successful exploitation requires no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow reading
  data from and writing data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server,
  impacting the communication's confidentiality and integrity. At the time of advisory publication
  no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security
  vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.
