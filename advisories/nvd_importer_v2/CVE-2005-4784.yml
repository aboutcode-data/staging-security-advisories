aliases: []
summary: Multiple buffer overflows in the POSIX readdir_r function, as used in multiple packages,
  allow local users to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1)
  a symlink attack that exploits a race condition between opendir and pathcon calls and changes
  the filesystem to one with a larger maximum directory-entry name length, or (2) possibly via
  programmer-introduced errors on operating systems with a small struct dirent, such as Solaris
  or BeOS, as demonstrated in packages including (a) gcj, (b) KDE, (c) libwww, (d) the Rudiments
  library, (e) teTeX, (f) xmail, (g) bfbtester, (h) ncftp, (i) netwib, (j) OpenOffice.org, (k)
  Pike, (l) reprepro, (m) Tcl, and (n) xgsmlib.
