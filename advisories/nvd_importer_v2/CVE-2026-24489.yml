summary: Gakido is a Python HTTP client focused on browser impersonation and anti-bot evasion.
  A vulnerability was discovered in Gakido prior to version 0.1.1 that allowed HTTP header injection
  through CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences in user-supplied header values and names.
  When making HTTP requests with user-controlled header values containing `\r\n` (CRLF), `\n`
  (LF), or `\x00` (null byte) characters, an attacker could inject arbitrary HTTP headers into
  the request. The fix in version 0.1.1 adds a `_sanitize_header()` function that strips `\r`,
  `\n`, and `\x00` characters from both header names and values before they are included in
  HTTP requests.
