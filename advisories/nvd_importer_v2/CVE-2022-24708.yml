aliases: []
summary: Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in
  PHP. ttUser.class.php in Time Tracker versions prior to 1.20.0.5646 was not escaping primary
  group name for display. Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to modify primary
  group name with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser
  on subsequent requests on pages where primary group name was displayed. This is vulnerability
  has been fixed in version 1.20.0.5646. Users who are unable to upgrade may modify ttUser.class.php
  to use an additional call to htmlspecialchars when printing group name.
