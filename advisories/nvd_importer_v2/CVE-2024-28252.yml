summary: CoreWCF is a port of the service side of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to
  .NET Core. If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be
  consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There
  are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service
  and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming
  session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn't
  send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection
  is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this
  behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding
  has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF
  are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.
