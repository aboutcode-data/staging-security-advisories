aliases: []
summary: FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and
  batch operations. Prior to 2.2.3, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists
  in the Filerise application due to improper handling of uploaded SVG files. The application
  accepts user-supplied SVG uploads without sanitizing or restricting embedded script content.
  When a malicious SVG containing inline JavaScript or event-based payloads is uploaded, it
  is later rendered directly in the browser whenever viewed within the application. Because
  SVGs are XML-based and allow scripting, they execute in the origin context of the application,
  enabling full stored XSS. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.3.
