aliases: []
summary: Shopware is an open commerce platform. Versions 6.4.6.0 through 6.6.10.9 and 6.7.0.0
  through 6.7.5.0 have a Reflected XSS vulnerability in AuthController.php. A request parameter
  from the login page URL is directly rendered within the Twig template of the Storefront login
  page without further processing or input validation. This allows direct code injection into
  the template via the URL parameter, waitTime, which lacks proper input validation. This issue
  is fixed in versions 6.6.10.10 and 6.7.5.1.
