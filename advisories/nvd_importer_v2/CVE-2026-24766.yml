aliases: []
summary: NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.301.0,
  an authenticated user with org-level-creator permissions can exploit prototype pollution in
  the `/api/v2/meta/connection/test` endpoint, causing all database write operations to fail
  application-wide until server restart. While the pollution technically bypasses SUPER_ADMIN
  authorization checks, no practical privileged actions can be performed because database operations
  fail immediately after pollution. Version 0.301.0 patches the issue.
