summary: "A vulnerability in the licensing features of&nbsp;Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)\
  \ and Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) could allow an authenticated, remote\
  \ attacker with administrative privileges to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper parsing of XML that is processed by the web-based\
  \ management interface of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by uploading a malicious file to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system that could include sensitive\
  \ data that should otherwise be inaccessible even to administrators. To exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the attacker must have valid administrative credentials."
