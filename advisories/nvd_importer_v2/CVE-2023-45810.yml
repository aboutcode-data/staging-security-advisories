aliases: []
summary: OpenFGA is a flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired
  by Google Zanzibar. Affected versions of OpenFGA are vulnerable to a denial of service attack.
  When a number of `ListObjects` calls are executed, in some scenarios, those calls are not
  releasing resources even after a response has been sent, and given a sufficient call volume
  the service as a whole becomes unresponsive. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.4
  and the upgrade is considered backwards compatible. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
