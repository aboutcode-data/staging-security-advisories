aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the content scanning and message filtering features of Cisco Secure\
  \ Email Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to overwrite arbitrary files\
  \ on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper handling\
  \ of email attachments when file analysis and content filters are enabled. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by sending an email that contains a crafted attachment through\
  \ an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to replace any file on\
  \ the underlying file system. The attacker could then perform any of the following actions:\
  \ add users with root privileges, modify the device configuration, execute arbitrary code,\
  \ or cause a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r Note:\
  \ Manual intervention is required to recover from the DoS condition. Customers are advised\
  \ to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help recover a device in this\
  \ condition."
