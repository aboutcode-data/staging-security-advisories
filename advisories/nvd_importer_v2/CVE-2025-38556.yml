  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits

  Testing by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a
  shift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit
  quantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but
  there are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size
  set to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because
  of that.

  Instead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable
  result instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bits
  set to 0 -- the same as what snto32() does.
