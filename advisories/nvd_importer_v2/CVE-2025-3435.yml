aliases: []
summary: The Mang Board WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the board_header and board_footer parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.6
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
  and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
