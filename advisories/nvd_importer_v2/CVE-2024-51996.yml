aliases: []
summary: Symphony process is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which executes commands
  in sub-processes. When consuming a persisted remember-me cookie, Symfony does not check if
  the username persisted in the database matches the username attached with the cookie, leading
  to authentication bypass. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.4.47, 6.4.15, and 7.1.8.
