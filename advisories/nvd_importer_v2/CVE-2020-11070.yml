summary: The SVG Sanitizer extension for TYPO3 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability in versions
  before 1.0.3. Slightly invalid or incomplete SVG markup is not correctly processed and thus
  not sanitized at all. Albeit the markup is not valid it still is evaluated in browsers and
  leads to cross-site scripting. This is fixed in version 1.0.3.
