summary: 'Jelsoft vBulletin accepts uploads of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and processes them
  in a way that allows remote authenticated administrators to gain shell access by uploading
  a CSS file that contains PHP code, then selecting the file via the style chooser, which causes
  the PHP code to be executed.  NOTE: the vendor was unable to reproduce this issue in 3.5.x.  NOTE:
  this issue might be due to direct static code injection.'
