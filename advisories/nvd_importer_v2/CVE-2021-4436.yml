summary: The 3DPrint Lite WordPress plugin before 1.9.1.5 does not have any authorisation and
  does not check the uploaded file in its p3dlite_handle_upload AJAX action , allowing unauthenticated
  users to upload arbitrary file to the web server. However, there is a .htaccess, preventing
  the file to be accessed on Web servers such as Apache.
