aliases: []
summary: Stalwart is a mail and collaboration server. Starting in version 0.12.0 and prior to
  version 0.13.3, a memory exhaustion vulnerability exists in Stalwart's CalDAV implementation
  that allows authenticated attackers to cause denial-of-service by triggering unbounded memory
  consumption through recurring event expansion. An authenticated attacker can crash the Stalwart
  server by creating recurring events with large payloads and triggering their expansion through
  CalDAV REPORT requests. A single malicious request expanding 300 events with 1000-character
  descriptions can consume up to 2 GB of memory. The vulnerability exists in the `ArchivedCalendarEventData.expand`
  function, which processes CalDAV `REPORT` requests with event expansion. When a client requests
  recurring events in their expanded form using the `<C:expand>` element, the server stores
  all expanded event instances in memory without enforcing size limits. Users should upgrade
  to Stalwart version 0.13.3 or later to receive a fix. If immediate upgrading is not possible,
  implement memory limits at the container/system level; monitor server memory usage for unusual
  spikes; consider rate limiting CalDAV REPORT requests; and restrict CalDAV access to trusted
  users only.
