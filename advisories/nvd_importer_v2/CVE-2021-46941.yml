  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: dwc3: core: Do core softreset when switch mode


  According to the programming guide, to switch mode for DRD controller,
  the driver needs to do the following.

  To switch from device to host:
  1. Reset controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset
  2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(host mode)
  3. Reset the host with USBCMD.HCRESET
  4. Then follow up with the initializing host registers sequence

  To switch from host to device:
  1. Reset controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset
  2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(device mode)
  3. Reset the device with DCTL.CSftRst
  4. Then follow up with the initializing registers sequence

  Currently we're missing step 1) to do GCTL.CoreSoftReset and step 3) of
  switching from host to device. John Stult reported a lockup issue seen
  with HiKey960 platform without these steps[1]. Similar issue is observed
  with Ferry's testing platform[2].

  So, apply the required steps along with some fixes to Yu Chen's and John
  Stultz's version. The main fixes to their versions are the missing wait
  for clocks synchronization before clearing GCTL.CoreSoftReset and only
  apply DCTL.CSftRst when switching from host to device.
