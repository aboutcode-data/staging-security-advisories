summary: 'Rejected reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: CVE-2002-1367.  Reason:
  This CAN was originally assigned for the theft of root certificates in CUPS, but it was later
  deemed to be a legitimate result of exploiting a different vulnerability, CVE-2002-1367, so
  it is not a distinct vulnerability.  Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2002-1367 instead
  of this candidate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to
  prevent accidental usage'
