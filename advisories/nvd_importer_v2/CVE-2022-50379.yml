  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: fix race between quota enable and quota rescan ioctl

  When enabling quotas, at btrfs_quota_enable(), after committing the
  transaction, we change fs_info->quota_root to point to the quota root we
  created and set BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED at fs_info->flags. Then we try
  to start the qgroup rescan worker, first by initializing it with a call
  to qgroup_rescan_init() - however if that fails we end up freeing the
  quota root but we leave fs_info->quota_root still pointing to it, this
  can later result in a use-after-free somewhere else.

  We have previously set the flags BTRFS_FS_QUOTA_ENABLED and
  BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON, so we can only fail with -EINPROGRESS at
  btrfs_quota_enable(), which is possible if someone already called the
  quota rescan ioctl, and therefore started the rescan worker.

  So fix this by ignoring an -EINPROGRESS and asserting we can't get any
  other error.
