aliases: []
summary: The Sign In With Google plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0. This is due to the 'authenticate_user' user function
  not implementing sufficient null value checks when setting the access token and user information.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first user who has signed
  in using Google OAuth, which could be the site administrator.
