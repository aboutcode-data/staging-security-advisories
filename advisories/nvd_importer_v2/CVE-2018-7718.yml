aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Telexy QPath 5.4.462. A low privileged authenticated user
  supplying a specially crafted serialized request to AdanitDataService.svc may modify user
  information, including but not limited to email address, username, and password, of other
  user accounts. The simplest attack approach is for the attacker to intercept their own password-change
  request and modify the username before the request reaches the server. Also, changing a victim's
  email address can have a similar account-takeover consequence.
