aliases: []
summary: symfony/runtime is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which enables decoupling
  PHP applications from global state. When the `register_argv_argc` php directive is set to
  `on` , and users call any URL with a special crafted query string, they are able to change
  the environment or debug mode used by the kernel when handling the request. As of versions
  5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `SymfonyRuntime` now ignores the `argv` values for non-SAPI
  PHP runtimes. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
