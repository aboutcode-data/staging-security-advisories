aliases: []
summary: 'FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. Prior to version 1.26.2, it''s possible
  to poison feed favicons by adding a given URL as a feed with the proxy set to an attacker-controlled
  one and disabled SSL verifying. The favicon hash is computed by hashing the feed URL and the
  salt, whilst not including the following variables: proxy address, proxy protocol, and whether
  SSL should be verified. Therefore it''s possible to poison a favicon of a given feed by simply
  intercepting the response of the feed, and changing the website URL to one where a threat
  actor controls the feed favicon. Feed favicons can be replaced for all users by anyone. Version
  1.26.2 fixes the issue.'
