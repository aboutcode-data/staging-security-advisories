  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpoints

  As part of commit e81a7018d93a ("usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structure
  dynamically") the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will free
  the dwc->gadget structure upon the device's removal when
  usb_del_gadget_udc() is called in dwc3_gadget_exit().

  However, simply freeing the gadget results a dangling pointer
  situation: the endpoints created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints()
  have their dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_head
  anchored at dwc->gadget->ep_list.  Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,
  the first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and
  likewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.
  The dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a
  use-after-free when it calls list_del().

  This was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.
  The recent commit 568262bf5492 ("usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown
  callback for dwc3") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.

  There are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform
  a list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from
  the rest of the dwc3_ep chain.

  Another approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the
  usb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate "del" and "put"
  components.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be
  called before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget().
