summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AppDynamics Controller
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a configuration file and
  the login page for an administrative console that they would not normally have authorization
  to access. This vulnerability is due to improper authorization checking for HTTP requests
  that are submitted to the affected web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected instance of AppDynamics
  Controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the login page for an
  administrative console. AppDynamics has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
