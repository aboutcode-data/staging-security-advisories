aliases: []
summary: PostgreSQL Anonymizer contains a vulnerability that allows a user to gain superuser
  privileges by creating a custom operator in the public schema and place malicious code in
  that operator. This operator will later be executed with superuser privileges when the extension
  is created. The risk is higher with PostgreSQL 14 or with instances upgraded from PostgreSQL
  14 or a prior version. With PostgreSQL 15 and later, the creation permission on the public
  schema is revoked by default and this exploit can only be achieved if a superuser adds a new
  schema in her/his own search_path and grants the CREATE privilege on that schema to untrusted
  users, both actions being clearly discouraged by the PostgreSQL documentation. The problem
  is resolved in PostgreSQL Anonymizer 3.0.1 and further versions
