  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  pstore: Avoid kcore oops by vmap()ing with VM_IOREMAP

  An oops can be induced by running 'cat /proc/kcore > /dev/null' on
  devices using pstore with the ram backend because kmap_atomic() assumes
  lowmem pages are accessible with __va().

  During early boot, memblock reserves the pages for the ramoops reserved
  memory node in DT that would otherwise be part of the direct lowmem
  mapping. Pstore's ram backend reuses those reserved pages to change the
  memory type (writeback or non-cached) by passing the pages to vmap()
  (see pfn_to_page() usage in persistent_ram_vmap() for more details) with
  specific flags. When read_kcore() starts iterating over the vmalloc
  region, it runs over the virtual address that vmap() returned for
  ramoops. In aligned_vread() the virtual address is passed to
  vmalloc_to_page() which returns the page struct for the reserved lowmem
  area. That lowmem page is passed to kmap_atomic(), which effectively
  calls page_to_virt() that assumes a lowmem page struct must be directly
  accessible with __va() and friends. These pages are mapped via vmap()
  though, and the lowmem mapping was never made, so accessing them via the
  lowmem virtual address oopses like above.

  Let's side-step this problem by passing VM_IOREMAP to vmap(). This will
  tell vread() to not include the ramoops region in the kcore. Instead the
  area will look like a bunch of zeros. The alternative is to teach kmap()
  about vmalloc areas that intersect with lowmem. Presumably such a change
  isn't a one-liner, and there isn't much interest in inspecting the
  ramoops region in kcore files anyway, so the most expedient route is
  taken for now.
