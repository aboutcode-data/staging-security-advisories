aliases: []
summary: A type confusion in jsish 2.0 allows incorrect control flow during execution of the
  OP_NEXT opcode. When an “instanceof” expression uses an array element access as the left-hand
  operand inside a for-in loop, the instructions implementation leaves an additional array reference
  on the stack rather than consuming it during OP_INSTANCEOF. As a result, OP_NEXT interprets
  the array as an iterator object and reads the iterCmd function pointer from an invalid structure,
  potentially causing a crash or enabling code execution depending on heap layout.
