aliases: []
summary: 'Argo Workflows Chart is used to set up argo and its needed dependencies through one
  command. Prior to 0.44.0, the workflow-role has excessive privileges, the worst being create
  pods/exec, which will allow kubectl exec into any Pod in the same namespace, i.e. arbitrary
  code execution within those Pods. If a user can be made to run a malicious template, their
  whole namespace can be compromised. This affects versions of the argo-workflows Chart that
  use appVersion: 3.4 and above, which no longer need these permissions for the only available
  Executor, Emissary. It could also affect users below 3.4 depending on their choice of Executor
  in those versions. This only affects the Helm Chart and not the upstream manifests. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.44.0.'
