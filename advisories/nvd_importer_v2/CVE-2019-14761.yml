aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in KaiOS 2.5. The pre-installed Note application is vulnerable
  to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. A local attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into
  the Note application. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the
  Note application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter
  credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows
  an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.
