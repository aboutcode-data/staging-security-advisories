aliases: []
summary: Outline is a service that allows for collaborative documentation. In versions 0.72.0
  through 0.83.0, Outline introduced a feature which facilitates local file system storage capabilities
  as an optional file storage strategy. This feature allowed a CSP bypass as well as a ContentType
  bypass that might facilitate further attacks. In the case of self-hosting and using Outline
  FILE_STORAGE=local on the same domain as the Outline application, a malicious payload can
  be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions, allowing script execution
  within the context of another user. This is fixed in version 0.84.0.
