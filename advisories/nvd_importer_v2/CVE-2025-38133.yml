  iio: adc: ad4851: fix ad4858 chan pointer handling

  The pointer returned from ad4851_parse_channels_common() is incremented
  internally as each channel is populated. In ad4858_parse_channels(),
  the same pointer was further incremented while setting ext_scan_type
  fields for each channel. This resulted in indio_dev->channels being set
  to a pointer past the end of the allocated array, potentially causing
  memory corruption or undefined behavior.

  Fix this by iterating over the channels using an explicit index instead
  of incrementing the pointer. This preserves the original base pointer
  and ensures all channel metadata is set correctly.
