summary: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is
  a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is
  configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration,
  the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration
  requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require
  virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling
  allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this
  meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm
  sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator.
  This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can
  only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be
  a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of
  linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use
  linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any
  production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime
  2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring
  the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent
  memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically
  disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value
  is greater than zero.
