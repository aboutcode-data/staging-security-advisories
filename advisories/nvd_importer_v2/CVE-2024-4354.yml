aliases: []
summary: The TablePress – Tables in WordPress made easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.3 via the get_files_to_import()
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and
  above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and
  can be used to query and modify information from internal services. Due to the complex nature
  of protecting against DNS rebind attacks in WordPress software, we settled on the developer
  simply restricting the usage of the URL import functionality to just administrators. While
  this is not optimal, we feel this poses a minimal risk to most site owners and ideally WordPress
  core would correct this issue in wp_safe_remote_get() and other functions.
