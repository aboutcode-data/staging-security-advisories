aliases: []
summary: MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management,
  interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject
  to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request
  forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal
  resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by
  a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known
  workarounds.
