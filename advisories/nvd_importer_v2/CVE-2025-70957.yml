aliases: []
summary: A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in the TON Lite Server before
  v2024.09. The vulnerability arises from the handling of external arguments passed to locally
  executed "get methods." An attacker can inject a constructed Continuation object (an internal
  TVM type) that is normally restricted within the VM. When the TVM executes this malicious
  continuation, it consumes excessive CPU resources while accruing disproportionately low virtual
  gas costs. This "free" computation allows an attacker to monopolize the Lite Server's processing
  power, significantly reducing its throughput and causing a denial of service for legitimate
  users acting through the gateway.
