aliases: []
summary: The OneSignal – Web Push Notifications plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  modification of data due to a missing capability check on the settings handling functionality
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1. This is due to the plugin processing POST requests
  without verifying user capabilities or nonces. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to overwrite the OneSignal App ID, REST API key, and notification behavior via direct
  POST requests.
