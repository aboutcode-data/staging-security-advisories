aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting
  in version 10.3.0 and prior to version 10.5.0, the permission filters (i.e. `user_created
  IS $CURRENT_USER`) are not properly checked when using GraphQL subscription resulting in unauthorized
  users getting event on their subscription which they should not be receiving according to
  the permissions. This can be any collection but out-of-the box the `directus_users` collection
  is configured with such a permissions filter allowing you to get updates for other users when
  changes happen. Version 10.5.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, disable GraphQL subscriptions.
