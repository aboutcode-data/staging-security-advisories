aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Prior to
  versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and
  brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole
  in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account.
  This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827 intended to protect against brute-force attacks.
  The application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts
  for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker
  can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users, thereby
  pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for
  that account. This is a severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force
  attacks at an accelerated rate, especially targeting the default admin account. Users should
  upgrade to version 2.8.13, 2.9.9, or 2.10.4 to receive a patch.
