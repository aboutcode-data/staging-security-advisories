aliases: []
summary: A sandbox escape issue was discovered in TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway 7.07. It limits
  the admin user to a restricted shell, allowing execution of a small number of tools of the
  operating system. The restricted shell can be bypassed by presenting a fake vmware-tools ISO
  image to the guest virtual machine running SpamTitan Gateway. This ISO image should contain
  a valid Perl script at the vmware-freebsd-tools/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl path.
  The fake ISO image will be mounted and the script wmware-install.pl will be executed with
  super-user privileges as soon as the hidden option to install VMware Tools is selected in
  the main menu of the restricted shell (option number 5). The contents of the script can be
  whatever the attacker wants, including a backdoor or similar.
