aliases: []
summary: The Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 7.0.7. This is due to a missing
  capability check in the 'save_custom_user_profile_fields' function. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply the
  'ec_store_admin_access' parameter during a profile update and gain store manager access to
  the site.
