summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  RDMA/core: always drop device refcount in ib_del_sub_device_and_put()

  Since nldev_deldev() (introduced by commit 060c642b2ab8 ("RDMA/nldev: Add
  support to add/delete a sub IB device through netlink") grabs a reference
  using ib_device_get_by_index() before calling ib_del_sub_device_and_put(),
  we need to drop that reference before returning -EOPNOTSUPP error.
