aliases: []
summary: In SilverStripe through 4.5.0, a specific URL path configured by default through the
  silverstripe/framework module can be used to disclose the fact that a domain is hosting a
  Silverstripe application. There is no disclosure of the specific version. The functionality
  on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and is not known to present a vulnerability
  through web-based access. As a side-effect, this preconfigured path also blocks the creation
  of other resources on this path (e.g. a page).
