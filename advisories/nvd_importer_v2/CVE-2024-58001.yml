summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ocfs2: handle a symlink read error correctly

  Patch series "Convert ocfs2 to use folios".

  Mark did a conversion of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as a
  giant patch for review ;-)

  So I've redone it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patches
  where his code is substantially the same.  It's not a bad way to do it;
  his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all our
  bugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all the
  changes I made to his code!
