aliases: []
summary: opensearch-ruby is a community-driven, open source fork of elasticsearch-ruby. In versions
  prior to 2.0.1 the ruby `YAML.load` function was used instead of `YAML.safe_load`. As a result
  opensearch-ruby 2.0.0 and prior can lead to unsafe deserialization using YAML.load if the
  response is of type YAML. An attacker must be in control of an opensearch server and convince
  the victim to connect to it in order to exploit this vulnerability. The problem has been patched
  in opensearch-ruby gem version 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
