aliases: []
summary: The WP Users Exporter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions
  up to, and including, 1.4.2 via the 'Export Users' functionality. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, such as a subscriber, to add untrusted input into profile information
  like First Names that will embed into the exported CSV file triggered by an administrator
  and can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system
  with a vulnerable configuration.
