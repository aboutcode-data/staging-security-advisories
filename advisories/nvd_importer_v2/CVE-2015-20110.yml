aliases: []
summary: JHipster generator-jhipster before 2.23.0 allows a timing attack against validateToken
  due to a string comparison that stops at the first character that is different. Attackers
  can guess tokens by brute forcing one character at a time and observing the timing. This of
  course drastically reduces the search space to a linear amount of guesses based on the token
  length times the possible characters.
