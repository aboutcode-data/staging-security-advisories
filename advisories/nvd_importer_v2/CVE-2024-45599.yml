aliases: []
summary: "Cursor is an artificial intelligence code editor. Prior to version 0.41.0, if a user\
  \ on macOS has granted Cursor access to the camera or microphone, any program that is run\
  \ on the machine is able to access the camera or the microphone without explicitly being granted\
  \ access, through a DyLib Injection using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable. The\
  \ usage of `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`\
  \ allows an external dynamic library to be injected into the application using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES\
  \ environment variable. \nMoreover, the entitlement `com.apple.security.device.camera` allows\
  \ the application to use the host camera and `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` allows\
  \ the application to use the microphone. This means that untrusted code that is executed on\
  \ the user's machine can access the camera or the microphone, if the user has already given\
  \ permission for Cursor to do so. In version 0.41.0, the entitlements have been split by process:\
  \ the main process gets the camera and microphone entitlements, but not the DyLib entitlements,\
  \ whereas the extension host process gets the DyLib entitlements but not the camera or microphone\
  \ entitlements. As a workaround, do not explicitly give Cursor the permission to access the\
  \ camera or microphone if untrusted users can run arbitrary commands on the affected machine."
