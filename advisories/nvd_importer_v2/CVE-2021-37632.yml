aliases: []
summary: SuperMartijn642's Config Lib is a library used by a number of mods for the game Minecraft.
  The versions of SuperMartijn642's Config Lib between 1.0.4 and 1.0.8 are affected by a vulnerability
  and can be exploited on both servers and clients. Using SuperMartijn642's Config Lib, servers
  will send a packet to clients with the server's config values. In order to read `enum` values
  from the packet data, `ObjectInputStream#readObject` is used. `ObjectInputStream#readObject`
  will instantiate a class based on the input data. Since, the packet data is not validated
  before `ObjectInputStream#readObject` is called, an attacker can instantiate any class by
  sending a malicious packet. If a suitable class is found, the vulnerability can lead to a
  number of exploits, including remote code execution. Although the vulnerable packet is typically
  only send from server to client, it can theoretically also be send from client to server.
  This means both clients and servers running SuperMartijn642's Config Lib between 1.0.4 and
  1.0.8 are vulnerable. The vulnerability has been patched in SuperMartijn642's Config lib 1.0.9.
  Both, players and server owners, should update to 1.0.9 or higher.
