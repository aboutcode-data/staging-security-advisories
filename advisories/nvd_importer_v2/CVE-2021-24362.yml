aliases: []
summary: The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery WordPress plugin before
  1.5.75 did not ensure that uploaded SVG files added to a gallery do not contain malicious
  content. As a result, users allowed to add images to gallery can upload an SVG file containing
  JavaScript code, which will be executed when accessing the image directly (ie in the /wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/
  folder), leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue
