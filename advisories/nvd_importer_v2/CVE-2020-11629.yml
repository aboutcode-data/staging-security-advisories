aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. The External
  Command Certificate Validator, which allows administrators to upload external linters to validate
  certificates, is supposed to save uploaded test certificates to the server. An attacker who
  has gained access to the CA UI could exploit this to upload malicious scripts to the server.
  (Risks associated with this issue alone are negligible unless a malicious user already has
  gained access to the CA UI through other means, as a trusted user is already trusted to upload
  scripts by virtue of having access to the validator.)
