aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated device registration vulnerability, caused by Improperly Controlled
  Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes, has been identified in the MXsecurity
  Series. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially
  crafted JSON payload to the device's registration endpoint /api/v1/devices/register, allowing
  the attacker to register unauthorized devices without authentication. Although exploiting
  this vulnerability has limited modification of data, there is no impact to the confidentiality
  and availability of the affected device, as well as no loss of confidentiality, integrity,
  and availability within any subsequent systems.
