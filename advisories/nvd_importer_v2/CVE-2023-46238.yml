aliases: []
summary: ZITADEL is an identity infrastructure management system. ZITADEL users can upload their
  own avatar image using various image types including SVG. SVG can include scripts, such as
  javascript, which can be executed during rendering. Due to a missing security header, an attacker
  could inject code to an SVG to gain access to the victim’s account in certain scenarios. A
  victim would need to directly open the malicious image in the browser, where a single session
  in ZITADEL needs to be active for this exploit to work. If the possible victim had multiple
  or no active sessions in ZITADEL, the attack would not succeed. This issue has been patched
  in version 2.39.2 and 2.38.2.
