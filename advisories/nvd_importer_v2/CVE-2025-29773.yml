aliases: []
summary: Froxlor is open-source server administration software. A vulnerability in versions
  prior to 2.2.6 allows users (such as resellers or customers) to create accounts with the same
  email address as an existing account. This creates potential issues with account identification
  and security. This vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users (e.g., reseller,
  customer) who can create accounts with the same email address that has already been used by
  another account, such as the admin. The attack vector is email-based, as the system does not
  prevent multiple accounts from registering the same email address, leading to possible conflicts
  and security issues. Version 2.2.6 fixes the issue.
