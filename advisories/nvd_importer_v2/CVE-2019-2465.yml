  (subcomponent: Outside In Filters). Supported versions that are affected are 8.5.3 and 8.5.4.
  Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP

  in unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Outside In Technology accessible data. Note:
  Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS
  score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes
  that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code,
  but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower. CVSS 3.0 Base Score
  5.3 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).'
