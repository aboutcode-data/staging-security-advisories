summary: OpenClinic GA 5.194.18 is affected by Insecure Permissions. By default the Authenticated
  Users group has the modify permission to openclinic folders/files. A low privilege account
  is able to rename mysqld.exe or tomcat8.exe files located in bin folders and replace with
  a malicious file that would connect back to an attacking computer giving system level privileges
  (nt authority\system) due to the service running as Local System. While a low privilege user
  is unable to restart the service through the application, a restart of the computer triggers
  the execution of the malicious file. The application also have unquoted service path issues.
