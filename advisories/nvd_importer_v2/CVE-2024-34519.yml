summary: Avantra Server 24.x before 24.0.7 and 24.1.x before 24.1.1 mishandles the security
  of dashboards, aka XAN-5367. If a user can create a dashboard with an auto-login user, data
  disclosure may occur. Access control can be bypassed when there is a shared dashboard, and
  its auto-login user has privileges that a dashboard visitor should not have.
