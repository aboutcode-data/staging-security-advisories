summary: The NPort 6100-G2/6200-G2 Series is affected by an execution with unnecessary privileges
  vulnerability (CVE-2025-1977) that allows an authenticated user with read-only access to perform
  unauthorized configuration changes through the MCC (Moxa CLI Configuration) tool. The issue
  can be exploited remotely over the network with low-attack complexity and no user interaction
  but requires specific system conditions or configurations to be present. Successful exploitation
  may result in changes to device settings that were not intended to be permitted for the affected
  user role, potentially leading to a high impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  of the device. No impact on other systems has been identified.
