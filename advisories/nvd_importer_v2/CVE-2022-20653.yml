aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) email verification
  component of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
  device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling in DNS name resolution by
  the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially formatted
  email messages that are processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to cause the device to become unreachable from management interfaces or to process
  additional email messages for a period of time until the device recovers, resulting in a DoS
  condition. Continued attacks could cause the device to become completely unavailable, resulting
  in a persistent DoS condition.
