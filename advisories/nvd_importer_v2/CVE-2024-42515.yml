aliases: []
summary: Glossarizer through 1.5.2 improperly tries to convert text into HTML. Even though the
  application itself escapes special characters (e.g., <>), the underlying library converts
  these encoded characters into legitimate HTML, thereby possibly causing stored XSS. Attackers
  can append a XSS payload to a word that has a corresponding glossary entry.
