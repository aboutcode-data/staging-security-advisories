  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drivers/virt/acrn: fix PFNMAP PTE checks in acrn_vm_ram_map()

  Patch series "mm: follow_pte() improvements and acrn follow_pte() fixes".

  Patch #1 fixes a bunch of issues I spotted in the acrn driver.  It
  compiles, that's all I know.  I'll appreciate some review and testing from
  acrn folks.

  Patch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, adding
  more sanity checks, and improving the documentation.  Gave it a quick test
  on x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte().


  This patch (of 3):

  We currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerous
  follow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage.

  (1) We're not checking PTE write permissions.

  Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do for
  pin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so let's check for
  ACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now.

  (2) We're not rejecting refcounted pages.

  As we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages is
  dangerous and can result in use-after-free. Let's make sure to reject them.

  (3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range.

  We only lookup a single PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area.
  Let's loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range is
  actually contiguous. Reject everything else: it couldn't have worked
  either way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldn't be accessing.
