aliases: []
summary: The modelscope/ms-swift library thru 2.6.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution
  through deserialization of untrusted data within the `load_model_meta()` function of the `ModelFileSystemCache()`
  class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized
  `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources.
  This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading
  a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers
  to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden
  file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the
  model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal
  training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code
  execution.
