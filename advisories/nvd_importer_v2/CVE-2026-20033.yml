summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an\
  \ affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation when processing\
  \ specific Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted\
  \ Ethernet frame to the&nbsp;management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS\
  \ condition.\r\nNote: Only the out-of-band (OOB) management interface is affected."
