aliases: []
summary: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio
  and video content. Prior to Opencast 17.8 and 18.2, in some situations, Opencast's editor
  may publish a video without notifying the user. This may lead to users accidentally publishing
  media not meant for publishing, and thus possibly exposing internal media. This risk of this
  actually impacting someone is very low, though. This can only be triggered by users with write
  access to an event. They also have to use the editor, which is usually an action taken if
  they want to publish media and not something users would use on internal media they do not
  want to publish. Finally, they have to first click on "Save & Publish" before then selecting
  the "Save" option. Nevertheless, while very unlikely, this can happen. This issue is fixed
  in Opencast 17.8 and 18.2.
