aliases: []
summary: Wire web-app is part of Wire communications. Versions prior to 2022-11-02 are subject
  to Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions. In the wire-webapp, certain combinations of
  Markdown formatting can trigger an unhandled error in the conversion to HTML representation.
  The error makes it impossible to display the affected chat history, other conversations are
  not affected. The issue has been fixed in version 2022-11-02 and is already deployed on all
  Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag
  2022-11-02-production.0-v0.31.9-0-337e400 or wire-server 2022-11-03 (chart/4.26.0), so that
  their applications are no longer affected. As a workaround, you may use an iOS or Android
  client and delete the corresponding message from the history OR write 30 or more messages
  into the affected conversation to prevent the client from further rendering of the corresponding
  message. When attempting to retrieve messages from the conversation history, the error will
  continue to occur once the malformed message is part of the result.
