summary: "The target device exposes a service on a specific TCP port with a configured\n endpoint.\
  \ The access to that endpoint is granted using a Basic Authentication\n method. The endpoint\
  \ accepts also the PUT method and it is possible to \nwrite files on the target device file\
  \ system. Files are written as root.\n Using Postman it is possible to perform a Directory\
  \ Traversal attack \nand write files into any location of the device file system. Similarly\
  \ to the PUT method, it is possible to leverage the \nsame mechanism to read any file from\
  \ the file system by using the GET \nmethod."
