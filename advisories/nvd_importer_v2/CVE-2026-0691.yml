aliases: []
summary: The CM E-Mail Blacklist – Simple email filtering for safer registration plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'black_email' parameter in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and
  output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where
  unfiltered_html has been disabled.
