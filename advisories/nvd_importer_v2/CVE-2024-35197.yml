aliases: []
summary: gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. On Windows, fetching refs that clash
  with legacy device names reads from the devices, and checking out paths that clash with such
  names writes arbitrary data to the devices. This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause
  indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the
  application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances. If Windows
  is not used, or untrusted repositories are not cloned or otherwise used, then there is no
  impact. A minor degradation in availability may also be possible, such as with a very large
  file named `CON`, though the user could interrupt the application.
