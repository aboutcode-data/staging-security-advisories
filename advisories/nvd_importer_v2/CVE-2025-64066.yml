aliases: []
summary: Primakon Pi Portal 1.0.18 REST /api/v2/user/register endpoint suffers from a Broken
  Access Control vulnerability. The endpoint fails to implement any authorization checks, allowing
  unauthenticated attackers to perform POST requests to register new user accounts in the application's
  local database. This bypasses the intended security architecture, which relies on an external
  Identity Provider for initial user registration and assumes that internal user creation is
  an administrative-only function. This vector can also be chained with other vulnerabilities
  for privilege escalation and complete compromise of application. This specific request can
  be used to also enumerate already registered user accounts, aiding in social engineering or
  further targeted attacks.
