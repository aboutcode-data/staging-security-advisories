summary: Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology.
  This vulnerability report describes a reflected XSS vulnerability with full CSP bypass in
  Nextcloud installations using the recommended bundle. The vulnerability can be exploited to
  perform a trivial account takeover attack. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious
  code into web pages, which can be executed in the context of the victim's browser session.
  This means that an attacker can steal sensitive data, such as login credentials or personal
  information, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying or
  deleting data. In this specific case, the vulnerability allows for a trivial account takeover
  attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to inject code into the victim's browser
  session, allowing the attacker to take over the victim's account without their knowledge or
  consent. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and data, as well as
  the ability to perform actions on behalf of the victim. Furthermore, the fact that the vulnerability
  bypasses the Content Security Policy (CSP) makes it more dangerous, as CSP is an important
  security mechanism used to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. By bypassing CSP, attackers
  can circumvent the security measures put in place by the web application and execute their
  malicious code. This issue has been patched in versions 22.05.13, 21.11.9, and 6.4.27. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
