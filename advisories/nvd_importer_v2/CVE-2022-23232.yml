aliases: []
summary: StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) versions prior to 11.6.0 are susceptible
  to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could allow disabled, expired, or locked
  external user accounts to access S3 data to which they previously had access. StorageGRID
  11.6.0 obtains the user account status from Active Directory or Azure and will block S3 access
  for disabled user accounts during the subsequent background synchronization. User accounts
  that are expired or locked for Active Directory or Azure, or user accounts that are disabled,
  expired, or locked in identity sources other than Active Directory or Azure must be manually
  removed from group memberships or have their S3 keys manually removed from Tenant Manager
  in all versions of StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale).
