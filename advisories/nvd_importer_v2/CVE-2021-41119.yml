aliases: []
summary: Wire-server is the system server for the wire back-end services. Releases prior to
  v2022-03-01 are subject to a denial of service attack via a crafted object causing a hash
  collision. This collision causes the server to spend at least quadratic time parsing it which
  can lead to a denial of service for a heavily used server. The issue has been fixed in wire-server
  2022-03-01 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server
  need to be updated to 2022-03-01, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
