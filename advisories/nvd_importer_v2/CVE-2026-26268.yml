aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Sandbox escape via writing .git
  configuration was possible in versions prior to 2.5. A malicious agent (ie prompt injection)
  could write to improperly protected .git settings, including git hooks, which may cause out-of-sandbox
  RCE next time they are triggered. No user interaction was required as Git executes these commands
  automatically. Fixed in version 2.5.
