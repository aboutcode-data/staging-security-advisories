aliases: []
summary: The User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User
  Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'gdpr_communication_preferences[]'
  parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.14.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when the GDPR Communication Preferences
  module is enabled and at least one GDPR Communication Preferences field has been added to
  the edit profile form.
