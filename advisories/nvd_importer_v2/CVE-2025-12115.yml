aliases: []
summary: The WPC Name Your Price for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  price alteration in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.9. This is due to the plugin not
  disabling the ability to name a custom price when it has been specifically disabled for a
  product. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to purchase products at prices
  less than they should be able to.
