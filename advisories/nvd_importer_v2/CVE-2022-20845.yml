summary: "A vulnerability in the TL1 function of Cisco&nbsp;Network Convergence System (NCS)\
  \ 4000 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a memory leak in the TL1\
  \ process.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to TL1 not freeing memory under some conditions. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the device and issuing TL1 commands\
  \ after being authenticated. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the TL1\
  \ process to consume large amounts of memory. When the memory reaches a threshold, the Resource\
  \ Monitor (Resmon)&nbsp;process will begin to restart or shutdown the top five consumers of\
  \ memory, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates\
  \ that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.This\
  \ advisory is part of the September 2022 release of the Cisco&nbsp;IOS XR Software Security\
  \ Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see\
