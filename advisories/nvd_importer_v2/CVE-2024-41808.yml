aliases: []
summary: The OpenObserve open-source observability platform provides the ability to filter logs
  in a dashboard by the values uploaded in a given log. However, all versions of the platform
  through 0.9.1 do not sanitize user input in the filter selection menu, which may result in
  complete account takeover. It has been noted that the front-end uses `DOMPurify` or Vue templating
  to escape cross-site scripting (XSS) extensively, however certain areas of the front end lack
  this XSS protection. When combining the missing protection with the insecure authentication
  handling that the front-end uses, a malicious user may be able to take over any victim's account
  provided they meet the exploitation steps. As of time of publication, no patched version is
  available.
