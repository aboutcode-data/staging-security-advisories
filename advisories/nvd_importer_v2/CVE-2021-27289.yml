aliases: []
summary: A replay attack vulnerability was discovered in a Zigbee smart home kit manufactured
  by Ksix (Zigbee Gateway Module = v1.0.3, Door Sensor = v1.0.7, Motion Sensor = v1.0.12), where
  the Zigbee anti-replay mechanism - based on the frame counter field - is improperly implemented.
  As a result, an attacker within wireless range can resend captured packets with a higher sequence
  number, which the devices incorrectly accept as legitimate messages. This allows spoofed commands
  to be injected without authentication, triggering false alerts and misleading the user through
  notifications in the mobile application used to monitor the network.
