  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: pcm: Fix potential AB/BA lock with buffer_mutex and mmap_lock

  syzbot caught a potential deadlock between the PCM
  runtime->buffer_mutex and the mm->mmap_lock.  It was brought by the
  recent fix to cover the racy read/write and other ioctls, and in that
  commit, I overlooked a (hopefully only) corner case that may take the
  revert lock, namely, the OSS mmap.  The OSS mmap operation
  exceptionally allows to re-configure the parameters inside the OSS
  mmap syscall, where mm->mmap_mutex is already held.  Meanwhile, the
  copy_from/to_user calls at read/write operations also take the
  mm->mmap_lock internally, hence it may lead to a AB/BA deadlock.

  A similar problem was already seen in the past and we fixed it with a
  refcount (in commit b248371628aa).  The former fix covered only the
  call paths with OSS read/write and OSS ioctls, while we need to cover
  the concurrent access via both ALSA and OSS APIs now.

  This patch addresses the problem above by replacing the buffer_mutex
  lock in the read/write operations with a refcount similar as we've
  used for OSS.  The new field, runtime->buffer_accessing, keeps the
  number of concurrent read/write operations.  Unlike the former
  buffer_mutex protection, this protects only around the
  copy_from/to_user() calls; the other codes are basically protected by
  the PCM stream lock.  The refcount can be a negative, meaning blocked
  by the ioctls.  If a negative value is seen, the read/write aborts
  with -EBUSY.  In the ioctl side, OTOH, they check this refcount, too,
  and set to a negative value for blocking unless it's already being
  accessed.
