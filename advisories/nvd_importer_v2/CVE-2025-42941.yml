aliases: []
summary: SAP Fiori (Launchpad) is vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing vulnerability due to inadequate
  external navigation protections for its link (<a>) elements. An attacker with administrative
  user privileges could exploit this by leveraging compromised or malicious pages. While administrative
  access is necessary for certain configurations, the attacker does not need the administrative
  privileges to execute the attack. This could result in unintended manipulation of user sessions
  or exposure of sensitive information. The issue impacts the confidentiality and integrity
  of the system, but the availability remains unaffected.
