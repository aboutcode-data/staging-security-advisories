aliases: []
summary: "The Candid library causes a Denial of Service while \nparsing a specially crafted\
  \ payload with 'empty' data type. For example,\n if the payload is `record { * ; empty }`\
  \ and the canister interface expects `record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty\
  \ as an extra field required by the type.  The problem with the type empty is that the candid\
  \ Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable error when skipping the field and\
  \ thus causing an infinite decoding loop.\n\n\nCanisters using affected versions of candid\n\
  \ are exposed to denial of service by causing the decoding to run \nindefinitely until the\
  \ canister traps due to reaching maximum \ninstruction limit per execution round. Repeated\
  \ exposure to the payload \nwill result in degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisters\
  \ written in Motoko are unaffected."
