summary: "Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links. A missing Authorization vulnerability\
  \ in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links\
  \ \nto be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, documents\
  \ that used \"OLE objects\" linked to external files would \nload the contents of those files\
  \ without prompting the user for \npermission to do so.\n\nThis issue affects Apache OpenOffice:\
  \ through 4.1.15.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.16, which fixes the issue."
