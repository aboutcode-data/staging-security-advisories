summary: 'Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite component in Oracle
  Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and 12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality
  and integrity via unknown vectors related to Load Testing for Web Apps, a different vulnerability
  than CVE-2016-0492.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has
  not commented on third-party claims that this is a directory traversal vulnerability in the
  isAllowedUrl function in the admin pages, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication
  and gain administrator access via directory traversal sequences following a URI entry that
  does not require authentication.'
