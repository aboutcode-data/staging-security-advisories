aliases: []
summary: Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in
  PHP. UNION SQL injection and time-based blind injection vulnerabilities existed in Time Tracker
  Puncher plugin in versions of anuko timetracker prior to 1.20.0.5642. This was happening because
  the Puncher plugin was reusing code from other places and was relying on an unsanitized date
  parameter in POST requests. Because the parameter was not checked, it was possible to craft
  POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue has been resolved in
  in version 1.20.0.5642. Users unable to upgrade are advised to add their own checks to input.
