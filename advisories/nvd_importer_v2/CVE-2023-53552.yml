summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/i915: mark requests for GuC virtual engines to avoid use-after-free

  References to i915_requests may be trapped by userspace inside a
  sync_file or dmabuf (dma-resv) and held indefinitely across different
  proceses. To counter-act the memory leaks, we try to not to keep
  references from the request past their completion.
  On the other side on fence release we need to know if rq->engine
  is valid and points to hw engine (true for non-virtual requests).
  To make it possible extra bit has been added to rq->execution_mask,
  for marking virtual engines.

  (cherry picked from commit 280410677af763f3871b93e794a199cfcf6fb580)
