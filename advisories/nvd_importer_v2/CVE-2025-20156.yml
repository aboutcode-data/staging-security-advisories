summary: "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Meeting Management could allow a remote,\
  \ authenticated attacker with low privileges to elevate privileges to administrator on an\
  \ affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because proper authorization is not enforced\
  \ upon&nbsp;REST API users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests\

  \ control over edge nodes that are managed by Cisco Meeting Management."
