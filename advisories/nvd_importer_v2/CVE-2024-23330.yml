summary: Tuta is an encrypted email service. In versions prior to 119.10, an attacker can attach
  an image in a html mail which is loaded from external resource in the default setting, which
  should prevent loading of external resources. When displaying emails containing external content,
  they should be loaded by default only after confirmation by the user. However, it could be
  recognized that certain embedded images (see PoC) are loaded, even though the "Automatic Reloading
  of Images" function is disabled by default. The reloading is also done unencrypted via HTTP
  and redirections are followed. This behavior is unexpected for the user, since the user assumes
  that external content will only be loaded after explicit manual confirmation. The loading
  of external content in e-mails represents a risk, because this makes the sender aware that
  the e-mail address is used, when the e-mail was read, which device is used and expose the
  user's IP address. Version 119.10 contains a patch for this issue.
