aliases: []
summary: The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  in versions up to, and including 3.2.50. This is due to insufficient file type and path validation
  on the deleteFiles() function found in the ~/Admin/Menu/Packages.php file that triggers upon
  download post deletion. This makes it possible for contributor level users and above to supply
  an arbitrary file path via the 'file[files]' parameter when creating a download post and once
  the user deletes the post the supplied arbitrary file will be deleted. This can be used by
  attackers to delete the /wp-config.php file which will reset the installation and make it
  possible for an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server.
