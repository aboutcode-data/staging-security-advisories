aliases: []
summary: The User Registration & Membership – Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User
  Profile plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up
  to, and including, 5.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the user_registration_pro_delete_account()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force delete users, including
  administrators, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
