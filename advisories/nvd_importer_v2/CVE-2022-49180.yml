summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  LSM: general protection fault in legacy_parse_param

  The usual LSM hook "bail on fail" scheme doesn't work for cases where
  a security module may return an error code indicating that it does not
  recognize an input.  In this particular case Smack sees a mount option
  that it recognizes, and returns 0. A call to a BPF hook follows, which
  returns -ENOPARAM, which confuses the caller because Smack has processed
  its data.

  The SELinux hook incorrectly returns 1 on success. There was a time
  when this was correct, however the current expectation is that it
  return 0 on success. This is repaired.
