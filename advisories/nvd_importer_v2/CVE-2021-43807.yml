aliases: []
summary: Opencast is an Open Source Lecture Capture & Video Management for Education. Opencast
  versions prior to 9.10 allow HTTP method spoofing, allowing to change the assumed HTTP method
  via URL parameter. This allows attackers to turn HTTP GET requests into PUT requests or an
  HTTP form to send DELETE requests. This bypasses restrictions otherwise put on these types
  of requests and aids in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, which would otherwise not
  be possible. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft links or forms which may change the
  server state. This issue is fixed in Opencast 9.10 and 10.0. You can mitigate the problem
  by setting the `SameSite=Strict` attribute for your cookies. If this is a viable option for
  you depends on your integrations. We strongly recommend updating in any case.
