aliases: []
summary: seroval facilitates JS value stringification, including complex structures beyond JSON.stringify
  capabilities. In versions 1.4.0 and below, improper input handling in the JSON deserialization
  component can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution. Exploitation is possible via overriding
  constant value and error deserialization, allowing indirect access to unsafe JS evaluation.
  At minimum, attackers need the ability to perform 4 separate requests on the same function,
  and partial knowledge of how the serialized data is used during later runtime processing.
  This vulnerability affects the fromJSON and fromCrossJSON functions in a client-to-server
  transmission scenario. This issue has been fixed in version 1.4.0.
