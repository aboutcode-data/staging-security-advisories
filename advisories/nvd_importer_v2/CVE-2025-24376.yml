aliases: []
summary: kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register
  Kubewarden admission policies. By design, AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate
  only namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules provided
  by the user when defining the policy. There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that
  should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because
  of their sensitive nature. For example, PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain
  the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace. An attacker can use either
  an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent the creation and update of PolicyReport
  objects to hide non-compliant resources. Moreover, the same attacker might use a mutating
  AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace.
  Starting from the 1.21.0 release, the validation rules applied to AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup
  have been tightened to prevent them from validating sensitive types of namespaced resources.
