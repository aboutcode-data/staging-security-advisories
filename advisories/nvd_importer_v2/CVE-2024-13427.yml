summary: 'The Page Builder: Pagelayer – Drag and Drop website builder plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s Button widget in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on

  completely fixed in version 2.0.1.'
