aliases: []
summary: "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform includes functionality to initiate\
  \ SSH sessions to remote CPEs and the Director shell via Shell-In-A-Box. The underlying Python\
  \ script, shell-connect.py, is vulnerable to command injection through the user argument.\
  \ This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. \r\n\r\nExploitation\
  \ Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability\
  \ was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party\
  \ security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds\
  \ to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated\
  \ software versions."
