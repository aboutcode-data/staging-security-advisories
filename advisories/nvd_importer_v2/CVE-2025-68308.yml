  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: kvaser_usb: leaf: Fix potential infinite loop in command parsers

  The `kvaser_usb_leaf_wait_cmd()` and `kvaser_usb_leaf_read_bulk_callback`
  functions contain logic to zero-length commands. These commands are used
  to align data to the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary.

  The driver attempts to skip these placeholders by aligning the buffer
  position `pos` to the next packet boundary using `round_up()` function.

  However, if zero-length command is found exactly on a packet boundary
  (i.e., `pos` is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize, including 0), `round_up`
  function will return the unchanged value of `pos`. This prevents `pos`
  to be increased, causing an infinite loop in the parsing logic.

  This patch fixes this in the function by using `pos + 1` instead.
  This ensures that even if `pos` is on a boundary, the calculation is
  based on `pos + 1`, forcing `round_up()` to always return the next
  aligned boundary.
