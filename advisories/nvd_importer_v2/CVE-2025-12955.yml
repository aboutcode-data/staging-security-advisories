aliases: []
summary: The Live sales notification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing
  Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.39. This is due to the "getOrders"
  function lacking proper authorization and capability checks when the plugin is configured
  to display recent order information. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to extract sensitive customer information including buyer first names, city, state, country,
  purchase time and date, and product details.
