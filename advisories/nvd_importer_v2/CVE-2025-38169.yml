  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP

  On system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously
  clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
  restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.

  If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch
  to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
  restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while
  the CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()
  subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an
  SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from
  streaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of
  FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.

  Fix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel
  FPSIMD state.
