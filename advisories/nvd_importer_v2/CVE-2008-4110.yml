summary: 'Buffer overflow in the SQLVDIRLib.SQLVDirControl ActiveX control in Tools\Binn\sqlvdir.dll
  in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (aka SQL Server 8.0) allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (browser crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long URL in the second

  since the control is not marked as safe for scripting and would not execute with default Internet
  Explorer settings.'
