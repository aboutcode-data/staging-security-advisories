aliases: []
summary: SFTPGo is a full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server
  - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob. One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have
  the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature
  is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any
  SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container
  with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators
  who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing
  the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default
  in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo
  must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.
