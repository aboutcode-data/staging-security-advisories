summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bnxt_en: Fix null pointer dereference in bnxt_bs_trace_check_wrap()

  With older FW, we may get the ASYNC_EVENT_CMPL_EVENT_ID_DBG_BUF_PRODUCER
  for FW trace data type that has not been initialized.  This will result
  in a crash in bnxt_bs_trace_type_wrap().  Add a guard to check for a
  valid magic_byte pointer before proceeding.
