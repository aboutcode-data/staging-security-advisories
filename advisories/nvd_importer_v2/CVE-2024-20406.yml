aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the segment routing feature for the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate\
  \ System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent\
  \ attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of ingress IS-IS packets. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IS-IS packets to an affected device\
  \ after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IS-IS\
  \ process on all affected devices that are participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash\
  \ and restart, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\nNote: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol.\
  \ To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device\
  \ and must have formed an adjacency. This vulnerability affects segment routing for IS-IS\
  \ over IPv4 and IPv6 control planes as well as devices that are configured as level 1, level\
  \ 2, or multi-level routing IS-IS type."
