aliases: []
summary: libsnowflakeclient is the Snowflake Connector for C/C++. Versions starting from 0.5.0
  to before 2.2.0, are vulnerable to local logging of sensitive information. When the logging
  level was set to DEBUG, the Connector would log locally the client-side encryption master
  key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does
  not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations, and is not
  logged server-side by Snowflake. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.
