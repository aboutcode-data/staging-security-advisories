  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal

  Before 456d8aa37d0f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to
  avoid use-after-free"), we would free the ASPM link only after the last
  function on the bus pertaining to the given link was removed.

  That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function,
  link->downstream would point to free'd memory after.

  After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function
  removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.

  That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream
  port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which
  still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.

  The resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because
  pciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.

  On that switch, function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus.
  Free exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is
  obsolete, but after all subordinate links are gone.
