summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/panthor: Fix UAF on kernel BO VA nodes

  If the MMU is down, panthor_vm_unmap_range() might return an error.
  We expect the page table to be updated still, and if the MMU is blocked,
  the rest of the GPU should be blocked too, so no risk of accessing
  physical memory returned to the system (which the current code doesn't
  cover for anyway).

  Proceed with the rest of the cleanup instead of bailing out and leaving
  the va_node inserted in the drm_mm, which leads to UAF when other
  adjacent nodes are removed from the drm_mm tree.
