aliases: []
summary: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm
  the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced
  methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable
  on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the
  `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making
  http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1
  to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without
  upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env
  variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch
  any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only`
  for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update
  an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this
  issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to
  re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time
  of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases
  will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to
  ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY
  `variables.
