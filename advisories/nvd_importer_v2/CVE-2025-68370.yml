  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  coresight: tmc: add the handle of the event to the path

  The handle is essential for retrieving the AUX_EVENT of each CPU and is
  required in perf mode. It has been added to the coresight_path so that
  dependent devices can access it from the path when needed.

  The existing bug can be reproduced with:
  perf record -e cs_etm//k -C 0-9 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null

  Showing an oops as follows:
  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 000f6e84934ed19e

  Call trace:
