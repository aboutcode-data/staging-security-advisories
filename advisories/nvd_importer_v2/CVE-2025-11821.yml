aliases: []
summary: The Woocommerce – Products By Custom Tax plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the 'woo_products_custom_tax' shortcode in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
  supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
