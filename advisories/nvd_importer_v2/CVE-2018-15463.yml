aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface of an affected
  device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface
  to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to
  access sensitive browser-based information.
