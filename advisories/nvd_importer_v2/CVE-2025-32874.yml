aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Kaseya Rapid Fire Tools Network Detective through 2.0.16.0.
  A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented
  in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion. The method Encrypt(byte[] clearData) derives
  both the encryption key and the IV from a fixed, hardcoded input by using a static salt value.
  As a result, identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This
  is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words, there is a cryptographic
  implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption
  methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications, the logic consistently results in
  predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and
  encryption authentication.
