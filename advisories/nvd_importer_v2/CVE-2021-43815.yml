aliases: []
summary: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana prior
  to versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 has a directory traversal for arbitrary .csv files. It only affects
  instances that have the developer testing tool called TestData DB data source enabled and
  configured. The vulnerability is limited in scope, and only allows access to files with the
  extension .csv to authenticated users only. Grafana Cloud instances have not been affected
  by the vulnerability. Versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 contain a patch for this issue. There is a
  workaround available for users who cannot upgrade. Running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana
  that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. The proxy will have
  to also be able to handle url encoded paths.
