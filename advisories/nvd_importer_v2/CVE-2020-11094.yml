aliases: []
summary: The October CMS debugbar plugin before version 3.1.0 contains a feature where it will
  log all requests (and all information pertaining to each request including session data) whenever
  it is enabled. This presents a problem if the plugin is ever enabled on a system that is open
  to untrusted users as the potential exists for them to use this feature to view all requests
  being made to the application and obtain sensitive information from those requests. There
  even exists the potential for account takeovers of authenticated users by non-authenticated
  public users, which would then lead to a number of other potential issues as an attacker could
  theoretically get full access to the system if the required conditions existed. Issue has
  been patched in v3.1.0 by locking down access to the debugbar to all users; it now requires
  an authenticated backend user with a specifically enabled permission before it is even usable,
  and the feature that allows access to stored request information is restricted behind a different
  permission that's more restrictive.
