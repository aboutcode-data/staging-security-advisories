aliases: []
summary: Zed, a code editor, has a symlink escape vulnerability in versions prior to 0.225.9
  in Agent file tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`). It allows reading and writing files **outside
  the project directory** when a project contains symbolic links pointing to external paths.
  This bypasses the intended workspace boundary and privacy protections (`file_scan_exclusions`,
  `private_files`), potentially leaking sensitive user data to the LLM. Version 0.225.9 fixes
  the issue.
