aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 3.5.4, 2025.11.2,
  2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0, authenticated users can submit crafted payloads to /drafts.json that
  cause O(n^2) processing in Base62.decode, tying up workers for 35-60 seconds per request.
  This affects all users as the shared worker pool becomes exhausted. This issue is patched
  in versions 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0. Lowering the max_draft_length site
  setting reduces attack surface but does not fully mitigate the issue, as payloads under the
  limit can still trigger the slow code path.
