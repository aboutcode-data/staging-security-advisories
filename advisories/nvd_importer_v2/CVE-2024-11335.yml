summary: The UltraEmbed – Advanced Iframe Plugin For WordPress with Gutenberg Block Included
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'iframe'
  shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
