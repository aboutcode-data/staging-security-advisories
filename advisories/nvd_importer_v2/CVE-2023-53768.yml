  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  regmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers

  When allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in
  regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix
  with num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.

  This is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for
  each row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to
  allocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for
  each row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row
  (i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this
  allocation num_config_regs number of times.

  This scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs
  is greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating
  condition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register
  configuration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.

  Amit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device
  due to memory corruption (see "Closes" tag for Amit's report). The KASAN
  report below helped narrow it down to this issue:
