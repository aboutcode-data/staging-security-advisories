  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()

  evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through
  page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass, since
  folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the
  isolation.

  The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting
  scan_control->nr_scanned.  However, this can result in underflow of
  nr_scanned, under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment
  nr_scanned, i.e., when folio_trylock() fails.

  The underflow can cause the divisor, i.e., scale=scanned+reclaimed in
  vmpressure_calc_level(), to become zero, resulting in the following crash:

    [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]
    process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b

  Since scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics, the potential
  double counting has minimal risks.  Therefore, fix the problem by not
  deducting scan_control->nr_scanned in evict_folios().
