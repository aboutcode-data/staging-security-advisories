aliases: []
summary: Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that helps developers create
  custom Linux-based systems regardless of the hardware architecture. In Yocto Projects Bitbake
  before 2.6.2 (before and included Yocto Project 4.3.1), with the Toaster server (included
  in bitbake) running, missing input validation allows an attacker to perform a remote code
  execution in the server's shell via a crafted HTTP request. Authentication is not necessary.
  Toaster server execution has to be specifically run and is not the default for Bitbake command
  line builds, it is only used for the Toaster web based user interface to Bitbake. The fix
  has been backported to the bitbake included with Yocto Project 5.0, 3.1.31, 4.0.16, and 4.3.2.
