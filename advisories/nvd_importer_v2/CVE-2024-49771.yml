summary: MPXJ is an open source library to read and write project plans from a variety of file
  formats and databases. The patch for the historical vulnerability CVE-2020-35460 in MPXJ is
  incomplete as there is still a possibility that a malicious path could be constructed which
  would not be picked up by the original fix and allow files to be written to arbitrary locations.
  The issue is addressed in MPXJ version 13.5.1.
