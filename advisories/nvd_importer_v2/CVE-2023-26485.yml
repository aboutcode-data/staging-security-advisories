summary: "cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and\
  \ program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource\
  \ exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues\
  \ when parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has\
  \ been addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade\
  \ should validate that their input comes from trusted sources.\n\n\n\n\n### Impact\n\nA polynomial\
  \ time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent\
  \ denial of service.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```\n$ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = \"_\"\
  \ * 100000; print(pad + \".\" + pad, end=\"\")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext\n\
  ```\n\nIncreasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase\
  \ quadratically.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10.\n\
  \n### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm\n\nXXX: TBD\n\n[cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)\
  \ is a fork of [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub Flavored\
  \ Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time, but share a common core.\
  \ These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. \n\n### Credit\n\nWe would like to thank\
  \ @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity\n\
