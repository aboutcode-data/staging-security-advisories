aliases: []
summary: The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change in
  versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled
  access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over
  administrator accounts.
