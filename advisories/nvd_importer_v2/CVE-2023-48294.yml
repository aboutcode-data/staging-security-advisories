aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes
  support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. In affected versions of
  LibreNMS when a user accesses their device dashboard, one request is sent to `graph.php` to
  access graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be accessed by a low privilege
  user and they can enumerate devices on librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this
  vulnerability a low privilege user can see all devices registered by admin users. This vulnerability
  has been addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been included in release version 23.11.0.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
