summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  libceph: return the handler error from mon_handle_auth_done()

  Currently any error from ceph_auth_handle_reply_done() is propagated
  via finish_auth() but isn't returned from mon_handle_auth_done().  This
  results in higher layers learning that (despite the monitor considering
  us to be successfully authenticated) something went wrong in the
  authentication phase and reacting accordingly, but msgr2 still trying
  to proceed with establishing the session in the background.  In the
  case of secure mode this can trigger a WARN in setup_crypto() and later
  lead to a NULL pointer dereference inside of prepare_auth_signature().
