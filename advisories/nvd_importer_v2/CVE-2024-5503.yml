aliases: []
summary: The WP Blog Post Layouts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the
  server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass
  access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and
  other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
