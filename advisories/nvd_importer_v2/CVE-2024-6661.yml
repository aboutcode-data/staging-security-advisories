summary: The ParityPress – Parity Pricing with Discount Rules plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via  'Discount Text' in all versions up to, and including,
  1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
  affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
