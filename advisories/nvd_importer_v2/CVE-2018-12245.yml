summary: Symantec Endpoint Protection prior to 14.2 MP1 may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading
  vulnerability, which in this case is an issue that can occur when an application being installed
  unintentionally loads a DLL provided by a potential attacker. Note that this particular type
  of exploit only manifests at install time; no remediation is required for software that has
  already been installed. This issue only impacted the Trialware media for Symantec Endpoint
  Protection, which has since been updated.
