aliases: []
summary: Entrust Instant Financial Issuance (formerly known as Cardwizard) 6.10.0, 6.9.0, 6.9.1,
  6.9.2, and 6.8.x and earlier uses a DLL library (i.e. DCG.Security.dll) with a custom AES
  encryption process that relies on static hard-coded key values. These keys are not uniquely
  generated per installation of the software. Combined with the encrypted password that can
  be obtained from "WebAPI.cfg.xml" in CVE-2024-39341, the decryption is trivial and can lead
  to privilege escalation on the Windows host.
