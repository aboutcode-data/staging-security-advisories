aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Access Registrar
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting attack
  on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface
  does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker
  would need valid administrative credentials. Cisco expects to release software updates that
  address this vulnerability.
