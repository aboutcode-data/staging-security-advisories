aliases: []
summary: PrivateBin is an online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data.
  Versions 1.7.7 through 2.0.1 allow persistent HTML injection via the unsanitized attachment
  filename (attachment_name) when attachments are enabled. An attacker can modify attachment_name
  before encryption so that, after decryption, arbitrary HTML is inserted unescaped into the
  page near the file size hint, enabling redirect (e.g., meta refresh) and site defacement and
  related phishing attacks. Script execution is normally blocked by the recommended Content
  Security Policy, limiting confidentiality impact. The issue was introduced in 1.7.7 and fixed
  in 2.0.2. Update to 2.0.2 or later. Workarounds include enforcing the recommended CSP, deploying
  PrivateBin on a separate domain, or disabling attachments.
