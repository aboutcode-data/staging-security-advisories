aliases: []
summary: In FreeBSD 10.x before 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p3, and 10.3-RELEASE-p24 named paths
  are globally scoped, meaning a process located in one jail can read and modify the content
  of POSIX shared memory objects created by a process in another jail or the host system. As
  a result, a malicious user that has access to a jailed system is able to abuse shared memory
  by injecting malicious content in the shared memory region. This memory region might be executed
  by applications trusting the shared memory, like Squid. This issue could lead to a Denial
  of Service or local privilege escalation.
