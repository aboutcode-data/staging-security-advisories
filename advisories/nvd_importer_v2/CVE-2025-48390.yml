aliases: []
summary: FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.178,
  FreeScout is vulnerable to code injection due to insufficient validation of user input in
  the php_path parameter. The backticks characters are not removed, as well as tabulation is
  not removed. When checking user input, the file_exists function is also called to check for
  the presence of such a file (folder) in the file system. A user with the administrator role
  can create a translation for the language, which will create a folder in the file system.
  Further in tools.php, the user can specify the path to this folder as php_path, which will
  lead to the execution of code in backticks. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.178.
