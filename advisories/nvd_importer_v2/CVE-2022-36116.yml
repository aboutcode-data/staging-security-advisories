aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured
  environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated
  user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for the setValidationInfo
  administrative function. Removing the validation applied to newly designed processes increases
  the chance of successfully hiding malicious code that could be executed in a production environment.
