aliases: []
summary: A USB backdoor feature can be triggered by attaching a USB drive that contains specially
  crafted "salia.ini" files. The .ini file can contain several "commands" that could be exploited
  by an attacker to export or modify the device configuration, enable an SSH backdoor  or perform
  other administrative actions. Ultimately, this backdoor also allows arbitrary execution of
  OS commands.
