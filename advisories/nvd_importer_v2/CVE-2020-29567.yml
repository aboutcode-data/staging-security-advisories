aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. When moving IRQs between CPUs to distribute
  the load of IRQ handling, IRQ vectors are dynamically allocated and de-allocated on the relevant
  CPUs. De-allocation has to happen when certain constraints are met. If these conditions are
  not met when first checked, the checking CPU may send an interrupt to itself, in the expectation
  that this IRQ will be delivered only after the condition preventing the cleanup has cleared.
  For two specific IRQ vectors, this expectation was violated, resulting in a continuous stream
  of self-interrupts, which renders the CPU effectively unusable. A domain with a passed through
  PCI device can cause lockup of a physical CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
  entire host. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only guests
  with physical PCI devices passed through to them can exploit the vulnerability.
