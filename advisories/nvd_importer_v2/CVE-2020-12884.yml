aliases: []
summary: A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP
  parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options()
  parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a single packet. While processing
  the options, packet_data_pptr is accessed after being incremented by option_len without a
  prior out-of-bounds memory check. The temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is validated for a correct
  range, but the range valid for temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is derived from the amount of allocated
  heap memory, not the actual input size. Therefore the check of temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr may
  be insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by packet_data_pptr. As a result, access
  to a memory area outside of the intended boundary of the packet buffer is made.
