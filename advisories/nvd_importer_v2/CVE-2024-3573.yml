aliases: []
summary: mlflow/mlflow is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to improper parsing of
  URIs, allowing attackers to bypass checks and read arbitrary files on the system. The issue
  arises from the 'is_local_uri' function's failure to properly handle URIs with empty or 'file'
  schemes, leading to the misclassification of URIs as non-local. Attackers can exploit this
  by crafting malicious model versions with specially crafted 'source' parameters, enabling
  the reading of sensitive files within at least two directory levels from the server's root.
