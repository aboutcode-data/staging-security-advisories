aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read and delete files on an affected
  device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains certain character
  sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or
  delete specific files on the device that their configured administrative level should not
  have access to. Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability.
