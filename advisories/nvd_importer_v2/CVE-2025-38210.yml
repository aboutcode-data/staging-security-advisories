  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  configfs-tsm-report: Fix NULL dereference of tsm_ops

  Unlike sysfs, the lifetime of configfs objects is controlled by
  userspace. There is no mechanism for the kernel to find and delete all
  created config-items. Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an
  expectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause
  established config-item access to start failing.

  That expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),
  tsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail
  if tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()
  tsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the
  missing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.

  Now, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,
  it leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The
  expectation is that the admin that arranges for the ->remove() (unbind)
  of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all
  open config-items. Until that deletion happens, ->probe() (reload /
  bind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.

  This allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation
  interfaces, and requires coordinated restart.
