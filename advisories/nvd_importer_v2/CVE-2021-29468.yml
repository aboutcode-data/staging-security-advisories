summary: Cygwin Git is a patch set for the git command line tool for the cygwin environment.
  A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files with backslash
  characters in the file name may cause just-checked out code to be executed while checking
  out a repository using Git on Cygwin. The problem will be patched in the Cygwin Git v2.31.1-2
  release. At time of writing, the vulnerability is present in the upstream Git source code;
  any Cygwin user who compiles Git for themselves from upstream sources should manually apply
  a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. As mitigation users should not clone or pull from repositories
  from untrusted sources. CVE-2019-1354 was an equivalent vulnerability in Git for Visual Studio.
