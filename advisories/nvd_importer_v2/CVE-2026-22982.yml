  net: mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag

  Commit 15faa1f67ab4 ("lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag")
  fixed a similar issue in the lan966x driver caused by a NULL pointer dereference.
  The ocelot_set_aggr_pgids() function in the ocelot driver has similar logic
  and is susceptible to the same crash.

  This issue specifically affects the ocelot_vsc7514.c frontend, which leaves
  unused ports as NULL pointers. The felix_vsc9959.c frontend is unaffected as
  it uses the DSA framework which registers all ports.

  Fix this by checking if the port pointer is valid before accessing it.
