summary: The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.90. This is due to missing or incorrect

  to make changes to invoices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
