aliases: []
summary: "As a simple library, class.upload.php does not perform an in-depth check on uploaded\
  \ files, allowing a stored XSS vulnerability when the default configuration is used. \n\n\n\
  Developers must be aware of that fact and use extension whitelisting accompanied by forcing\
  \ the server to always provide content-type based on the file extension. \n\n\nThe README\
  \ has been updated to include these guidelines."
