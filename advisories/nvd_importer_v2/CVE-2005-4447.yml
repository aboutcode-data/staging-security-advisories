aliases: []
summary: 'SQL injection vulnerability in articles\articles_funcs.php in phpCOIN 1.2.2 allows
  remote attackers to modify SQL syntax and possibly execute SQL in limited circumstances via
  the rec_next parameter. NOTE: the original disclosure suggests that command injection is not
  feasible because the injection occurs after an "ORDER BY" clause, but it is likely that this
  bug could result in an error message path disclosure due to a syntax error, in some environments.  Therefore
  this is an exposure and should be included in CVE.'
