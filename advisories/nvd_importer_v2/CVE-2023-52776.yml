  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: ath12k: fix dfs-radar and temperature event locking

  The ath12k active pdevs are protected by RCU but the DFS-radar and
  temperature event handling code calling ath12k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id()
  was not marked as a read-side critical section.

  Mark the code in question as RCU read-side critical sections to avoid
  any potential use-after-free issues.

  Note that the temperature event handler looks like a place holder
  currently but would still trigger an RCU lockdep splat.

  Compile tested only.
