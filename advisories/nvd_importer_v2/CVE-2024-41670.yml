aliases: []
summary: In the module "PayPal Official" for PrestaShop 7+ releases prior to version 6.4.2 and
  for PrestaShop 1.6 releases prior to version 3.18.1, a malicious customer can confirm an order
  even if payment is finally declined by PayPal. A logical weakness during the capture of a
  payment in case of disabled webhooks can be exploited to create an accepted order. This could
  allow a threat actor to confirm an order with a fraudulent payment support. Versions 6.4.2
  and 3.18.1 contain a patch for the issue. Additionally, users enable webhooks and check they
  are callable.
