summary: The Fluent Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the form-submission.js script in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.2 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
