aliases: []
summary: Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.2.0075, a heap-based
  buffer underflow exists in Vim's Emacs-style tags file parsing logic. When processing a malformed
  tags file where a delimiter appears at the start of a line, Vim attempts to read memory immediately
  preceding the allocated buffer. Version 9.2.0075 fixes the issue.
