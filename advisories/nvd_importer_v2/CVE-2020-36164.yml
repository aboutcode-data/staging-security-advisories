aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Veritas Enterprise Vault through 14.0. On start-up, it
  loads the OpenSSL library. The OpenSSL library then attempts to load the openssl.cnf configuration
  file (which does not exist) at the following locations in both the System drive (typically
  C:\) and the product''s installation drive (typically not C:\): \Isode\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf
  (on SMTP Server) or \user\ssl\openssl.cnf (on other affected components). By default, on Windows
  systems, users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a openssl.cnf
  configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution
  as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system,
  allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications,
  etc. This vulnerability only affects a server with MTP Server, SMTP Archiving IMAP Server,
  IMAP Archiving, Vault Cloud Adapter, NetApp File server, or File System Archiving for NetApp
  as File Server.'
