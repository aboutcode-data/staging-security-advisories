  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hwmon: (coretemp) Simplify platform device handling

  Coretemp's platform driver is unconventional. All the real work is done
  globally by the initcall and CPU hotplug notifiers, while the "driver"
  effectively just wraps an allocation and the registration of the hwmon
  interface in a long-winded round-trip through the driver core.  The whole
  logic of dynamically creating and destroying platform devices to bring
  the interfaces up and down is error prone, since it assumes
  platform_device_add() will synchronously bind the driver and set drvdata
  before it returns, thus results in a NULL dereference if drivers_autoprobe
  is turned off for the platform bus. Furthermore, the unusual approach of
  doing that from within a CPU hotplug notifier, already commented in the
  code that it deadlocks suspend, also causes lockdep issues for other
  drivers or subsystems which may want to legitimately register a CPU
  hotplug notifier from a platform bus notifier.

  All of these issues can be solved by ripping this unusual behaviour out
  completely, simply tying the platform devices to the lifetime of the
  module itself, and directly managing the hwmon interfaces from the
  hotplug notifiers. There is a slight user-visible change in that
  /sys/bus/platform/drivers/coretemp will no longer appear, and
  /sys/devices/platform/coretemp.n will remain present if package n is
  hotplugged off, but hwmon users should really only be looking for the
  presence of the hwmon interfaces, whose behaviour remains unchanged.
