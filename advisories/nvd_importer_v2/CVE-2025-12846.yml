aliases: []
summary: The Blocksy Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary
  file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.19. This is due to insufficient file
  type validation detecting SVG files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization
  while being accepted as a valid SVG file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with author level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
