aliases: []
summary: In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, a crafted
  TFLite model can force a node to have as input a tensor backed by a `nullptr` buffer. This
  can be achieved by changing a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only
  tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to before a
  possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`. However, by changing the buffer
  index for a tensor and implicitly converting that tensor to be a read-write one, as there
  is nothing in the model that writes to it, we get a null pointer dereference. The issue is
  patched in commit 0b5662bc, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1,
  or 2.3.1.
