aliases: []
summary: RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network
  stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can
  send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a large out of bounds write beyond the packet
  buffer. The write will create a hard fault exception after reaching the last page of RAM.
  The hard fault is not handled and the system will be stuck until reset, thus the impact is
  denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, disable support for
  fragmented IP datagrams or apply the patches manually.
