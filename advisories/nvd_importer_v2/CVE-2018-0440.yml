summary: A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager could allow
  an authenticated application administrator to execute commands on the underlying operating
  system with root-level privileges. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation
  of user input within an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
  to the application and then sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted application. A
  successful exploit could allow the authenticated attacker to issue commands on the underlying
  operating system as the root user.
