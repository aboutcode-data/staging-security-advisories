aliases: []
summary: DeepChat is a smart assistant uses artificial intelligence. Prior to version 0.3.5,
  in the Mermaid chart rendering component, there is a risky operation of directly using `innerHTML`
  to set user content. Therefore, any malicious content rendered via Mermaid will directly trigger
  the exploit chain, leading to command execution. This vulnerability is primarily caused by
  a failure to fully address the existing XSS issue in the project, leading to another exploit
  chain. The exploit chain is consistent with the report GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j, executing arbitrary
  JavaScript code via XSS and arbitrary commands via exposed IPC. Version 0.3.5 contains an
  updated fix.
