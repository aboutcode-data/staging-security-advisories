aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. This vulnerability allows
  the attacker to predict a DNS query's source port in order to send forged DNS response packets
  that will be accepted as valid answers to the DNS client's requests (without sniffing the
  specific request). Data is predictable because it is based on the time of day, and has too
  few bits.
