aliases: []
summary: vertaai/modeldb is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to improper sanitization
  of user-supplied file paths in its file upload functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability
  to write arbitrary files anywhere in the file system by manipulating the 'artifact_path' parameter.
  This flaw can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting critical files, such as the
  application's configuration file, especially when the application is run outside of Docker.
  The vulnerability is present in the NFSController.java and NFSService.java components of the
  application.
