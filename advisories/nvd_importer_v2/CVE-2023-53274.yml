  clk: mediatek: mt8183: Add back SSPM related clocks

  This reverts commit 860690a93ef23b567f781c1b631623e27190f101.

  On the MT8183, the SSPM related clocks were removed claiming a lack of
  usage. This however causes some issues when the driver was converted to
  the new simple-probe mechanism. This mechanism allocates enough space
  for all the clocks defined in the clock driver, not the highest index
  in the DT binding. This leads to out-of-bound writes if their are holes
  in the DT binding or the driver (due to deprecated or unimplemented
  clocks). These errors can go unnoticed and cause memory corruption,
  leading to crashes in unrelated areas, or nothing at all. KASAN will
  detect them.

  Add the SSPM related clocks back to the MT8183 clock driver to fully
  implement the DT binding. The SSPM clocks are for the power management
  co-processor, and should never be turned off. They are marked as such.
