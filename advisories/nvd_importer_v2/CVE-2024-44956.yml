  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe/preempt_fence: enlarge the fence critical section

  It is really easy to introduce subtle deadlocks in
  preempt_fence_work_func() since we operate on single global ordered-wq
  for signalling our preempt fences behind the scenes, so even though we
  signal a particular fence, everything in the callback should be in the
  fence critical section, since blocking in the callback will prevent
  other published fences from signalling. If we enlarge the fence critical
  section to cover the entire callback, then lockdep should be able to
  understand this better, and complain if we grab a sensitive lock like
  vm->lock, which is also held when waiting on preempt fences.
