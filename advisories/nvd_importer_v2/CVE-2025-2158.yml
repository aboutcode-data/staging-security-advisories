summary: 'The WordPress Review Plugin: The Ultimate Solution for Building a Review Website plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including,
  5.3.5 via the Post custom fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server,
  allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,
  obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where PHP file types can be uploaded
  and included, or pearcmd is enabled on a server with register_argc_argv also enabled.'
