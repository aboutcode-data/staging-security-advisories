summary: A vulnerability in the shell access request mechanism of Cisco IOS XE Software could
  allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass authentication and gain unrestricted access
  to the root shell of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software
  has insufficient authentication mechanisms for certain commands. An attacker could exploit
