aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an
  authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute commands with higher privileges.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of the System Operator role capabilities.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with the System Operator role,
  performing a series of actions, and then assuming a new higher privileged role. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to perform all actions associated with the privilege of the
  assumed role. If that role is an administrative role, the attacker would gain full access
  to the device.
