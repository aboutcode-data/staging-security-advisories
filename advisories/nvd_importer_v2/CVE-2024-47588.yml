aliases: []
summary: In SAP NetWeaver Java (Software Update Manager 1.1), under certain conditions when
  a software upgrade encounters errors, credentials are written in plaintext to a log file.
  An attacker with local access to the server, authenticated as a non-administrative user, can
  acquire the credentials from the logs. This leads to a high impact on confidentiality, with
  no impact on integrity or availability.
