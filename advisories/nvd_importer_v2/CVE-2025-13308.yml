aliases: []
summary: 'The Application Passwords plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting via the ''reject_url'' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.3. This
  is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied URLs, which
  allows javascript: URI schemes to be embedded in the reject_url parameter. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when a user clicks
  the "No, I do not approve of this connection" button, granted they can successfully trick
  the victim into performing an action such as clicking on a link.'
