aliases: []
summary: Users were able to set an arbitrary "product name" for OX Guard. The chosen value was
  not sufficiently sanitized before processing it at the user interface, allowing for indirect
  cross-site scripting attacks. Accounts that were temporarily taken over could be configured
  to trigger persistent code execution, allowing an attacker to build a foothold. Sanitization
  is in place for product names now. No publicly available exploits are known.
