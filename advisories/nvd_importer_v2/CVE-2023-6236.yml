aliases: []
summary: "A flaw was found in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 8. When an OIDC app that\
  \ serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user\
  \ to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration.\
  \ The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should\
  \ be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new \"provider-url\"\
  \ option in addition to the \"realm\" option.\r\n\r\nEAP-7 does not provide the vulnerable\
  \ provider-url configuration option in its OIDC implementation and is not affected by this\
  \ flaw."
