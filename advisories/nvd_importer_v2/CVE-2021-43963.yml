summary: An issue was discovered in Couchbase Sync Gateway 2.7.0 through 2.8.2. The bucket credentials
  used to read and write data in Couchbase Server were insecurely being stored in the metadata
  within sync documents written to the bucket. Users with read access could use these credentials
  to obtain write access. (This issue does not affect clusters where Sync Gateway is authenticated
  with X.509 client certificates. This issue also does not affect clusters where shared bucket
  access is not enabled on Sync Gateway.)
