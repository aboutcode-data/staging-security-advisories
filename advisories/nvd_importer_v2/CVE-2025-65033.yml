aliases: []
summary: Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4,
  an authorization flaw in the poll management feature allows any authenticated user to pause
  or resume any poll, regardless of ownership. The system only uses the public pollId to identify
  polls, and it does not verify whether the user performing the action is the poll owner. As
  a result, any user can disrupt polls created by others, leading to a loss of integrity and
  availability across the application. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.
