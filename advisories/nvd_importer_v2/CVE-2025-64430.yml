aliases: []
summary: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that
  can run Node.js. In versions 4.2.0 through 7.5.3, and 8.0.0 through 8.3.1-alpha.1, there is
  a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the file upload functionality when trying
  to upload a Parse.File with uri parameter, allowing execution of an arbitrary URI. The vulnerability
  stems from a file upload feature in which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI
  that is provided in the request. A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response
  is not stored in Parse Server's file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response.
  This issue is fixed in versions 7.5.4 and 8.4.0-alpha.1.
