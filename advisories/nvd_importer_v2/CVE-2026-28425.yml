aliases: []
summary: Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to versions
  5.73.11 and 6.4.0, an authenticated control panel user with access to Antlers-enabled inputs
  may be able to achieve remote code execution in the application context. That can lead to
  full compromise of the application, including access to sensitive configuration, modification
  or exfiltration of data, and potential impact on availability. Exploitation is only possible
  where Antlers runs on user-controlled content—for example, content fields with Antlers explicitly
  enabled (requiring permission to configure fields and to edit entries), built-in config that
  supports Antlers such as Forms email notification settings (requiring configuration permission),
  or third-party addons that add Antlers-enabled fields to entries (for example, the SEO Pro
  addon). In each case the attacker must have the relevant control panel permissions. This has
  been fixed in 5.73.11 and 6.4.0. Users of addons that depend on Statamic should ensure that
  after updating they are running a patched Statamic version.
