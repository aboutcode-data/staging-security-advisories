aliases: []
summary: The Nonaki – Drag and Drop Email Template builder and Newsletter plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'nonaki' shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 1.0.11. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  on user supplied custom field values that are retrieved and rendered by the shortcode. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
