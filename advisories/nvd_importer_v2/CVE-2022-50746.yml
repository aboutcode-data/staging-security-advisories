  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  erofs: validate the extent length for uncompressed pclusters

  syzkaller reported a KASAN use-after-free:
  https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=2ae90e873e97f1faf6f2

  The referenced fuzzed image actually has two issues:
   - m_pa == 0 as a non-inlined pcluster;
   - The logical length is longer than its physical length.

  The first issue has already been addressed.  This patch addresses
  the second issue by checking the extent length validity.
