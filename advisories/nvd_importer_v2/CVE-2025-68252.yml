  misc: fastrpc: Fix dma_buf object leak in fastrpc_map_lookup

  In fastrpc_map_lookup, dma_buf_get is called to obtain a reference to
  the dma_buf for comparison purposes. However, this reference is never
  released when the function returns, leading to a dma_buf memory leak.

  Fix this by adding dma_buf_put before returning from the function,
  ensuring that the temporarily acquired reference is properly released
  regardless of whether a matching map is found.

  Rule: add
