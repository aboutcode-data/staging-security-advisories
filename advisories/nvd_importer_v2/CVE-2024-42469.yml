aliases: []
summary: openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including
  the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, CometVisu's file system endpoints
  don't require authentication and additionally the endpoint to update an existing file is susceptible
  to path traversal. This makes it possible for an attacker to overwrite existing files on the
  openHAB instance. If the overwritten file is a shell script that is executed at a later time,
  this vulnerability can allow remote code execution by an attacker. Users should upgrade to
  version 4.2.1 to receive a patch.
