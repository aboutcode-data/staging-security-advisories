aliases: []
summary: "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform provides functionality to upload\
  \ various types of files. However, the Java code handling file uploads contains an argument\
  \ injection vulnerability. By appending additional arguments to the file name, an attacker\
  \ can bypass MIME type validation, allowing the upload of arbitrary file types. This flaw\
  \ can be exploited to place a malicious file on disk. \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware\
  \ of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this\
  \ vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nThere are\
  \ no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to\
  \ one of the remediated software versions."
