aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the K7RKScan.sys driver, part of the K7 Security Anti-Malware suite,
  allows a local low-privilege user to send crafted IOCTL requests to terminate a wide range
  of processes running with administrative or system-level privileges, with the exception of
  those inherently protected by the operating system. This flaw stems from missing access control
  in the driver's IOCTL handler, enabling unprivileged users to perform privileged actions in
  kernel space. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service by disrupting critical
  services or privileged applications.
