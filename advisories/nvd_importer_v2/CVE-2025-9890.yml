summary: The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  achieve remote code execution via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
