aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the boot process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker with high privileges to bypass the Secure Boot functionality and load unverified\
  \ software on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have root-system\
  \ privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient verification\
  \ of modules in the software load process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\
  \ manipulating the loaded binaries to bypass some of the integrity checks that are performed\
  \ during the booting process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to control the\
  \ boot configuration, which could enable them to bypass the requirement to run Cisco-signed\
  \ images or alter the security properties of the running system.\r\nNote: This vulnerability\
  \ affects Cisco IOS XR Software, not the Secure Boot feature.\r\nCisco has released software\
  \ updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
