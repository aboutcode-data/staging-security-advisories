aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open source team chat server. In affected versions Zulip allows organization
  administrators on a server to configure "linkifiers" that automatically create links from
  messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization
  administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity
  attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and
  sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided
  regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as
  _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex
  invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release),
  or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).
