summary: The OneClick Chat to Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object
  Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 via the 'wa_order_thank_you_override'
  function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to view sensitive customer information including names, email addresses, phone numbers,
  billing/shipping addresses, order contents, and payment methods by simply changing the order
  ID in the URL.
