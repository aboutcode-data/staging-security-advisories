aliases: []
summary: '@octokit/request-error is an error class for Octokit request errors. Starting in version
  1.0.0 and prior to version 6.1.7, a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability
  exists in the processing of HTTP request headers. By sending an authorization header containing
  an excessively long sequence of spaces followed by a newline and "@", an attacker can exploit
  inefficient regular expression processing, leading to excessive resource consumption. This
  can significantly degrade server performance or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition,
  impacting availability. Version 6.1.7 contains a fix for the issue.'
