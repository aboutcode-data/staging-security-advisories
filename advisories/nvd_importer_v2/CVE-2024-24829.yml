aliases: []
summary: 'Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Sentry’s integration
  platform provides a way for external services to interact with Sentry. One of such integrations,
  the Phabricator integration (maintained by Sentry) with version <=24.1.1 contains a constrained
  SSRF vulnerability. An attacker could make Sentry send POST HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs
  (including internal IP addresses) by providing an unsanitized input to the Phabricator integration.
  However, the body payload is constrained to a specific format. If an attacker has access to
  a Sentry instance, this allows them to: 1. interact with internal network; 2. scan local/remote
  ports. This issue has been fixed in Sentry self-hosted release 24.1.2, and has already been
  mitigated on sentry.io on February 8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.'
