aliases: []
summary: The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cache
  Poisoning in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.48. This is due to the plugin not serving
  cached data from server-side responses and instead relying on user-input. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to poison the cache location for location search results.
