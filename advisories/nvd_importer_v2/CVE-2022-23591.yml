summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow
  does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied.
  However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading
  a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef`
  means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow
  2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
