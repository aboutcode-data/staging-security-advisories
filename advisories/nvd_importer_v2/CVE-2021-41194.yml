aliases: []
summary: FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new users set their
  password on their first login to JupyterHub. When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator,
  a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's account
  if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to version 1.0.0
  or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there
  is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation
  with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully
  normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator
  1.0.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase),
  they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs.
