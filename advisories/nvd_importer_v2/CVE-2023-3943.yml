summary: "Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in ZkTeco-based OEM devices allows, in some\
  \ cases, the execution of arbitrary code. Due to the lack of protection mechanisms such as\
  \ stack canaries and PIE, it is possible to successfully execute code even under restrictive\
  \ conditions.\n\nThis issue affects \nZkTeco-based OEM devices (ZkTeco ProFace X, Smartec\
  \ ST-FR043, Smartec ST-FR041ME and possibly others)\n\n with firmware \nZAM170-NF-1.8.25-7354-Ver1.0.0\
  \ and possibly others."
