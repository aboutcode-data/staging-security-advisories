aliases: []
summary: fast-jwt provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to 5.0.6, the fast-jwt
  library does not properly validate the iss claim based on the RFC 7519. The iss (issuer) claim
  validation within the fast-jwt library permits an array of strings as a valid iss value. This
  design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a JWT with an iss claim
  structured as ['https://attacker-domain/', 'https://valid-iss']. Due to the permissive validation,
  the JWT will be deemed valid. Furthermore, if the application relies on external libraries
  like get-jwks that do not independently validate the iss claim, the attacker can leverage
  this vulnerability to forge a JWT that will be accepted by the victim application. Essentially,
  the attacker can insert their own domain into the iss array, alongside the legitimate issuer,
  and bypass the intended security checks. This issue is fixed in 5.0.6.
