aliases: []
summary: Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. In versions of gogs prior to 0.12.9
  `DisplayName` does not filter characters input from users, which leads to an XSS vulnerability
  when directly displayed in the issue list. This issue has been resolved in commit 155cae1d
  which sanitizes `DisplayName` prior to display to the user. All users of gogs are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check their users' display names for malicious
  characters.
