  Bluetooth: MGMT: cancel mesh send timer when hdev removed

  mesh_send_done timer is not canceled when hdev is removed, which causes
  crash if the timer triggers after hdev is gone.

  Cancel the timer when MGMT removes the hdev, like other MGMT timers.

  Should fix the BUG: sporadically seen by BlueZ test bot
  (in "Mesh - Send cancel - 1" test).
