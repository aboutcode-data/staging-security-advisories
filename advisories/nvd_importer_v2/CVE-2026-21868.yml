summary: Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. Versions 2.3.2 and below have a Regular
  Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the user profile API endpoint (/api/user/[username]).
  The application constructs a regular expression dynamically using unescaped user input (the
  username parameter). An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted username
  containing regex meta-characters (e.g., deeply nested groups or quantifiers), causing the
  MongoDB regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to Denial of Service
  for other users. The issue is fixed in version 2.3.3. To workaround this issue, implement
  a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to block requests containing regex meta-characters in
  the URL path.
