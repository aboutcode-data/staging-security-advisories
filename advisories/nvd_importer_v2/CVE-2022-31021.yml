aliases: []
summary: Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. A weakness in the Hyperledger
  AnonCreds specification that is not mitigated in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations is
  that the Issuer does not publish a key correctness proof demonstrating that a generated private
  key is sufficient to meet the unlinkability guarantees of AnonCreds. The Ursa and AnonCreds
  CL-Signatures implementations always generate a sufficient private key. A malicious issuer
  could in theory create a custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds
  CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such that presentations from
  holders could be shared by verifiers to the issuer who could determine the holder to which
  the credential was issued. This vulnerability could impact holders of AnonCreds credentials
  implemented using the CL-signature scheme in the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations of CL
  Signatures. The ursa project has has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.
