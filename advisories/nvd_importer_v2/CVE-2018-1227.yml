aliases: []
summary: Pivotal Concourse after 2018-03-05 might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified
  impact, if a customer obtained the Concourse software from a DNS domain that is no longer
  controlled by Pivotal. The original domain for the Concourse CI (concourse-dot-ci) open source
  project has been registered by an unknown actor, and is therefore no longer the official website
  for Concourse CI. The new official domain is concourse-ci.org. At approximately 4 am EDT on
  March 7, 2018 the Concourse OSS team began receiving reports that the Concourse domain was
  not responding. The Concourse OSS team discovered, upon investigation with both the original
  and the new domain registrars, that the originating domain registrar had made the domain available
  for purchase. This was done despite the domain being renewed by the Concourse OSS team through
  August 2018. For a customer to be affected, they would have needed to access a download from
  a "concourse-dot-ci" domain web site after March 6, 2018 18:00:00 EST. Accessing that domain
  is NOT recommended by Pivotal. Anyone who had been using that domain should immediately begin
  using the concourse-ci.org domain instead. Customers can also safely access Concourse software
  from the traditionally available locations on the Pivotal Network or GitHub.
