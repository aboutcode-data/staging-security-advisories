aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0xB2) allows a local attacker
  to control both the read and write addresses used by the CommandRcx1 function. The write target
  is derived from an unvalidated UEFI NVRAM variable (SetupXtuBufferAddress), while the write
  content is read from an attacker-controlled pointer based on the RBX register. This dual-pointer
  dereference enables arbitrary memory writes within System Management RAM (SMRAM), leading
  to potential SMM privilege escalation and firmware compromise.
