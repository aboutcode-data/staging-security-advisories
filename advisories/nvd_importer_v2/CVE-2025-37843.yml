  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI: pciehp: Avoid unnecessary device replacement check

  Hot-removal of nested PCI hotplug ports suffers from a long-standing race
  condition which can lead to a deadlock:  A parent hotplug port acquires
  pci_lock_rescan_remove(), then waits for pciehp to unbind from a child
  hotplug port.  Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire
  pci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.

  The deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()
  first, not if the child happens to acquire it first.

  Several workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded
  over the years, e.g.:

  https://lore.kernel.org/r/4c882e25194ba8282b78fe963fec8faae7cf23eb.1529173804.git.lukas@wunner.de/

  A proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial
  and necessarily intrusive.

  Recent commit 9d573d19547b ("PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during
  system sleep") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when
  removing more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit
  sought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.
  Differentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible
  because pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as
  if it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.

  Avoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the
  hotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking
  whether its child device was replaced.

  This works because the ->resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down
  order for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device
  replacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using
  pci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably
  detect being removed.
