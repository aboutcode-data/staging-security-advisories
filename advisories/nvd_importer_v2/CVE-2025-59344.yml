aliases: []
summary: AliasVault is a privacy-first password manager with built-in email aliasing. A server-side
  request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the favicon extraction feature of AliasVault
  API versions 0.23.0 and lower. The extractor fetches a user-supplied URL, parses the returned
  HTML, and follows <link rel="icon" href="…">. Although the initial URL is validated to allow
  only HTTP/HTTPS with default ports, the extractor automatically follows redirects and does
  not block requests to loopback or internal IP ranges. An authenticated, low-privileged user
  can exploit this behavior to coerce the backend into making HTTP(S) requests to arbitrary
  internal hosts and non-default ports. If the target host serves a favicon or any other valid
  image, the response is returned to the attacker in Base64 form. Even when no data is returned,
  timing and error behavior can be abused to map internal services. This vulnerability only
  affects self-hosted AliasVault instances that are reachable from the public internet with
  public user registration enabled. Private/internal deployments without public sign-ups are
  not directly exploitable. This issue has been fixed in AliasVault release 0.23.1.
