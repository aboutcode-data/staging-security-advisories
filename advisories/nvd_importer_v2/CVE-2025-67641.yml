aliases: []
summary: Jenkins Coverage Plugin 2.3054.ve1ff7b_a_a_123b_ and earlier does not validate the
  configured coverage results ID when creating coverage results, only when submitting the job
  configuration through the UI, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permission to use a `javascript:`
  scheme URL as identifier by configuring the job through the REST API, resulting in a stored
  cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
