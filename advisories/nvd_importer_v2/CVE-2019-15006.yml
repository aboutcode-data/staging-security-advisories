aliases: []
summary: There was a man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability present in the Confluence Previews
  plugin in Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. This plugin was used to facilitate
  communication with the Atlassian Companion application. The Confluence Previews plugin in
  Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center communicated with the Companion application via
  the atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com domain name, the DNS A record of which
  points at 127.0.0.1. Additionally, a signed certificate for the domain was publicly distributed
  with the Companion application. An attacker in the position to control DNS resolution of their
  victim could carry out a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between Confluence Server (or Confluence
  Data Center) and the atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com domain intended to
  be used with the Companion application. This certificate has been revoked, however, usage
  of the atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com domain name was still present in
  Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. An attacker could perform the described attack
  by denying their victim access to certificate revocation information, and carry out a man-in-the-middle
  (MITM) attack to observe files being edited using the Companion application and/or modify
  them, and access some limited user information.
