aliases: []
summary: The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in
  versions up to, and including, 5.2.1.0. This is due to insufficient verification on the user
  being supplied during a Google social login through the plugin. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they have access to the email.
