aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Instances
  relying on an allow-listed reset URL are vulnerable to an HTML injection attack through the
  use of query parameters in the reset URL. An attacker could exploit this to email users urls
  to the servers domain but which may contain malicious code. The problem has been resolved
  and released under version 9.23.0. People relying on a custom password reset URL should upgrade
  to 9.23.0 or later, or remove the custom reset url from the configured allow list. Users are
  advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the custom reset URL allow list as
  a workaround.
