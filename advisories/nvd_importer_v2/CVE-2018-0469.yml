summary: A vulnerability in the web user interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to a double-free-in-memory
  handling by the affected software when specific HTTP requests are processed. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending specific HTTP requests to the web user interface of
  the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected
