aliases: []
summary: 'Persistent XSS in /course/modedit.php of Moodle through 3.7.2 allows authenticated
  users (Teacher and above) to inject JavaScript into the session of another user (e.g., enrolled
  student or site administrator) via the introeditor[text] parameter. NOTE: the discoverer and
  vendor disagree on whether Moodle customers have a reasonable expectation that anyone authenticated
  as a Teacher can be trusted with the ability to add arbitrary JavaScript (this ability is
  not documented on Moodle''s Teacher_role page). Because the vendor has this expectation, they
  have stated "this report has been closed as a false positive, and not a bug."'
