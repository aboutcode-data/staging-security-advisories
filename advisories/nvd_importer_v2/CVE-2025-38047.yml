  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/fred: Fix system hang during S4 resume with FRED enabled

  Upon a wakeup from S4, the restore kernel starts and initializes the
  FRED MSRs as needed from its perspective.  It then loads a hibernation
  image, including the image kernel, and attempts to load image pages
  directly into their original page frames used before hibernation unless
  those frames are currently in use.  Once all pages are moved to their
  original locations, it jumps to a "trampoline" page in the image kernel.

  At this point, the image kernel takes control, but the FRED MSRs still
  contain values set by the restore kernel, which may differ from those
  set by the image kernel before hibernation.  Therefore, the image kernel
  must ensure the FRED MSRs have the same values as before hibernation.
  Since these values depend only on the location of the kernel text and
  data, they can be recomputed from scratch.
