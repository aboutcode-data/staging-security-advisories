aliases: []
summary: Homarr is an open-source dashboard. Prior to version 1.43.3, stored XSS vulnerability
  exists, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, with minimal or
  no user interaction required, due to the rendering of a malicious uploaded SVG file. This
  could be abused to add an attacker's account to the "credentials-admin" group, giving them
  full administrative access, if a user logged in as an administrator was to view the page which
  renders or redirects to the SVG. This issue has been patched in version 1.43.3.
