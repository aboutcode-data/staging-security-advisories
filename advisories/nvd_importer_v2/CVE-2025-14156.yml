aliases: []
summary: The Fox LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5.1. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating the 'role' parameter when creating new users via the `/fox-lms/v1/payments/create-order`
  REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new user
  accounts with arbitrary roles, including administrator, leading to complete site compromise.
