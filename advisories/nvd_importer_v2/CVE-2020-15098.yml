aliases: []
summary: In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and greater than
  or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, it has been discovered that an internal verification
  mechanism can be used to generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data
  having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various
  attack chains including potential privilege escalation, insecure deserialization & remote
  code execution. The overall severity of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned attack
  chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated). This has
  been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.
