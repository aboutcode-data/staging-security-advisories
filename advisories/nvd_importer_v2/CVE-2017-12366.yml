summary: 'A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meeting Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of an affected system.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed
  to the web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user request and injecting
  malicious code into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to
  access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf78635,, CSCvg52440.'
