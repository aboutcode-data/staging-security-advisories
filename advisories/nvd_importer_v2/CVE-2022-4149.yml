aliases: []
summary: The Netskope client service (prior to R96) on Windows runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM which
  writes log files to a writable directory (C:\Users\Public\netSkope) for a standard user. The
  files are created and written with a SYSTEM account except one file (logplaceholder) which
  inherits permission giving all users full access control list. Netskope client restricts access
  to this file by allowing only read permissions as a standard user. Whenever the Netskope client
  service restarts, it deletes the logplaceholder and recreates, creating a race condition,
  which can be exploited by a malicious local user to create the file and set ACL permissions
  on the file. Once the file is created by a malicious user with proper ACL permissions, all
  files within C:\Users\Public\netSkope\ becomes modifiable by the unprivileged user. By using
  Windows pseudo-symlink, these files can be pointed to other places in the system and thus
  malicious users will be able to elevate privileges.
