aliases: []
summary: discourse-encrypt is a plugin that provides a secure communication channel through
  Discourse. Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles could lead to a cross site scripting
  (XSS) issue when a site has content security policy (CSP) headers disabled. Having CSP disabled
  is a non-default configuration, and having it disabled with discourse-encrypt installed will
  result in a warning in the Discourse admin dashboard. This has been fixed in commit `9c75810af9`
  which is included in the latest version of the discourse-encrypt plugin. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that CSP headers are enabled and properly
  configured.
