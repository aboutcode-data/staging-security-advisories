datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-3559
aliases: []
summary: 'main/streams/plain_wrapper.c in PHP 5.3.x before 5.3.1 does not recognize the safe_mode_include_dir
  directive, which allows context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact by triggering
  the failure of PHP scripts that perform include or require operations, as demonstrated by
  a script that attempts to perform a require_once on a file in a standard library directory.
  NOTE: a reliable third party reports that this is not a vulnerability, because it results
  in a more restrictive security policy.'
