  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fbcon: Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released

  Recently, we discovered the following issue through syzkaller:

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in fb_mode_is_equal+0x285/0x2f0

  Based on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,
  only the memory of fb_info->modelist is freed, without setting the
  corresponding fb_display[i]->mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads
  to UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction
  steps:
  1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module
     to register a new device /dev/fb1;
  2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);
  3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);
  4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving
     a wild pointer in fb_display[];
  5. Trigger the bug via system calls through fb0 attempting to delete a mode
     from fb0.

  Add a check in do_unregister_framebuffer(): if the mode to be freed exists
  in fb_display[], set the corresponding mode pointer to NULL.
