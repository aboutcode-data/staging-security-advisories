aliases: []
summary: phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8
  expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4
  to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes
  the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as
  the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where
  an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push
  malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository
  may be affected, but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run,
  limiting the time during which exploitation could occur. Version 4.1.8 fixes the issue.
