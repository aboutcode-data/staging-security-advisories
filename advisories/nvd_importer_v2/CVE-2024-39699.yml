summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. There
  was already a reported SSRF vulnerability via file import. It was fixed by resolving all DNS
  names and checking if the requested IP is an internal IP address. However it is possible to
  bypass this security measure and execute a SSRF using redirects. Directus allows redirects
  when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to
  execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF,
  because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the
  connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 10.9.3.
