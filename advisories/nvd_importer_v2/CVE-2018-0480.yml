aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the errdisable per VLAN feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow
  an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the device to crash, leading to a denial of
  service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a race condition that occurs when the
  VLAN and port enter an errdisabled state, resulting in an incorrect state in the software.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending frames that trigger the errdisable
  condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash,
  leading to a DoS condition.
