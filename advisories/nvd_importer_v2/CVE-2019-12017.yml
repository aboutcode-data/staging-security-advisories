aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in MapR CLDB code, specifically in the
  JSON framework that is used in the CLDB code that handles login and ticket issuance. An attacker
  can use the 'class' property of the JSON request sent to the CLDB to influence the JSON library's
  decision on which Java class this JSON request is deserialized to. By doing so, the attacker
  can force the MapR CLDB to construct a URLClassLoader which loads a malicious Java class from
  a remote path and instantiate this object in the MapR CLDB, thus executing arbitrary code
  on the machine running the MapR CLDB and take over the cluster. By switching to the newer
  Jackson library and ensuring that all incoming JSON requests are only deserialized to the
  same class that it was serialized from, the vulnerability is fixed. This vulnerability affects
  the entire MapR core platform.
