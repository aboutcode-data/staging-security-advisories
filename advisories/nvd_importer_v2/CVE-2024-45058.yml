aliases: []
summary: i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school
  secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker
  with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user
  type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted
  POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter.
  The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`,
  which does not check the user's current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e
  contains a patch for the issue.
