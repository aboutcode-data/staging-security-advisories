aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev27. The "defer"
  servlet offers to redirect a client to a specified URL. Since some checks were missing, arbitrary
  URLs could be provided as redirection target. Users can be tricked to follow a link to a trustworthy
  domain but end up at an unexpected service later on. This vulnerability can be used to prepare
  and enhance phishing attacks.
