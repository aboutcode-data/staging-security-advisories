aliases: []
summary: dicourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform which adds the ability
  to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic. Improper escaping of event titles
  could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) within the 'email preview' UI when a site has CSP
  disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, so the vast majority of sites
  are unaffected. This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure CSP is enabled on the
  forum.
