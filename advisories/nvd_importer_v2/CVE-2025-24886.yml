aliases: []
summary: pwn.college is an education platform to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity
  concepts in a hands-on fashion. Incorrect symlink checks on user specified dojos allows for
  users (admin not required) to perform an LFI from the CTFd container. When a user clones or
  updates repositories, a check is performed to see if the repository had contained any symlinks.
  A malicious user could craft a repository with symlinks pointed to sensitive files and then
  retrieve them using the CTFd website.
