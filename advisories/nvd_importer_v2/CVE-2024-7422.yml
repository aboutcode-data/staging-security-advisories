aliases: []
summary: The Theme My Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 7.1.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the tml_admin_save_ms_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update the theme's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note that this only affects multi-site
  instances.
