aliases: []
summary: The Redirection for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
  Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4 via deserialization of untrusted input
  in the delete_associated_files function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject a PHP Object. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when
  a form is present on the site with a file upload action, and doesn't affect sites with PHP
  version > 8. This vulnerability also requires the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension
  - Create Post' extension to be installed and activated in order to be exploited. No known
  POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact
  unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain
  is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow
  the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code depending on the POP chain present. We confirmed there is a usable gadget in Contact
  Form 7 plugin that makes arbitrary file deletion possible when installed with this plugin.
  Given Contact Form 7 is a requirement of this plugin, it is likely that any site with this
  plugin and the 'Redirection For Contact Form 7 Extension - Create Post' extension enabled
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion.
