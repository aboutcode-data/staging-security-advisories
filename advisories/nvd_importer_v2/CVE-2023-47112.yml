aliases: []
summary: Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools
  and a WebAPI. In affected versions access to two URLs used in both Rundeck Open Source and
  Process Automation products could allow authenticated users to access the URL path, which
  provides a list of job names and groups for any project, without the necessary authorization
  checks. The output of these endpoints only exposes the name of job groups and the jobs contained
  within the specified project. The output is read-only and the access does not allow changes
  to the information. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.17.3. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may block access to the two URLs used in either Rundeck
  Open Source or Process Automation products at a load balancer level.
