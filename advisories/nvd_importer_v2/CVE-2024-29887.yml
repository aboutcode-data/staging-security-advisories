aliases: []
summary: Serverpod is an app and web server, built for the Flutter and Dart ecosystem. This
  bug bypassed the validation of TSL certificates on all none web HTTP clients in the `serverpod_client`
  package. Making them susceptible to a man in the middle attack against encrypted traffic between
  the client device and the server. An attacker would need to be able to intercept the traffic
  and highjack the connection to the server for this vulnerability to be used. Upgrading to
  version `1.2.6` resolves this issue.
