aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in REDCap 14.9.6. It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 CSRF
  issue in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert
  configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an HTML injection payload
  in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to
  view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout
  request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability
  stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality.
