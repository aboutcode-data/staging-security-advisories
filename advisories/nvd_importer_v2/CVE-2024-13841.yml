summary: The Builder Shortcode Extras – WordPress Shortcodes Collection to Save You Time plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including,
  1.0.0 via the 'bse-elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which
  posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to extract data from private and draft posts created with Elementor that
  they should not have access to.
