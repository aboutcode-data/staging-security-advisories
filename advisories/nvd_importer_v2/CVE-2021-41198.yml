aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions if
  `tf.tile` is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow process will crash due
  to a `CHECK`-failure caused by an overflow. The number of elements in the output tensor is
  too much for the `int64_t` type and the overflow is detected via a `CHECK` statement. This
  aborts the process. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
