  drm: bridge: dw_hdmi: fix connector access for scdc

  Commit 5d844091f237 ("drm/scdc-helper: Pimp SCDC debugs") changed the scdc
  interface to pick up an i2c adapter from a connector instead. However, in
  the case of dw-hdmi, the wrong connector was being used to pass i2c adapter
  information, since dw-hdmi's embedded connector structure is only populated
  when the bridge attachment callback explicitly asks for it.

  drm-meson is handling connector creation, so this won't happen, leading to
  a NULL pointer dereference.

  Fix it by having scdc functions access dw-hdmi's current connector pointer
  instead, which is assigned during the bridge enablement stage.
