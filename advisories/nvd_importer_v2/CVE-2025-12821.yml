aliases: []
summary: The NewsBlogger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  versions 0.2.5.6  to 0.2.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the
  newsblogger_install_and_activate_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to upload arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link. This is due to a reverted fix of CVE-2025-1305.
