summary: The Coming Soon, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode By Dazzler plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to maintenance mode bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This
  is due to the plugin relying on the REQUEST_URI to determine if the page being accesses is
  an admin area.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass maintenance
  mode and access the site which may be considered confidential when in maintenance mode.
