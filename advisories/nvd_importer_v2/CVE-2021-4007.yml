aliases: []
summary: Rapid7 Insight Agent, versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34, suffer from a local privilege escalation
  due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent versions 3.0.1 to
  3.1.2.34 start, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at "C:\DLLs\python3.dll,"
  which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local
  user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue
  was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 3.1.2.35. This vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2019-5629.
