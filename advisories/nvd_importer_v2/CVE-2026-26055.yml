aliases: []
summary: Yoke is a Helm-inspired infrastructure-as-code (IaC) package deployer. In 0.19.0 and
  earlier, a vulnerability exists in the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) component of Yoke. The
  ATC webhook endpoints lack proper authentication mechanisms, allowing any pod within the cluster
  network to directly send AdmissionReview requests to the webhook, bypassing Kubernetes API
  Server authentication. This enables attackers to trigger WASM module execution in the ATC
  controller context without proper authorization.
