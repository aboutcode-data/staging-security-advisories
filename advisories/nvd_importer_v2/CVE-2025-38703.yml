  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe: Make dma-fences compliant with the safe access rules

  Xe can free some of the data pointed to by the dma-fences it exports. Most
  notably the timeline name can get freed if userspace closes the associated
  submit queue. At the same time the fence could have been exported to a
  third party (for example a sync_fence fd) which will then cause an use-
  after-free on subsequent access.

  To make this safe we need to make the driver compliant with the newly
  documented dma-fence rules. Driver has to ensure a RCU grace period
  between signalling a fence and freeing any data pointed to by said fence.

  For the timeline name we simply make the queue be freed via kfree_rcu and
  for the shared lock associated with multiple queues we add a RCU grace
  period before freeing the per GT structure holding the lock.
