  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  slab: Avoid race on slab->obj_exts in alloc_slab_obj_exts

  If two competing threads enter alloc_slab_obj_exts() and one of them
  fails to allocate the object extension vector, it might override the
  valid slab->obj_exts allocated by the other thread with
  OBJEXTS_ALLOC_FAIL. This will cause the thread that lost this race and
  expects a valid pointer to dereference a NULL pointer later on.

  Update slab->obj_exts atomically using cmpxchg() to avoid
  slab->obj_exts overrides by racing threads.

  Thanks for Vlastimil and Suren's help with debugging.
