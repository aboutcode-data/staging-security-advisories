aliases: []
summary: 'Interpretation conflict between Internet Explorer and other web browsers such as Mozilla,
  Opera, and Firefox might allow remote attackers to modify the visual presentation of web pages
  and possibly bypass protection mechanisms such as content filters via ASCII characters with
  the 8th bit set, which could be stripped by Internet Explorer to render legible text, but
  not when using other browsers. NOTE: there has been significant discussion about this issue,
  and as of 20060625, it is not clear where the responsibility for this issue lies, although
  it might be due to vagueness within the associated standards.  NOTE: this might only be exploitable
  with certain encodings.'
