summary: A sandbox escape issue was discovered in VyOS 1.1.8. It provides a restricted management
  shell for operator users to administer the device. By issuing various shell special characters

  and gain access to the underlying Linux shell. The user can then run arbitrary operating system
  commands with the privileges afforded by their account.
