  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()

  ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and
  .set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is
  buggy, so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver
  provides only _one_ of the callbacks results in a NULL pointer
  dereference instead of an -EOPNOTSUPP.

  Fix the condition so that the availability of both callbacks is
  ensured. This also matches the netlink code.

  Note that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the
  legacy ioctl path, and needs a specific combination of driver options:
  - have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no
   .set_coalesce(), or
  - have .set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn't
    cause the crash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce()
    and bails out on error.
