aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Vocera Report Server and Voice Server 5.x through 5.8. There
  is Path Traversal via the "restore SQL data" filename. The Vocera Report Console contains
  a websocket function that allows for the restoration of the database from a ZIP archive that
  expects a SQL import file. The filename provided is not properly sanitized and allows for
  the inclusion of a path-traversal payload that can be used to escape the intended Vocera restoration
  directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to point to a crafted ZIP archive
  that contains SQL commands that could be executed against the database.
