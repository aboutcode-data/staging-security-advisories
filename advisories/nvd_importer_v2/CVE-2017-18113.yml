aliases: []
summary: The DefaultOSWorkflowConfigurator class in Jira Server and Jira Data Center before
  version 8.18.1 allows remote attackers who can trick a system administrator to import their
  malicious workflow to execute arbitrary code via a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
  The vulnerability allowed for various problematic OSWorkflow classes to be used as part of
  workflows. The fix for this issue blocks usage of unsafe conditions, validators, functions
  and registers that are build-in into OSWorkflow library and other Jira dependencies. Atlassian-made
  functions or functions provided by 3rd party plugins are not affected by this fix.
