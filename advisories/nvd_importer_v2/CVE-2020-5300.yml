aliases: []
summary: 'In Hydra (an OAuth2 Server and OpenID Certified™ OpenID Connect Provider written in
  Go), before version 1.4.0+oryOS.17, when using client authentication method ''private_key_jwt''
  [1], OpenId specification says the following about assertion `jti`: "A unique identifier for
  the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST only be used
  once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties". Hydra does not check
  the uniqueness of this `jti` value. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat difficult because:
  - TLS protects against MITM which makes it difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay
  attacks - The expiry time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it could
  be replayed This has been patched in version v1.4.0+oryOS.17'
