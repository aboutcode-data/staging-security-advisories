aliases: []
summary: The File Uploader for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  uploads due to missing file type validation in the callback function for the 'add-image-data'
  REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the Uploadcare service and subsequently
  download them on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
