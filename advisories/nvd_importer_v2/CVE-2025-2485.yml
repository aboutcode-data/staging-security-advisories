aliases: []
summary: "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is\
  \ vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8.7 via deserialization\
  \ of untrusted input from the 'dnd_upload_cf7_upload'\r\n function. This makes it possible\
  \ for attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present\
  \ in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another\
  \ plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present\
  \ via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker\
  \ to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code\
  \ depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated\
  \ attackers when a form is present on the site with the file upload action. The Flamingo plugin\
  \ must be installed and activated in order to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability\
  \ was partially patched in version 1.3.8.8."
