  ax25: Fix reference count leak issues of ax25_dev

  The ax25_addr_ax25dev() and ax25_dev_device_down() exist a reference
  count leak issue of the object "ax25_dev".

  Memory leak issue in ax25_addr_ax25dev():

  The reference count of the object "ax25_dev" can be increased multiple
  times in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). This will cause a memory leak.

  Memory leak issues in ax25_dev_device_down():

  The reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 in ax25_dev_device_up() and
  then increase the reference count when ax25_dev is added to ax25_dev_list.
  As a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2. But when the device is
  shutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count once
  or twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause
  memory leak.

  As for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), it is impossible for one pointer
  to be on a list twice. So add a break in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for the
  issue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increase the reference count of ax25_dev
  once in ax25_dev_device_up() and decrease the reference count of ax25_dev
  after it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.
