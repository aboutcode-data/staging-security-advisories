aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: s390: pv: fix index value of replaced ASCE

  The index field of the struct page corresponding to a guest ASCE should
  be 0. When replacing the ASCE in s390_replace_asce(), the index of the
  new ASCE should also be set to 0.

  Having the wrong index might lead to the wrong addresses being passed
  around when notifying pte invalidations, and eventually to validity
  intercepts (VM crash) if the prefix gets unmapped and the notifier gets
  called with the wrong address.
