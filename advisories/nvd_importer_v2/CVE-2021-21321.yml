aliases: []
summary: fastify-reply-from is an npm package which is a fastify plugin to forward the current
  http request to another server. In fastify-reply-from before version 4.0.2, by crafting a
  specific URL, it is possible to escape the prefix of the proxied backend service. If the base
  url of the proxied server is "/pub/", a user expect that accessing "/priv" on the target service
  would not be possible. In affected versions, it is possible. This is fixed in version 4.0.2.
