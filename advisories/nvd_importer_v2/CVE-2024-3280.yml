summary: The Follow Us Badges plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's wpsite_follow_us_badges shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.10

  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
