aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Opsview Monitor Agent 6.8. An unauthenticated remote attacker
  can call check_nrpe against affected targets, specifying known NRPE plugins, which in default
  installations are configured to accept command control characters and pass them to command-line
  interpreters for NRPE plugin execution. This allows the attacker to escape NRPE plugin execution
  and execute commands remotely on the target as NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
