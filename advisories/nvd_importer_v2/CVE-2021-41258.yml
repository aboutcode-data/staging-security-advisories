aliases: []
summary: Kirby is an open source file structured CMS. In affected versions Kirby's blocks field
  stores structured data for each block. This data is then used in block snippets to convert
  the blocks to HTML for use in your templates. We recommend to escape HTML special characters
  to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The default snippet for the image block
  unfortunately did not use our escaping helper. This made it possible to include malicious
  HTML code in the source, alt and link fields of the image block, which would then be displayed
  on the site frontend and executed in the browsers of site visitors and logged in users who
  are browsing the site. Attackers must be in your group of authenticated Panel users in order
  to exploit this weakness. Users who do not make use of the blocks field are not affected.
  This issue has been patched in Kirby version 3.5.8 by escaping special HTML characters in
  the output from the default image block snippet. Please update to this or a later version
  to fix the vulnerability.
