aliases: []
summary: Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model
  flow. In version 3.0.5 and earlier, the `forgot-password` endpoint in Flowise returns sensitive
  information including a valid password reset `tempToken` without authentication or verification.
  This enables any attacker to generate a reset token for arbitrary users and directly reset
  their password, leading to a complete account takeover (ATO). This vulnerability applies to
  both the cloud service (`cloud.flowiseai.com`) and self-hosted/local Flowise deployments that
  expose the same API. Commit 9e178d68873eb876073846433a596590d3d9c863 in version 3.0.6 secures
  password reset endpoints. Several recommended remediation steps are available. Do not return
  reset tokens or sensitive account details in API responses. Tokens must only be delivered
  securely via the registered email channel. Ensure `forgot-password` responds with a generic
  success message regardless of input, to avoid user enumeration. Require strong validation
  of the `tempToken` (e.g., single-use, short expiry, tied to request origin, validated against
  email delivery). Apply the same fixes to both cloud and self-hosted/local deployments. Log
  and monitor password reset requests for suspicious activity. Consider multi-factor verification
  for sensitive accounts.
