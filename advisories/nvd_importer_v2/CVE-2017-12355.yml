aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Local Packet Transport Services (LPTS) ingress frame-processing
  functionality of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  cause one of the LPTS processes on an affected system to restart unexpectedly, resulting in
  a brief denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete LPTS frame
  validation by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  crafted XML requests to the management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause one of the LPTS processes on the affected system to restart
  unexpectedly, which would impact LPTS traffic and cause a brief DoS condition while the process
  restarts. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf76332.'
