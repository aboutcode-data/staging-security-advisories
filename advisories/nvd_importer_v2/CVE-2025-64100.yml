aliases: []
summary: CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data hubs and data
  portals. Prior to 2.10.9 and 2.11.4, session ids could be fixed by an attacker if the site
  is configured with server-side session storage (CKAN uses cookie-based session storage by
  default). The attacker would need to either set a cookie on the victim's browser or steal
  the victim's currently valid session. Session identifiers are now regenerated after each login.
  This vulnerability has been fixed in CKAN 2.10.9 and 2.11.4
