aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Keycloak. When an authenticated attacker attempts to merge accounts
  with another existing account during an identity provider (IdP) login, the attacker will subsequently
  be prompted to "review profile" information. This vulnerability allows the attacker to modify
  their email address to match that of a victim's account, triggering a verification email sent
  to the victim's email address. The attacker's email address is not present in the verification
  email content, making it a potential phishing opportunity. If the victim clicks the verification
  link, the attacker can gain access to the victim's account.
