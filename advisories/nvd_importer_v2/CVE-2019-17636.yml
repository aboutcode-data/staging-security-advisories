aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse Theia versions 0.3.9 through 0.15.0, one of the default pre-packaged Theia
  extensions is "Mini-Browser", published as "@theia/mini-browser" on npmjs.com. This extension,
  for its own needs, exposes a HTTP endpoint that allows to read the content of files on the
  host's filesystem, given their path, without restrictions on the requester's origin. This
  design is vulnerable to being exploited remotely through a DNS rebinding attack or a drive-by
  download of a carefully crafted exploit.
