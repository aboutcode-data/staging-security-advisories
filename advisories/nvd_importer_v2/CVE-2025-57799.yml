summary: StreamVault is a multi-platform video parsing and downloading tool. Prior to version
  250822, after logging into the StreamVault-system, an attacker can modify certain system parameters,
  construct malicious commands, execute command injection attacks against the system, and ultimately
  gain server privileges. Users of all versions of the StreamVault system to date who have not
  modified their background passwords or use weak passwords are at risk of having their systems
  taken over via remote command execution. This issue has been patched in version 250822.
