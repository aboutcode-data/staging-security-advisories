aliases: []
summary: "CrowdStrike uses industry-standard TLS (transport layer security) to secure communications\
  \ from the Falcon sensor to the CrowdStrike cloud. CrowdStrike has identified a validation\
  \ logic error in the Falcon sensor for Linux, Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller, and\
  \ Falcon Container Sensor where our TLS connection routine to the CrowdStrike cloud can incorrectly\
  \ process server certificate validation. This could allow an attacker with the ability to\
  \ control network traffic to potentially conduct a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. CrowdStrike\
  \ identified this issue internally and released a security fix in all Falcon sensor for Linux,\
  \ Falcon Kubernetes Admission Controller, and Falcon Container Sensor versions 7.06 and above.\n\
  \n \nCrowdStrike identified this issue through our longstanding, rigorous security review\
  \ process, which has been continually strengthened with deeper source code analysis and ongoing\
  \ program enhancements as part of our commitment to security resilience. CrowdStrike has no\
  \ indication of any exploitation of this issue in the wild. CrowdStrike has leveraged its\
  \ world class threat hunting and intelligence capabilities to actively monitor for signs of\
  \ abuse or usage of this flaw and will continue to do so. \n\n\nWindows and Mac sensors are\
  \ not affected by this."
