aliases: []
summary: 'Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with
  function-calling LLMs. In versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.3, there is a one-click Remote Code Execution
  vulnerability triggered through a custom url value, `transport` in the JSON object. An attacker
  can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious
  website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a
  victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated
  content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive''s custom URL handler (dive:), which launches
  the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim’s
  machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed
  in version 0.9.4.'
