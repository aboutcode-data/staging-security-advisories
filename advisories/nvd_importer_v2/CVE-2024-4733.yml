aliases: []
summary: The ShiftController Employee Shift Scheduling plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
  via deserialization of untrusted input via the `hc3_session`-cookie in versions up to, and
  including, 4.9.57. This makes it possible for an authenticated attacker with contributor access-level
  or above to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP
  chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could
  allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
