aliases: []
summary: The Memory Usage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 3.98. This is due to missing nonce validation in the wpmemory_install_plugin()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to silently install one of
  the several whitelisted plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
