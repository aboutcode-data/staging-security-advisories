summary: Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite. A reflected XSS vulnerability
  was found in Collabora Online prior to version 6.4.9-5. An attacker could inject unescaped
  HTML into a variable as they created the Collabora Online iframe, and execute scripts inside
  the context of the Collabora Online iframe. This would give access to a small set of user
  settings stored in the browser, as well as the session's authentication token which was also
  passed in at iframe creation time. The issue is patched in Collabora Online 6.4.9-5. Collabora
  Online 4.2 is not affected.
