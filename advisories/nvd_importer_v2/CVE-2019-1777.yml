summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of the Cisco Registered Envelope Service
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against another user of the service. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
  user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending an email with a malicious payload to another user. A
