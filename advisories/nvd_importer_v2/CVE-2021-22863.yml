summary: An improper access control vulnerability was identified in the GitHub Enterprise Server
  GraphQL API that allowed authenticated users of the instance to modify the maintainer collaboration
  permission of a pull request without proper authorization. By exploiting this vulnerability,
  an attacker would be able to gain access to head branches of pull requests opened on repositories
  of which they are a maintainer. Forking is disabled by default for organization owned private
  repositories and would prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, branch protections such as
  required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being
  merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub
  Enterprise Server since 2.12.22 and was fixed in versions 2.20.24, 2.21.15, 2.22.7 and 3.0.1.
  This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
