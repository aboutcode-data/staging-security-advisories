  up to, and including, 1.1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input from the wpeden_post_meta
  post meta value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable

  system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or
  execute code.
