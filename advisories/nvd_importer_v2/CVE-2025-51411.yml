aliases: []
summary: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Institute-of-Current-Students
  v1.0 via the email parameter in the /postquerypublic endpoint. The application fails to properly
  sanitize user input before reflecting it in the HTML response. This allows unauthenticated
  attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser
  by tricking them into visiting a crafted URL or submitting a malicious form. Successful exploitation
  may lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other client-side attacks.
