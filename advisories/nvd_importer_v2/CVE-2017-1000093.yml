summary: Poll SCM Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening
  itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to initiate polling of
  projects with a known name. While Jenkins in general does not consider polling to be a protection-worthy
  action as it's similar to cache invalidation, the plugin specifically adds a permission to
  be able to use this functionality, and this issue undermines that permission.
