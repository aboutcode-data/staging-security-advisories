aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud richdocuments is a Nextcloud app integrating the office suit Collabora Online.
  In affected versions the secure view feature of the rich documents app can be bypassed by
  using unprotected internal API endpoint of the rich documents app. It is recommended that
  the Nextcloud Office app (richdocuments) is upgraded to 8.0.0-beta.1, 7.0.2 or 6.3.2. Users
  unable to upgrade may mitigate the issue by taking steps to restrict the ability to download
  documents. This includes ensuring that the `WOPI configuration` is configured to only serve
  documents between Nextcloud and Collabora. It is highly recommended to define the list of
  Collabora server IPs as the allow list within the Office admin settings of Nextcloud.
