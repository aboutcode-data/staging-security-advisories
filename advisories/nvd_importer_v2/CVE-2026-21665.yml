aliases: []
summary: "The Print Service component of Fiserv Originate Loans Peripherals (formerly Velocity\
  \ Services) in unsupported version 2021.2.4 (build 4.7.3155.0011) uses deprecated .NET Remoting\
  \ TCP channels that allow unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. When these services are\
  \ exposed to an untrusted network in a client-managed deployment, an unauthenticated attacker\
  \ can achieve remote code execution. Version 2021.2.4 is no longer supported by Fiserv. Customers\
  \ should upgrade to a currently supported release (2025.1 or later) and ensure that .NET Remoting\
  \ service ports are not exposed beyond trusted network boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis CVE documents\
  \ behavior observed in a client-hosted deployment running an unsupported legacy version of\
  \ Originate Loans Peripherals with .NET Remoting ports exposed to an untrusted network. This\
  \ is not a default or supported configuration. Customers running legacy versions should upgrade\
  \ to a currently supported release and ensure .NET Remoting ports are restricted to trusted\
  \ network segments. The finding does not apply to Fiserv-hosted environments."
