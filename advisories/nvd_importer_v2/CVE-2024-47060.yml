aliases: []
summary: Zitadel is an open source identity management platform. In Zitadel, even after an organization
  is deactivated, associated projects, respectively their applications remain active. Users
  across other organizations can still log in and access through these applications, leading
  to unauthorized access. Additionally, if a project was deactivated access to applications
  was also still possible. The issue stems from the fact that when an organization is deactivated
  in Zitadel, the applications associated with it do not automatically deactivate. The application
  lifecycle is not tightly coupled with the organization's lifecycle, leading to a situation
  where the organization or project is marked as inactive, but its resources remain accessible.
  This vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to projects and their resources, which should
  have been restricted post-organization deactivation. Versions 2.62.1, 2.61.1, 2.60.2, 2.59.3,
  2.58.5, 2.57.5, 2.56.6, 2.55.8, and 2.54.10 have been released which address this issue. Users
  are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may explicitly disable the application to
  make sure the client is not allowed anymore.
