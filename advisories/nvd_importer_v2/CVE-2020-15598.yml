summary: 'Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial of service via a special request.
  NOTE: The discoverer reports "Trustwave has signaled they are disputing our claims." The CVE
  suggests that there is a security issue with how ModSecurity handles regular expressions that
  can result in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not consider this as a security
  issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here. An attacker would need to know
  that a rule using a potentially problematic regular expression was in place, 2) the attacker
  would need to know the basic nature of the regular expression itself to exploit any resource
  issues. It''s well known that regular expression usage can be taxing on system resources regardless
  of the use case. It is up to the administrator to decide on when it is appropriate to trade
  resources for potential security benefit'
