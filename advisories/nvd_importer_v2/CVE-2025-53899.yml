summary: Kiteworks MFT orchestrates end-to-end file transfer workflows. Prior to version 9.1.0,
  the back-end of Kiteworks MFT is vulnerable to an incorrectly specified destination in a communication
  channel which allows an attacker with administrative privileges on the system under certain
  circumstances to intercept upstream communication which could lead to an escalation of privileges.
