aliases: []
summary: 'The default configuration of Microsoft Windows 7 immediately prefers a new IPv6 and
  DHCPv6 service over a currently used IPv4 and DHCPv4 service upon receipt of an IPv6 Router
  Advertisement (RA), and does not provide an option to ignore an unexpected RA, which allows
  remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on communication with external IPv4
  servers via vectors involving RAs, a DHCPv6 server, and NAT-PT on the local network, aka a
  "SLAAC Attack." NOTE: it can be argued that preferring IPv6 complies with RFC 3484, and that
  attempting to determine the legitimacy of an RA is currently outside the scope of recommended
  behavior of host operating systems'
