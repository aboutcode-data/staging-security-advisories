  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Resolve TX timeout error in power save stress test

  This fixes the tx timeout issue seen while running a stress test on
  btnxpuart for couple of hours, such that the interval between two HCI
  commands coincide with the power save timeout value of 2 seconds.

  Test procedure using bash script:
  <load btnxpuart.ko>
  hciconfig hci0 up
  //Enable Power Save feature
  hcitool -i hci0 cmd 3f 23 02 00 00
  while (true)
  do
      hciconfig hci0 leadv
      sleep 2
      hciconfig hci0 noleadv
      sleep 2
  done

  Error log, after adding few more debug prints:
  Bluetooth: btnxpuart_queue_skb(): 01 0A 20 01 00
  Bluetooth: hci0: Set UART break: on, status=0
  Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() tx_work scheduled
  Bluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_work() dequeue: 01 0A 20 01 00
  Can't set advertise mode on hci0: Connection timed out (110)
  Bluetooth: hci0: command 0x200a tx timeout

  When the power save mechanism turns on UART break, and btnxpuart_tx_work()
  is scheduled simultaneously, psdata->ps_state is read as PS_STATE_AWAKE,
  which prevents the psdata->work from being scheduled, which is responsible
  to turn OFF UART break.

  This issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex around UART break on/off as
  well as around ps_state read/write.
  btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will now read updated ps_state value. If ps_state is
  PS_STATE_SLEEP, it will first schedule psdata->work, and then it will
  reschedule itself once UART break has been turned off and ps_state is
  PS_STATE_AWAKE.

  Tested above script for 50,000 iterations and TX timeout error was not
  observed anymore.
