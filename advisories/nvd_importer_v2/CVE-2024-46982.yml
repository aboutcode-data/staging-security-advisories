aliases: []
summary: 'Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. By sending
  a crafted HTTP request, it is possible to poison the cache of a non-dynamic server-side rendered
  route in the pages router (this does not affect the app router). When this crafted request
  is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a
  `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header which some upstream CDNs may cache
  as well. To be potentially affected all of the following must apply: 1. Next.js between 13.5.1
  and 14.2.9, 2. Using pages router, & 3. Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g.
  `pages/dashboard.tsx` not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`. This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js
  v13.5.7, v14.2.10, and later. We recommend upgrading regardless of whether you can reproduce
  the issue or not. There are no official or recommended workarounds for this issue, we recommend
  that users patch to a safe version.'
