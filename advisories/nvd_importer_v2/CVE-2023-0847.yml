aliases: []
summary: The Sub-IoT implementation of the DASH 7 Alliance protocol has a vulnerability that
  can lead to an out-of-bounds write prior to implementation version 0.5.0. If the protocol
  has been compiled using default settings, this will only grant the attacker access to allocated
  but unused memory. However, if it was configured using non-default settings, there is the
  possibility that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to system crashes and remote code
  execution.
