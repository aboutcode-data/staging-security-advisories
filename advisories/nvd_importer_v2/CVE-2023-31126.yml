aliases: []
summary: '`org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml` is an XML library used by the open-source wiki
  platform XWiki. The HTML sanitizer, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1, allows the injection
  of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid data attributes. This vulnerability
  does not affect restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner as there attributes are cleaned and thus
  characters like `/` and `>` are removed in all attribute names. This problem has been patched
  in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by making sure that data attributes only contain allowed characters.
  There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.'
