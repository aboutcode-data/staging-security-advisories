aliases: []
summary: eLabFTW is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. Prior to version
  4.3.0, a vulnerability allows an authenticated user with an administrator role in a team to
  assign itself system administrator privileges within the application, or create a new system
  administrator account. The issue has been corrected in eLabFTW version 4.3.0. In the context
  of eLabFTW, an administrator is a user account with certain privileges to manage users and
  content in their assigned team/teams. A system administrator account can manage all accounts,
  teams and edit system-wide settings within the application. The impact is not deemed as high,
  as it requires the attacker to have access to an administrator account. Regular user accounts
  cannot exploit this to gain admin rights. A workaround for one if the issues is removing the
  ability of administrators to create accounts.
