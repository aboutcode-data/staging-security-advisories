summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for Android (All versions
  < V3.15.10), SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for iOS (All versions < V3.15.10). Insufficient limitation
  of CONTROL script capabilities could allow read and write access from one HMI project cache
  folder to other HMI project cache folders within the app's sandbox on the same mobile device.
  This includes HMI project cache folders of other configured WinCC OA servers. The security
  vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who tricks an app user to connect to an attacker-controlled
  WinCC OA server. Successful exploitation requires user interaction and read/write access to
  the app's folder on a mobile device. The vulnerability could allow reading data from and writing
  data to the app's folder. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this
  security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides
  mitigations to resolve the security issue.
