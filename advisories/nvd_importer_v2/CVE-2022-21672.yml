aliases: []
summary: make-ca is a utility to deliver and manage a complete PKI configuration for workstations
  and servers. Starting with version 0.9 and prior to version 1.10, make-ca misinterprets Mozilla
  certdata.txt and treats explicitly untrusted certificates like trusted ones, causing those
  explicitly untrusted certificates trusted by the system. The explicitly untrusted certificates
  were used by some CAs already hacked. Hostile attackers may perform a MIM attack exploiting
  them. Everyone using the affected versions of make-ca should upgrade to make-ca-1.10, and
  run `make-ca -f -g` as the `root` user to regenerate the trusted store immediately. As a workaround,
  users may delete the untrusted certificates from /etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs manually
  (or by a script), but this is not recommended because the manual changes will be overwritten
  next time running make-ca to update the trusted anchor.
