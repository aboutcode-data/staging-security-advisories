aliases: []
summary: Valve's Game Networking Sockets prior to version v1.2.0 improperly handles unreliable
  segments with negative offsets in function SNP_ReceiveUnreliableSegment(), leading to a Heap-Based
  Buffer Underflow and a free() of memory not from the heap, resulting in a memory corruption
  and probably even a remote code execution.
