summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  block: zero non-PI portion of auto integrity buffer

  The auto-generated integrity buffer for writes needs to be fully
  initialized before being passed to the underlying block device,
  otherwise the uninitialized memory can be read back by userspace or
  anyone with physical access to the storage device. If protection
  information is generated, that portion of the integrity buffer is
  already initialized. The integrity data is also zeroed if PI generation
  is disabled via sysfs or the PI tuple size is 0. However, this misses
  the case where PI is generated and the PI tuple size is nonzero, but the
  metadata size is larger than the PI tuple. In this case, the remainder
  ("opaque") of the metadata is left uninitialized.
  Generalize the BLK_INTEGRITY_CSUM_NONE check to cover any case when the
  metadata is larger than just the PI tuple.
