aliases: []
summary: Conventional Changelog generates changelogs and release notes from a project's commit
  messages and metadata. Prior to version 2.0.0, @conventional-changelog/git-client has an argument
  injection vulnerability. This vulnerability manifests with the library's getTags() API, which
  allows extra parameters to be passed to the git log command. In another API by this library,
  getRawCommits(), there are secure practices taken to ensure that the extra parameter path
  is unable to inject an argument by ending the git log command with the special shell syntax
  --. However, the library does not follow the same practice for getTags() as it does not attempt
  to sanitize for user input, validate the given params, or restrict them to an allow list.
  Nor does it properly pass command-line flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX
  characters (--) to communicate the end of options. Thus, allowing users to exploit an argument
  injection vulnerability in Git due to the --output= command-line option that results with
  overwriting arbitrary files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.
