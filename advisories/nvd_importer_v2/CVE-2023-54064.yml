  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ipmi:ssif: Fix a memory leak when scanning for an adapter

  The adapter scan ssif_info_find() sets info->adapter_name if the adapter
  info came from SMBIOS, as it's not set in that case.  However, this
  function can be called more than once, and it will leak the adapter name
  if it had already been set.  So check for NULL before setting it.
