summary: grist-core is a spreadsheet hosting server. Prior to version 1.7.7, a user with only
  partial read access to a document could still access endpoints listing hashes for versions
  of that document and receive a full list of changes between versions, even if those changes
  contained cells, columns, or tables to which the user was not supposed to have read access.
  This was fixed in version 1.7.7 by restricting the `/compare` endpoint to users with full
  read access. As a workaround, remove sensitive document history using the `/states/remove`
  endpoint. Another possibility is to block the `/compare` endpoint.
