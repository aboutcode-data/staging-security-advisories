summary: Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. A security vulnerability was found
  in Kyverno where an attacker could cause denial of service of Kyverno. The vulnerability was
  in Kyvernos Notary verifier. An attacker would need control over the registry from which Kyverno
  would fetch signatures. With such a position, the attacker could return a malicious response
  to Kyverno, when Kyverno would send a request to the registry. The malicious response would
  cause denial of service of Kyverno, such that other users' admission requests would be blocked
  from being processed. This is a vulnerability in a new component released in v1.11.0. The
  only users affected by this are those that have been building Kyverno from source at the main
  branch which is not encouraged. Users consuming official Kyverno releases are not affected.
  There are no known cases of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.
