aliases: []
summary: The WP Bannerize Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via banner alt data in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
  installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
