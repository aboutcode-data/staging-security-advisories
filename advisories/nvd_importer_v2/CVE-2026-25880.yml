aliases: []
summary: SumatraPDF is a multi-format reader for Windows. In 3.5.2 and earlier, the PDF reader
  allows execution of a malicious binary (explorer.exe) located in the same directory as the
  opened PDF when the user clicks File → “Show in folder”. This behavior leads to arbitrary
  code execution on the victim’s system with the privileges of the current user, without any
  warning or user interaction beyond the menu click.
