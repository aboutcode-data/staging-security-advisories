summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon
  allows server administrators to suspend remote users to prevent interactions. However, some
  logic errors allow already-known posts from such suspended users to appear in timelines if
  boosted. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, previously-unknown posts from suspended
  users can be processed. This issue allows old posts from suspended users to occasionally end
  up on timelines on all Mastodon versions. Additionally, on Mastodon versions from v4.5.0 to
  v4.5.4, v4.4.5 to v4.4.11, v4.3.13 to v4.3.17, and v4.2.26 to v4.2.29, remote suspended users
  can partially bypass the suspension to get new posts in. Mastodon versions v4.5.5, v4.4.12,
  v4.3.18 are patched.
