  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

  For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
  same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
  primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
  regular files.

  However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
  is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
  which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
  leads to an UAF:

    erofs_fc_get_tree
      get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)
        erofs_read_superblock
          erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,
                             // return -ENOTBLK
        deactivate_locked_super
          free(sbi)
      if (err is -ENOTBLK)
        sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF

  So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the
  primary device must be a block device, and the extra device
  is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.
