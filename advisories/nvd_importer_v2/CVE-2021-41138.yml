aliases: []
summary: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In the newly introduced signed
  Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a large part of transaction validation
  logic was only called in transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious
  validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into a block. The attack
  is limited in that the signature is always validated, and the majority of the validation is
  done again in the subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain ID
  replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of main concerns, while they
  are limited by Substrate block size limits and other factors. The issue is patched in commit
  `146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba`.
