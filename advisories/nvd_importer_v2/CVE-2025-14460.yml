aliases: []
summary: The Piraeus Bank WooCommerce Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  unauthorized order status modification in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.4. This is
  due to missing authorization checks on the payment callback endpoint handler when processing
  the 'fail' callback from the payment gateway. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to change any order's status to 'failed' via the publicly accessible WooCommerce API endpoint
  by providing only the order ID (MerchantReference parameter), which can be easily enumerated
  as order IDs are sequential integers. This can cause significant business disruption including
  canceled shipments, inventory issues, and loss of revenue.
