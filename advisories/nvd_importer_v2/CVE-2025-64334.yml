summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In versions from 8.0.0 to before 8.0.2, compressed
  HTTP data can lead to unbounded memory growth during decompression. This issue has been patched
  in version 8.0.2. A workaround involves disabling LZMA decompression or limiting response-body-limit
