aliases: []
summary: bleon-ethical/api-gateway-deploy provides API gateway deployment. Version 1.0.0 is
  vulnerable to an attack chain involving OS Command Injection and Privilege Escalation. This
  allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges within the container,
  potentially leading to a container escape and unauthorized infrastructure modifications. This
  is fixed in version 1.0.1 by implementing strict input sanitization and secure delimiters
  in entrypoint.sh, enforcing a non-root user (appuser) in the Dockerfile, and establishing
  mandatory security quality gates.
