aliases: []
summary: The @fastify/express plugin adds full Express compatibility to Fastify. A security
  vulnerability exists in @fastify/express prior to version 4.0.3 where middleware registered
  with a specific path prefix can be bypassed using URL-encoded characters (e.g., `/%61dmin`
  instead of `/admin`). While the middleware engine fails to match the encoded path and skips
  execution, the underlying Fastify router correctly decodes the path and matches the route
  handler, allowing attackers to access protected endpoints without the middleware constraints.
  The vulnerability is caused by how @fastify/express matches requests against registered middleware
  paths. This vulnerability is similar to, but differs from, CVE-2026-22031 because this is
  a different npm module with its own code. Version 4.0.3 of @fastify/express contains a patch
  fort the issue.
