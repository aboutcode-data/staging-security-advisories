  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: imx-jpeg: Disable useless interrupt to avoid kernel panic

  There is a hardware bug that the interrupt STMBUF_HALF may be triggered
  after or when disable interrupt.
  It may led to unexpected kernel panic.
  And interrupt STMBUF_HALF and STMBUF_RTND have no other effect.
  So disable them and the unused interrupts.

  meanwhile clear the interrupt status when disable interrupt.
