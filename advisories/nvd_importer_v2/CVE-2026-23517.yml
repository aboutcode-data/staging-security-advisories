aliases: []
summary: Fleet is open source device management software. A broken access control issue in versions
  prior to 4.78.3, 4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2, and 4.53.3 allowed authenticated users to access
  debug and profiling endpoints regardless of role. As a result, low-privilege users could view
  internal server diagnostics and trigger resource-intensive profiling operations. Fleet’s debug/pprof
  endpoints are accessible to any authenticated user regardless of role, including the lowest-privilege
  “Observer” role. This allows low-privilege users to access sensitive server internals, including
  runtime profiling data and in-memory application state, and to trigger CPU-intensive profiling
  operations that could lead to denial of service. Versions 4.78.3, 4.77.1, 4.76.2, 4.75.2,
  and 4.53.3 fix the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, users should put the debug/pprof
  endpoints behind an IP allowlist as a workaround.
