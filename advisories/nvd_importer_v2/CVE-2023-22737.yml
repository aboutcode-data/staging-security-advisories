aliases: []
summary: wire-server provides back end services for Wire, a team communication and collaboration
  platform. Prior to version 2022-12-09, every member of a Conversation can remove a Bot from
  a Conversation due to a missing permissions check. Only Conversation admins should be able
  to remove Bots. Regular Conversations are not allowed to do so. The issue is fixed in wire-server
  2022-12-09 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-server
  need to be updated to 2022-12-09/Chart 4.29.0, so that their backends are no longer affected.
  There are no known workarounds.
