aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hfs: fix potential use after free in hfs_correct_next_unused_CNID()

  This code calls hfs_bnode_put(node) which drops the refcount and then
  dreferences "node" on the next line.  It's only safe to use "node"
  when we're holding a reference so flip these two lines around.
