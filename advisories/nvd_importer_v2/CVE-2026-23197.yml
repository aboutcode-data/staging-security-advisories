summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  i2c: imx: preserve error state in block data length handler

  When a block read returns an invalid length, zero or >I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX,
  the length handler sets the state to IMX_I2C_STATE_FAILED. However,
  i2c_imx_master_isr() unconditionally overwrites this with
  IMX_I2C_STATE_READ_CONTINUE, causing an endless read loop that overruns
  buffers and crashes the system.

  Guard the state transition to preserve error states set by the length
  handler.
