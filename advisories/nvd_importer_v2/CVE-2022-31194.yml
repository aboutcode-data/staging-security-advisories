aliases: []
summary: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access
  to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace. The JSPUI resumable upload
  implementations in SubmissionController and FileUploadRequest are vulnerable to multiple path
  traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to create files/directories anywhere on the server
  writable by the Tomcat/DSpace user, by modifying some request parameters during submission.
  This path traversal can only be executed by a user with special privileges (submitter rights).
  This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds. However, this vulnerability cannot be exploited by an anonymous user or a basic
  user. The user must first have submitter privileges to at least one Collection and be able
  to determine how to modify the request parameters to exploit the vulnerability.
