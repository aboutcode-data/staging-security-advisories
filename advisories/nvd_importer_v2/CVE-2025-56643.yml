aliases: []
summary: Requarks Wiki.js 2.5.307 does not properly revoke or invalidate active JWT tokens when
  a user logs out. As a result, previously issued tokens remain valid and can be reused to access
  the system, even after logout. This behavior affects session integrity and may allow unauthorized
  access if a token is compromised. The issue is present in the authentication resolver logic
  and affects both the GraphQL endpoint and the logout mechanism.
