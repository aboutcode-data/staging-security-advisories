summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps

  Code which interacts with timestamps needs to use the ktime_t type
  returned by functions like ktime_get. The int type does not offer
  enough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a
  recipe for problems. In this particular case, overflows would occur
  when calculating/storing timestamps leading to incorrect values being
  reported to userspace. In some cases these bad timestamps cause input
  handling in userspace to appear hung.
