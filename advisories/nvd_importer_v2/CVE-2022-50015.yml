summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-ipc: Do not process IPC reply before firmware boot

  It is not yet clear, but it is possible to create a firmware so broken
  that it will send a reply message before a FW_READY message (it is not
  yet clear if FW_READY will arrive later).
  Since the reply_data is allocated only after the FW_READY message, this
  will lead to a NULL pointer dereference if not filtered out.

  The issue was reported with IPC4 firmware but the same condition is present
  for IPC3.
