aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/mediatek: dp: Change logging to dev for mtk_dp_aux_transfer()

  Change logging from drm_{err,info}() to dev_{err,info}() in functions
  mtk_dp_aux_transfer() and mtk_dp_aux_do_transfer(): this will be
  essential to avoid getting NULL pointer kernel panics if any kind
  of error happens during AUX transfers happening before the bridge
  is attached.

  This may potentially start happening in a later commit implementing
  aux-bus support, as AUX transfers will be triggered from the panel
  driver (for EDID) before the mtk-dp bridge gets attached, and it's
  done in preparation for the same.
