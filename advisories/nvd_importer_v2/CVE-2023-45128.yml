aliases: []
summary: Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to inject
  arbitrary values and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This vulnerability can
  allow an attacker to inject arbitrary values without any authentication, or perform various
  malicious actions on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially compromising the security
  and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement
  of CSRF tokens within the application. This issue has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and
  users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas
  or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure,
  and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes as defense in depth measures. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
