summary: 'PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package.
  A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged
  attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to. A user
  is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing
  either `matplotlib` or `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least
  a user with higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user''s temporary directory is not
  locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing
  to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to very
  carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur
  exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`''s builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The
  application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory
  Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller
  >= 5.13.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
