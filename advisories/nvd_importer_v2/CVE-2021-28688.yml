aliases: []
summary: The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that subsequent cleanup
  code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values. This initialization went too far and may
  under certain conditions also overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack
  of cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully
  cleaning up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions
  having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect versions
  back to at least 3.11.
