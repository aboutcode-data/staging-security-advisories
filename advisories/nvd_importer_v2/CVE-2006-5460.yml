summary: 'Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Hinton Design phpht Topsites
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the phpht_real_path parameter
  to (1) index.php, (2) certain other scripts in the top-level directory, and (3) certain scripts
  in the admin/ directory.  NOTE: CVE disputes this vulnerability because $phpht_real_path is
  defined before use in index.php and most other files except common.php, which is already covered
  by CVE-2006-5458'
