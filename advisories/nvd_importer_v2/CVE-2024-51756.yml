aliases: []
summary: 'The cap-std project is organized around the eponymous `cap-std` crate, and develops
  libraries to make it easy to write capability-based code. cap-std''s filesystem sandbox implementation
  on Windows blocks access to special device filenames such as "COM1", "COM2", "LPT0", "LPT1",
  and so on, however it did not block access to the special device filenames which use superscript
  digits, such as "COM¹", "COM²", "LPT⁰", "LPT¹", and so on. Untrusted filesystem paths could
  bypass the sandbox and access devices through those special device filenames with superscript
  digits, and through them provide access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network
  resources mapped to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and
  any other device connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports.
  The bug is fixed in #371, which is published in cap-primitives 3.4.1, cap-std 3.4.1, and cap-async-std
  3.4.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue. Affected Windows users are recommended
  to upgrade.'
