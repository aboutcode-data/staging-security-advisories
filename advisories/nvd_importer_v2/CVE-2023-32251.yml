aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in the Linux kernel's ksmbd component (kernel SMB/CIFS
  server). A security control designed to prevent dictionary attacks, which introduces a 5-second
  delay during session setup, can be bypassed through the use of asynchronous requests. This
  bypass negates the intended anti-brute-force protection, potentially allowing attackers to
  conduct dictionary attacks more efficiently against user credentials or other authentication
  mechanisms.
