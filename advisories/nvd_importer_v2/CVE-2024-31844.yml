aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Italtel Embrace 1.6.4. The server does not properly handle
  application errors. In some cases, this leads to a disclosure of information about the server.
  An unauthenticated user is able craft specific requests in order to make the application generate
  an error. Inside an error message, some information about the server is revealed, such as
  the absolute path of the source code of the application. This kind of information can help
  an attacker to perform other attacks against the system. This can be exploited without authentication.
