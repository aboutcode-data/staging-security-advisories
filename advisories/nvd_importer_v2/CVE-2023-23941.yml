summary: SwagPayPal is a PayPal integration for shopware/platform. If JavaScript-based PayPal
  checkout methods are used (PayPal Plus, Smart Payment Buttons, SEPA, Pay Later, Venmo, Credit
  card), the amount and item list sent to PayPal may not be identical to the one in the created
  order. The problem has been fixed with version 5.4.4. As a workaround, disable the aforementioned
  payment methods or use the Security Plugin in version >= 1.0.21.
