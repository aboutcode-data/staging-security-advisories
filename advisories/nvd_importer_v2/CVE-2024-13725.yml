aliases: []
summary: The Keap Official Opt-in Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 via the service parameter. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to include PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of
  any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases where PHP files can be uploaded and included. If
  register_argc_argv is enabled on the server and pearcmd.php is installed, this issue might
  lead to Remote Code Execution.
