aliases: []
summary: OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions starting
  from 6.4.8 to before 6.4.10, the allow/deny lists can be bypassed, allowing a user to change
  attributes that are intended to be unmodifiable by the user. It is possible to toggle the
  `external` flag on/off and change the own token value for a user. It is also possible to edit
  attributes that are not in the allow list, such as `otp_qr` and `otp_activated`. If external
  users exist in the OpenCTI setup and the information about these users identities is sensitive,
  the above vulnerabilities can be used to enumerate existing user accounts as a standard low
  privileged user. This issue has been patched in version 6.4.10.
