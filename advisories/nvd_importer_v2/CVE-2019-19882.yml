aliases: []
summary: shadow 4.8, in certain circumstances affecting at least Gentoo, Arch Linux, and Void
  Linux, allows local users to obtain root access because setuid programs are misconfigured.
  Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly
  passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with
  setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd,
  groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local
  users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant
  in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins
  were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).
