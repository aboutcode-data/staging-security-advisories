summary: Arduino App Lab is a cross-platform IDE for developing Arduino Apps. Prior to 0.4.0,
  a vulnerability was identified in the Terminal component of the arduino-app-lab application.
  The issue stems from insufficient sanitization and validation of input data received from
  connected hardware devices, specifically in the _info.Serial and _info.Address metadata fields.
  The problem occurs during device information handling. When a board is connected, the application
  collects identifying attributes to establish a terminal session. Because strict validation
  is not enforced for the Serial and Address parameters, an attacker with control over the connected
  hardware can supply specially crafted strings containing shell metacharacters. The exploitation
  requires direct physical access to a previously tampered board. When the host system processes
  these fields, any injected payload is executed with the privileges of the user running arduino-app-lab.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.
