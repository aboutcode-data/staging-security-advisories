summary: 'NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  in lemoon 2.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
  unspecified search parameters, possibly the q parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this
  issue, saying "Sites are built on top of ASP.NET and you use lemoon core objects to easily
  manage and render content. The XSS vuln. you are referring to exists in one of our public
  sites built on lemoon i.e. a custom made site (as all sites are). The problem exists in a
  UserControl that handles form input and is in no way related to the lemoon core product.'
