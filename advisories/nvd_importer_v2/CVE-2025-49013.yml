summary: 'WilderForge is a Wildermyth coremodding API. A critical vulnerability has been identified
  in multiple projects across the WilderForge organization. The issue arises from unsafe usage
  of `${{ github.event.review.body }}` and other user controlled variables directly inside shell
  script contexts in GitHub Actions workflows. This introduces a code injection vulnerability:
  a malicious actor submitting a crafted pull request review containing shell metacharacters
  or commands could execute arbitrary shell code on the GitHub Actions runner. This can lead
  to arbitrary command execution with the permissions of the workflow, potentially compromising
  CI infrastructure, secrets, and build outputs. Developers who maintain or contribute to the
  repos WilderForge/WilderForge, WilderForge/ExampleMod, WilderForge/WilderWorkspace, WilderForge/WildermythGameProvider,
  WilderForge/AutoSplitter, WilderForge/SpASM, WilderForge/thrixlvault, WilderForge/MassHash,
  and/or WilderForge/DLC_Disabler; as well as users who fork any of the above repositories and
  reuse affected GitHub Actions workflows, are affected. End users of any the above software
  and users who only install pre-built releases or artifacts are not affected. This vulnerability
  does not impact runtime behavior of the software or compiled outputs unless those outputs
  were produced during exploitation of this vulnerability. A current workaround is to disable
  GitHub Actions in affected repositories, or remove the affected workflows.'
