aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the External RESTful Services (ERS) API of the Cisco Identity Services
  Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to generate arbitrary certificates
  signed by the Internal Certificate Authority (CA) Services on ISE. This vulnerability is due
  to an incorrect implementation of role-based access control (RBAC). An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by crafting a specific HTTP request with administrative credentials. A
  successful exploit could allow the attacker to generate a certificate that is signed and trusted
  by the ISE CA with arbitrary attributes. The attacker could use this certificate to access
  other networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.
