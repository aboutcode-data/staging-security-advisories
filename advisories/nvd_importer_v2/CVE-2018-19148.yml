aliases: []
summary: Caddy through 0.11.0 sends incorrect certificates for certain invalid requests, making
  it easier for attackers to enumerate hostnames. Specifically, when unable to match a Host
  header with a vhost in its configuration, it serves the X.509 certificate for a randomly selected
  vhost in its configuration. Repeated requests (with a nonexistent hostname in the Host header)
  permit full enumeration of all certificates on the server. This generally permits an attacker
  to easily and accurately discover the existence of and relationships among hostnames that
  weren't meant to be public, though this information could likely have been discovered via
  other methods with additional effort.
