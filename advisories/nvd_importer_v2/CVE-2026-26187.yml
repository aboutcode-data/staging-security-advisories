summary: lakeFS is an open-source tool that transforms object storage into a Git-like repositories.
  Prior to 1.77.0, the local block adapter (pkg/block/local/adapter.go) allows authenticated
  users to read and write files outside their designated storage boundaries. The verifyRelPath
  function used strings.HasPrefix() to verify that requested paths fall within the configured
  storage directory. This check was insufficient because it validated only the path prefix without
  requiring a path separator, allowing access to sibling directories with similar names. Also,
  the adapter verified that resolved paths stayed within the adapter's base path, but did not
  verify that object identifiers stayed within their designated storage namespace. This allowed
  attackers to use path traversal sequences in the object identifier to access files in other
  namespaces. Fixed in version v1.77.0.
