aliases: []
summary: Froxlor is open source server administration software. Prior to 2.1.9, a Stored Blind
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the Failed Login Attempts Logging
  Feature of the Froxlor Application. An unauthenticated User can inject malicious scripts in
  the loginname parameter on the Login attempt, which will then be executed when viewed by the
  Administrator in the System Logs.  By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform
  various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their
  knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new
  administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the
  application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.9.
