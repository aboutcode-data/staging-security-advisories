aliases: []
summary: RobotsAndPencils go-saml, a SAML client library written in Go, contains an authentication
  bypass vulnerability in all known versions. This is due to how the `xmlsec1` command line
  tool is called internally to verify the signature of SAML assertions. When `xmlsec1` is used
  without defining the enabled key data, the origin of the public key for the signature verification
  is, unfortunately, not restricted. That means an attacker can sign the SAML assertions themselves
  and provide the required public key (e.g. an RSA key) directly embedded in the SAML token.
  Projects still using RobotsAndPencils/go-saml should move to another SAML library or alternatively
  remove support for SAML from their projects. The vulnerability can likely temporarily be fixed
  by forking the go-saml project and adding the command line argument `--enabled-key-data` and
  specifying a value such as `x509` or `raw-x509-cert` when calling the `xmlsec1` binary in
  the verify function. Please note that this workaround must be carefully tested before it can
  be used.
