aliases: []
summary: b3log Wide before 1.6.0 allows three types of attacks to access arbitrary files. First,
  the attacker can write code in the editor, and compile and run it approximately three times
  to read an arbitrary file. Second, the attacker can create a symlink, and then place the symlink
  into a ZIP archive. An unzip operation leads to read access, and write access (depending on
  file permissions), to the symlink target. Third, the attacker can import a Git repository
  that contains a symlink, similarly leading to read and write access.
