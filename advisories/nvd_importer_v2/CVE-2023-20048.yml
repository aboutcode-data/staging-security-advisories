summary: A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center
  (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute certain unauthorized
  configuration commands on a Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) device that is managed by the FMC
  Software. This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of configuration commands
  that are sent through the web service interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by authenticating to the FMC web services interface and sending a crafted HTTP request to
