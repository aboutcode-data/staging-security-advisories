aliases: []
summary: 'Impact: The library offers a function to generate an ed25519 key pair via Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate
  with an optional param to provide a 32 byte seed value, which will then be used as the secret
  key. When no seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the secret
  key using secure randomness. However, a recent change broke this guarantee and uses an insecure
  seed for key pair generation. Since the private key of this identity (535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe)
  is compromised, one could lose funds associated with the principal on ledgers or lose access
  to a canister where this principal is the controller.'
