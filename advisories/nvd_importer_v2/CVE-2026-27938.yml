summary: WPGraphQL provides a GraphQL API for WordPress sites. Prior to version 2.9.1, the `wp-graphql/wp-graphql`
  repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow (`release.yml`) vulnerable to OS command injection
  through direct use of `${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}` inside a `run:` shell block.
  When a pull request from `develop` to `master` is merged, the PR body is injected verbatim
  into a shell command, allowing arbitrary command execution on the Actions runner. Version
  2.9.1 contains a fix for the vulnerability.
