aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in command/gpg. In some scenarios, hooks created by loaded modules
  are not removed when the related module is unloaded. This flaw allows an attacker to force
  grub2 to call the hooks once the module that registered it was unloaded, leading to a use-after-free
  vulnerability. If correctly exploited, this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code execution,
  eventually allowing the attacker to bypass secure boot protections.
