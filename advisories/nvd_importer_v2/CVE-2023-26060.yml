aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct before 22 FP2211. On the Working Set Manager
  page, users can create a Working Set with a name that has a client-side template injection
  payload. Input validation is missing during creation of the working set. For an external attacker,
  it is very difficult to exploit this, because a few dynamically created parameters such as
  Jsession-id, a CSRF token, and an Nxsrf token would be needed. The attack can realistically
  only be performed by an internal user.
