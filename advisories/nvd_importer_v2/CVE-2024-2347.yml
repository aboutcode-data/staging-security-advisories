summary: The Astra theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's
  display name in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level

  accesses an injected page.
