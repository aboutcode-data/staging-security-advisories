aliases: []
summary: Zero Trust Administrators have the ability to disallow end users from disabling WARP
  on their devices. Override codes can also be created by the Administrators to allow a device
  to temporarily be disconnected from WARP, however, due to lack of server side validation,
  an attacker with local access to the device, could extend the maximum allowed disconnected
  time of WARP client granted by an override code by changing the date & time on the local device
  where WARP is running.
