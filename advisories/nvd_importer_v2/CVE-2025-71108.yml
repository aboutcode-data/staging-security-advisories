summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: typec: ucsi: Handle incorrect num_connectors capability

  The UCSI spec states that the num_connectors field is 7 bits, and the
  8th bit is reserved and should be set to zero.
  Some buggy FW has been known to set this bit, and it can lead to a
  system not booting.
  Flag that the FW is not behaving correctly, and auto-fix the value
  so that the system boots correctly.

  Found on Lenovo P1 G8 during Linux enablement program. The FW will
  be fixed, but seemed worth addressing in case it hit platforms that
  aren't officially Linux supported.
