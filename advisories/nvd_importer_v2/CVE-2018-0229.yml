aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
  Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Desktop
  Platforms, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an authenticated
  AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software. The authentication
  would need to be done by an unsuspecting third party, aka Session Fixation. The vulnerability
  exists because there is no mechanism for the ASA or FTD Software to detect that the authentication
  request originates from the AnyConnect client directly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user to click a crafted link and authenticating using the company''s Identity
  Provider (IdP). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack a valid authentication
  token and use that to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through an affected device
  running ASA or FTD Software. This vulnerability affects the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility
  Client, and ASA Software and FTD Software configured for SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect
  Remote Access VPN that is running on the following Cisco products: 3000 Series Industrial
  Security Appliances (ISA), ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, ASA 5500-X Series
  Next-Generation Firewalls, ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and
  Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), Firepower 2100 Series
  Security Appliance, Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliance, Firepower 9300 ASA Security
  Module, FTD Virtual (FTDv). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg65072, CSCvh87448.'
