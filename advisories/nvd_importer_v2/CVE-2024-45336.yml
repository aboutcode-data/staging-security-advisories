aliases: []
summary: The HTTP client drops sensitive headers after following a cross-domain redirect. For
  example, a request to a.com/ containing an Authorization header which is redirected to b.com/
  will not send that header to b.com. In the event that the client received a subsequent same-domain
  redirect, however, the sensitive headers would be restored. For example, a chain of redirects
  from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectly send the Authorization header
  to b.com/2.
