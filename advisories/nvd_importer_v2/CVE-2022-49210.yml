  MIPS: pgalloc: fix memory leak caused by pgd_free()

  pgd page is freed by generic implementation pgd_free() since commit
  f9cb654cb550 ("asm-generic: pgalloc: provide generic pgd_free()"),
  however, there are scenarios that the system uses more than one page as
  the pgd table, in such cases the generic implementation pgd_free() won't
  be applicable anymore. For example, when PAGE_SIZE_4KB is enabled and
  MIPS_VA_BITS_48 is not enabled in a 64bit system, the macro "PGD_ORDER"
  will be set as "1", which will cause allocating two pages as the pgd
  table. Well, at the same time, the generic implementation pgd_free()
  just free one pgd page, which will result in the memory leak.

  The memory leak can be easily detected by executing shell command:
  "while true; do ls > /dev/null; grep MemFree /proc/meminfo; done"
