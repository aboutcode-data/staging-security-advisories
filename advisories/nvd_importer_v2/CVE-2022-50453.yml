  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpiolib: cdev: fix NULL-pointer dereferences

  There are several places where we can crash the kernel by requesting
  lines, unbinding the GPIO device, then calling any of the system calls
  relevant to the GPIO character device's annonymous file descriptors:
  ioctl(), read(), poll().

  While I observed it with the GPIO simulator, it will also happen for any
  of the GPIO devices that can be hot-unplugged - for instance any HID GPIO
  expander (e.g. CP2112).

  This affects both v1 and v2 uAPI.

  This fixes it partially by checking if gdev->chip is not NULL but it
  doesn't entirely remedy the situation as we still have a race condition
  in which another thread can remove the device after the check.
