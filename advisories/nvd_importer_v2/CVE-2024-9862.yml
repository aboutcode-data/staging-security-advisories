aliases: []
summary: The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Arbitrary User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This is due to the
  plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and
  access system resources, and the user current password check is missing. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator
  accounts.
