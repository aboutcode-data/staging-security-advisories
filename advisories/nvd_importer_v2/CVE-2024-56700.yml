  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: wl128x: Fix atomicity violation in fmc_send_cmd()

  Atomicity violation occurs when the fmc_send_cmd() function is executed
  simultaneously with the modification of the fmdev->resp_skb value.
  Consider a scenario where, after passing the validity check within the
  function, a non-null fmdev->resp_skb variable is assigned a null value.
  This results in an invalid fmdev->resp_skb variable passing the validity
  check. As seen in the later part of the function, skb = fmdev->resp_skb;
  when the invalid fmdev->resp_skb passes the check, a null pointer
  dereference error may occur at line 478, evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data;

  To address this issue, it is recommended to include the validity check of
  fmdev->resp_skb within the locked section of the function. This
  modification ensures that the value of fmdev->resp_skb does not change
  during the validation process, thereby maintaining its validity.

  This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
  developed by our team. This tool analyzes the locking APIs
  to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then
  analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible
  concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations.
