  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dpll: Prevent duplicate registrations

  Modify the internal registration helpers dpll_xa_ref_{dpll,pin}_add()
  to reject duplicate registration attempts.

  Previously, if a caller attempted to register the same pin multiple
  times (with the same ops, priv, and cookie) on the same device, the core
  silently increments the reference count and return success. This behavior
  is incorrect because if the caller makes these duplicate registrations
  then for the first one dpll_pin_registration is allocated and for others
  the associated dpll_pin_ref.refcount is incremented. During the first
  unregistration the associated dpll_pin_registration is freed and for
  others WARN is fired.

  Fix this by updating the logic to return `-EEXIST` if a matching
  registration is found to enforce a strict "register once" policy.
