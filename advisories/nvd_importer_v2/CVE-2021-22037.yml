aliases: []
summary: Under certain circumstances, when manipulating the Windows registry, InstallBuilder
  uses the reg.exe system command. The full path to the command is not enforced, which results
  in a search in the search path until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller
  vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker
  to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes precedence over the system command. The vulnerability
  only affects Windows installers.
