aliases: []
summary: The License Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  access of data due to a missing capability check on the showLicenseKey() and showAllLicenseKeys()
  functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with admin dashboard access (contributors by default due to WooCommerce) to view
  arbitrary decrypted license keys. The functions contain a referrer nonce check. However, these
  can be retrieved via the dashboard through the "license" JS variable.
