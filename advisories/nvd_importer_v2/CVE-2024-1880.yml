aliases: []
summary: An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the MacOS Text-To-Speech class MacOSTTS
  of the significant-gravitas/autogpt project, affecting versions up to v0.5.0. The vulnerability
  arises from the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the
  `_speech` method of the MacOSTTS class. Specifically, the use of `os.system` to execute the
  `say` command with user-supplied text allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can
  inject shell commands. This issue is triggered when the AutoGPT instance is run with the `--speak`
  option enabled and configured with `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PROVIDER=macos`, reflecting back a shell
  injection snippet. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential execution of arbitrary
  code on the instance running AutoGPT. The issue was addressed in version 5.1.0.
