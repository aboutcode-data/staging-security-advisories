aliases: []
summary: The Brevo - Email, SMS, Web Push, Chat, and more. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to authorization bypass due to type juggling in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0.
  This is due to the use of loose comparison (==) instead of strict comparison (===) when validating
  the installation ID in the `/wp-json/mailin/v1/mailin_disconnect` REST API endpoint. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disconnect the Brevo integration, delete
  the API key, remove all subscription forms, and reset plugin settings by sending a boolean
  `true` value for the `id` parameter, which bypasses the authorization check through PHP type
  juggling.
