  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: uas: fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer

  When a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is
  a probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is
  an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.
  Specifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function
  is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the
  sg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been
  freed.

  The SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()
  in uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.
  Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,
  data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
  occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result
  in URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully
  submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV
  error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
  scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()
  to invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully
  submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call
  usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg
  unmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.

  This patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()
  function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already
  been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking
  scsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully
  submitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then
  the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after
  all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()
  function will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after
  usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

  The error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls
  uas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,
  the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),
  where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete().
