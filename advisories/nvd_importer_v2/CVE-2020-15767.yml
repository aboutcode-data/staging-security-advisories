aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Gradle Enterprise before 2020.2.5. The cookie used to convey
  the CSRF prevention token is not annotated with the “secure” attribute, which allows an attacker
  with the ability to MITM plain HTTP requests to obtain it, if the user mistakenly uses a HTTP
  instead of HTTPS address to access the server. This cookie value could then be used to perform
  CSRF.
