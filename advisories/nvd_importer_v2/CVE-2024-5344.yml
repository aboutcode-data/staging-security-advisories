aliases: []
summary: The The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘forgoturl’ attribute within the plugin's WP Login
  & Register widget in all versions up to, and including, 5.5.6 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
