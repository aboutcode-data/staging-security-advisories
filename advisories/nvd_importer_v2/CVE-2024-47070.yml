aliases: []
summary: authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions
  prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header
  with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any
  account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance
  to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from
  external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password
  stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage
  is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which
  does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the
  policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the
  policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password
  stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue.
