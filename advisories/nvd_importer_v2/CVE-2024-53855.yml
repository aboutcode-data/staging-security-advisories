aliases: []
summary: 'Centurion ERP (Enterprise Rescource Planning) is a simple application developed to
  provide open source IT management with a large emphasis on the IT Service Management (ITSM)
  modules. A user who is authenticated and has view permissions for a ticket, can view the tickets
  of another organization they are not apart of. Users with following permissions are applicable:
  1. `view_ticket_change` permission can view change tickets from organizations they are not
  apart of. 2. `view_ticket_incident` permission can view incident tickets from organizations
  they are not apart of. 3. `view_ticket_request` permission can view request tickets from organizations
  they are not apart of. 4. `view_ticket_problem` permission can view problem tickets from organizations
  they are not apart of. The access to view the tickets from different organizations is only
  applicable when browsing the API endpoints for the tickets in question. The Centurion UI is
  not affected. Project Tasks, although a "ticket type" are also **Not** affected. This issue
  has been addressed in release version 1.3.1 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade may remove the ticket view permissions from users which would alleviate this vulnerability,
  if this is deemed not-viable, Upgrading is recommended.'
