aliases: []
summary: Data Center Operation allows for the upload of a zip file from its user interface to
  the server. A carefully crafted, malicious file could be mistakenly uploaded by an authenticated
  user via this feature which could contain path traversal file names. As such, it could allow
  for the arbitrary upload of files contained with the zip onto the server file system outside
  of the intended directory. This is leveraging the more commonly known ZipSlip vulnerability
  within Java code.
