aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the QEMU virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) implementation.
  This flaw is strictly related to CVE-2018-13405. A local guest user can create files in the
  directories shared by virtio-fs with unintended group ownership in a scenario where a directory
  is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of the group. This
  could allow a malicious unprivileged user inside the guest to gain access to resources accessible
  to the root group, potentially escalating their privileges within the guest. A malicious local
  user in the host might also leverage this unexpected executable file created by the guest
  to escalate their privileges on the host system.
