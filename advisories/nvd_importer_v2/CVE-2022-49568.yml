summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: Don't null dereference ops->destroy

  A KVM device cleanup happens in either of two callbacks:
  1) destroy() which is called when the VM is being destroyed;
  2) release() which is called when a device fd is closed.

  Most KVM devices use 1) but Book3s's interrupt controller KVM devices
  (XICS, XIVE, XIVE-native) use 2) as they need to close and reopen during
  the machine execution. The error handling in kvm_ioctl_create_device()
  assumes destroy() is always defined which leads to NULL dereference as
  discovered by Syzkaller.

  This adds a checks for destroy!=NULL and adds a missing release().

  This is not changing kvm_destroy_devices() as devices with defined
  release() should have been removed from the KVM devices list by then.
