aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
  software application. SuiteCRM relies on the blacklist of functions/methods to prevent installation
  of malicious MLPs. But this checks can be bypassed with some syntax constructions. SuiteCRM
  uses token_get_all to parse PHP scripts and check the resulted AST against blacklists. But
  it doesn't take into account all scenarios. This issue has been addressed in versions 7.14.6
  and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
