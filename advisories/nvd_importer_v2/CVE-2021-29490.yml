aliases: []
summary: Jellyfin is a free software media system that provides media from a dedicated server
  to end-user devices via multiple apps. Verions prior to 10.7.3 vulnerable to unauthenticated
  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks via the imageUrl parameter. This issue potentially
  exposes both internal and external HTTP servers or other resources available via HTTP `GET`
  that are visible from the Jellyfin server. The vulnerability is patched in version 10.7.3.
  As a workaround, disable external access to the API endpoints `/Items/*/RemoteImages/Download`,
  `/Items/RemoteSearch/Image` and `/Images/Remote` via reverse proxy, or limit to known-friendly
  IPs.
