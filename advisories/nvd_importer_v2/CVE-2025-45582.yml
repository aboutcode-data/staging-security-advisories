aliases: []
summary: 'GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR
  archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that
  contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive
  that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink
  name and ends with that critical file''s name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and
  overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of "Member name contains
  ''..''" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file
  via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain "x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh"
  and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications
  that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the
  blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which "tar
  xf" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies
  that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU
  Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each "tar xf" in its Security Rules of Thumb;
  however, third-party advice leads users to run "tar xf" more than once into the same directory.'
