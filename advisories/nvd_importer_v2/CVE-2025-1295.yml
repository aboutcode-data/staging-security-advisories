summary: The Templines Elementor Helper Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.7. This is due to allowing arbitrary user
  meta updates. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
  and above, to update their role to Administrator. The vulnerability can only be exploited
