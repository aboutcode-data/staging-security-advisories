aliases: []
summary: The s2Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 260127. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators,
  and leverage that to gain access to their account.
