aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the libxml2 library. This uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability
  occurs when processing XML catalogs that contain repeated <nextCatalog> elements pointing
  to the same downstream catalog. A remote attacker can exploit this by supplying crafted catalogs,
  causing the parser to redundantly traverse catalog chains. This leads to excessive CPU consumption
  and degrades application availability, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
