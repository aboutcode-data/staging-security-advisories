aliases: []
summary: The Responsive WordPress Slider WordPress plugin through 2.2.0 does not sanitise and
  escape some of the Slider options, allowing Cross-Site Scripting payloads to be set in them.
  Furthermore, as by default any authenticated user is allowed to create Sliders (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/slider-can-be-changed-from-any-user-even-subscriber/,
  such settings can be changed in the plugin's settings), this would allow user with a role
  as low as subscriber to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admins viewing
  the slider list and could lead to privilege escalation by creating a rogue admin account for
  example.
