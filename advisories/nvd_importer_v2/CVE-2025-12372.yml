aliases: []
summary: The Permalinks Cascade plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
  that a user is authorized to perform an action in the handleTPCAdminAjaxRequest function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
  to perform unauthorized administrative actions such as enabling or disabling automatic pinging
  settings and modifying page exclusion settings.
