aliases: []
summary: Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Prior to version 1.11.11,
  using the /locales/locale.json with the locale and namespace query parameters, a malicious
  actor is able to execute arbitrary code without being authenticated. With the ability to execute
  arbitrary code it could be used to gain access to the Panel's server, read credentials from
  the Panel's config, extract sensitive information from the database, access files of servers
  managed by the panel, etc. This issue has been patched in version 1.11.11. There are no software
  workarounds for this vulnerability, but use of an external Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  could help mitigate this attack.
