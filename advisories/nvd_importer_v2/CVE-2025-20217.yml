summary: "A vulnerability in the packet inspection functionality of the Snort 3 Detection Engine\
  \ of Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of traffic that is inspected by an affected\
  \ device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through\
  \ the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected\
  \ device to enter an infinite loop while inspecting traffic, resulting in a DoS condition.\
  \ The system watchdog will restart the Snort process automatically."
