summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iavf: use internal state to free traffic IRQs

  If the system tries to close the netdev while iavf_reset_task() is
  running, __LINK_STATE_START will be cleared and netif_running() will
  return false in iavf_reinit_interrupt_scheme(). This will result in
  iavf_free_traffic_irqs() not being called and a leak as follows:

      [7632.489326] remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/999', leaking at least 'iavf-enp24s0f0v0-TxRx-0'
      [7632.490214] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10 at fs/proc/generic.c:718 remove_proc_entry+0x19b/0x1b0

  is shown when pci_disable_msix() is later called. Fix by using the
  internal adapter state. The traffic IRQs will always exist if
  state == __IAVF_RUNNING.
