aliases: []
summary: The ViaAds plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the `ViaAds_pluginHandler`
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's API
  key and cookie consent settings via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
