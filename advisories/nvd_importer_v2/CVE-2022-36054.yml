aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation
  IoT devices. The 6LoWPAN implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system (file os/net/ipv6/sicslowpan.c)
  contains an input function that processes incoming packets and copies them into a packet buffer.
  Because of a missing length check in the input function, it is possible to write outside the
  packet buffer''s boundary. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who has the possibility
  to send 6LoWPAN packets to a Contiki-NG system. In particular, the vulnerability is exposed
  when sending either of two types of 6LoWPAN packets: an unfragmented packet or the first fragment
  of a fragmented packet. If the packet is sufficiently large, a subsequent memory copy will
  cause an out-of-bounds write with data supplied by the attacker.'
