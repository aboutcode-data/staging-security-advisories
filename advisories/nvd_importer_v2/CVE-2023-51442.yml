summary: Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. A security
  vulnerability has been identified in navidrome's subsonic endpoint, allowing for authentication
  bypass. This exploit enables unauthorized access to any known account by utilizing a JSON
  Web Token (JWT) signed with the key "not so secret". The vulnerability can only be exploited
  on instances that have never been restarted. Navidrome supports an extension to the subsonic
  authentication scheme, where a JWT can be provided using a `jwt` query parameter instead of
  the traditional password or token and salt (corresponding to resp. the `p` or `t` and `s`
  query parameters). This authentication bypass vulnerability potentially affects all instances
  that don't protect the subsonic endpoint `/rest/`, which is expected to be most instances
  in a standard deployment, and most instances in the reverse proxy setup too (as the documentation
  mentions to leave that endpoint unprotected). This issue has been patched in version 0.50.2.
