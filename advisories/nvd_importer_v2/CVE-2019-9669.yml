aliases: []
summary: 'The Wordfence plugin 7.2.3 for WordPress allows XSS via a unique attack vector. NOTE:
  It has been asserted that this is not a valid vulnerability in the context of the Wordfence
  WordPress plugin as the firewall rules are not maintained as part of the Wordfence software
  but rather it is a set of rules hosted on vendor servers and pushed to the plugin with no
  versioning associated. Bypassing a WAF rule doesn''t make a WordPress site vulnerable (speaking
  in terms of software vulnerabilities)'
