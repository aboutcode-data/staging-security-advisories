summary: The Simple Amazon Affiliate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'msg' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9 due to insufficient

  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
