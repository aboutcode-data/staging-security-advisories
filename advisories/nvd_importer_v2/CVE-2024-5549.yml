aliases: []
summary: A CORS misconfiguration in the stitionai/devika repository allows attackers to steal
  sensitive information such as logs, browser sessions, and settings containing private API
  keys from other services. This vulnerability also enables attackers to perform actions on
  behalf of the user, such as deleting projects or sending messages. The issue arises from the
  lack of proper origin validation, allowing unauthorized cross-origin requests to be executed.
  The vulnerability is present in all versions of the repository, as no fixed version has been
  specified.
