aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the FTP GVfs backend. A remote attacker could exploit this input
  validation vulnerability by supplying specially crafted file paths containing carriage return
  and line feed (CRLF) sequences. These unsanitized sequences allow the attacker to terminate
  intended FTP commands and inject arbitrary FTP commands, potentially leading to arbitrary
  code execution or other severe impacts.
