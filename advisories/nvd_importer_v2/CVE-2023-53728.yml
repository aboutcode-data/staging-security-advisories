summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nposix-timers:\
  \ Ensure timer ID search-loop limit is valid\n\nposix_timer_add() tries to allocate a posix\
  \ timer ID by starting from the\ncached ID which was stored by the last successful allocation.\n\
  \nThis is done in a loop searching the ID space for a free slot one by\none. The loop has\
  \ to terminate when the search wrapped around to the\nstarting point.\n\nBut that's racy vs.\
  \ establishing the starting point. That is read out\nlockless, which leads to the following\
  \ problem:\n\nCPU0\t  \t      \t     \t   CPU1\nposix_timer_add()\n  start = sig->posix_timer_id;\n\
  \  lock(hash_lock);\n  ...\t\t\t\t   posix_timer_add()\n  if (++sig->posix_timer_id < 0)\n\
  \      \t\t\t             start = sig->posix_timer_id;\n     sig->posix_timer_id = 0;\n\n\
  So CPU1 can observe a negative start value, i.e. -1, and the loop break\nnever happens because\
  \ the condition can never be true:\n\n  if (sig->posix_timer_id == start)\n     break;\n\n\
  While this is unlikely to ever turn into an endless loop as the ID space is\nhuge (INT_MAX),\
  \ the racy read of the start value caught the attention of\nKCSAN and Dmitry unearthed that\
  \ incorrectness.\n\nRewrite it so that all id operations are under the hash lock."
