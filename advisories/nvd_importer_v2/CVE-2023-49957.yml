summary: 'An issue was discovered in Dalmann OCPP.Core before 1.3.0 for OCPP (Open Charge Point
  Protocol) for electric vehicles. It permits multiple transactions with the same connectorId
  and idTag, contrary to the expected ConcurrentTx status. This could result in critical transaction
  management and billing errors. NOTE: the vendor''s perspective is "Imagine you''ve got two
  cars in your family and want to charge both in parallel on the same account/token? Why should
  that be rejected?"'
