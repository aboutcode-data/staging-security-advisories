  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bus: mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointer

  Though we do check the event ring read pointer by "is_valid_ring_ptr"
  to make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the
  pointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elements
  are 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer
  could lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption.

  So add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.
