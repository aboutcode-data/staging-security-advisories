aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.3-milestone-2 and
  prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6RC1, the Solr-based search suggestion provider
  that also duplicates as generic JavaScript API for search results in XWiki exposes the content
  of all documents of all wikis to anybody who has access to it, by default it is public. This
  exposes all information stored in the wiki (but not some protected information like password
  hashes). While there is a right check normally, the right check can be circumvented by explicitly
  requesting fields from Solr that don't include the data for the right check. This has been
  fixed in XWiki 15.6RC1, 15.5.1 and 14.10.15 by not listing documents whose rights cannot be
  checked. No known workarounds are available.
