aliases: []
summary: Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level advertisement
  and internet tracker blocking application. Pi-hole Admin Interface before 6.3 is vulnerable
  to Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) injection. When a request is made to a file ending with
  the .lp extension, the application performs a redirect without properly sanitizing the input.
  An attacker can inject carriage return and line feed characters (%0d%0a) to manipulate both
  the headers and the content of the HTTP response. This enables the injection of arbitrary
  HTTP response headers, potentially leading to session fixation, cache poisoning, and the weakening
  or bypassing of browser-based security mechanisms such as Content Security Policy or X-XSS-Protection.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 6.3.
