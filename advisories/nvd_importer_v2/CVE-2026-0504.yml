summary: Due to insufficient input handling, the SAP Identity Management REST interface allows
  an authenticated administrator to submit specially crafted malicious REST requests that are
  processed by JNDI operations without adequate input neutralization. This may lead to limited
  disclosure or modification of data, resulting in low impact on confidentiality and integrity,
  with no impact on application availability.
