aliases: []
summary: The Tightrope Media Carousel digital signage product 7.0.4.104 contains an arbitrary
  file upload vulnerability in the Manage Bulletins/Upload feature, which can be leveraged to
  gain remote code execution. An authenticated attacker can upload a crafted ZIP file (based
  on an exported backup of existing "Bulletins") containing a malicious file. When uploaded,
  the system only checks for the presence of the needed files within the ZIP and, as long as
  the malicious file is named properly, will extract all contained files to a new directory
  on the system, named with a random GUID. The attacker can determine this GUID by previewing
  an image from the uploaded Bulletin within the web UI. Once the GUID is determined, the attacker
  can navigate to the malicious file and execute it. In testing, an ASPX web shell was uploaded,
  allowing for remote-code execution in the context of a restricted IIS user.
