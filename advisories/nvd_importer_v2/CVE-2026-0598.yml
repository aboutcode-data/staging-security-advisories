aliases: []
summary: A security flaw was identified in the Ansible Lightspeed API conversation endpoints
  that handle AI chat interactions. The APIs do not properly verify whether a conversation identifier
  belongs to the authenticated user making the request. As a result, an attacker with valid
  credentials could access or influence conversations owned by other users. This exposes sensitive
  conversation data and allows unauthorized manipulation of AI-generated outputs.
