  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bcache: fix variable length array abuse in btree_iter

  btree_iter is used in two ways: either allocated on the stack with a
  fixed size MAX_BSETS, or from a mempool with a dynamic size based on the
  specific cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of
  size MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized
  iterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.

  This patch uses the same approach as in bcachefs's sort_iter and splits
  the iterator into a btree_iter with a flexible array member and a
  btree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a fixed-length
  data array.
