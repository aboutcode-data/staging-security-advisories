aliases: []
summary: The Product Input Fields for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the add_product_input_fields_to_order_item_meta()
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.0. This may make it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible. Please note that by default the plugin is only vulnerable to a double
  extension file upload attack, unless an administrators leaves the accepted file extensions
  field blank which can make .php file uploads possible. Please note 1.12.2 was mistakenly marked
  as patched while 1.12.1 was marked as vulnerable for a short period of time, this is not the
  case and 1.12.1 is fully patched.
