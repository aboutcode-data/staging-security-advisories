aliases: []
summary: Versions of the Traccar open-source GPS tracking system up to and including 6.11.1
  contain an issue in which authenticated users can steal OAuth 2.0 authorization codes by exploiting
  an open redirect vulnerability in two OIDC-related endpoints. The `redirect_uri` parameter
  is not validated against a whitelist, allowing attackers to redirect authorization codes to
  attacker-controlled URLs, enabling account takeover on any OAuth-integrated application. As
  of time of publication, it is unclear whether a fix is available.
