summary: The WS Form LITE – Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of remove_query_arg without
  appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.244. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
  if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
