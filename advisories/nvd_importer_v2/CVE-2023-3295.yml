summary: The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation of files in the
  file manager functionality in versions up to, and including, 1.5.66 . This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The issue
  was partially patched in version 1.5.66 and fully patched in 1.5.67. CVE-2023-31231 appears
  to be a duplicate of this issue.
