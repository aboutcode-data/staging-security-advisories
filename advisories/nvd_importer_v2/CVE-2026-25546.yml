aliases: []
summary: Godot MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Godot game
  engine. Prior to version 0.1.1, a command injection vulnerability in godot-mcp allows remote
  code execution. The executeOperation function passed user-controlled input (e.g., projectPath)
  directly to exec(), which spawns a shell. An attacker could inject shell metacharacters like
  $(command) or &calc to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the MCP server process.
  This affects any tool that accepts projectPath, including create_scene, add_node, load_sprite,
  and others. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.1.
