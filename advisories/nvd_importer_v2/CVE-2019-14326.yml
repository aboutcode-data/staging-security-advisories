aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in AndyOS Andy versions up to 46.11.113. By default, it starts
  telnet and ssh (ports 22 and 23) with root privileges in the emulated Android system. This
  can be exploited by remote attackers to gain full access to the device, or by malicious apps
  installed inside the emulator to perform privilege escalation from a normal user to root (unlike
  with standard methods of getting root privileges on Android - e.g., the SuperSu program -
  the user is not asked for consent). There is no authentication performed - access to a root
  shell is given upon a successful connection. NOTE: although this was originally published
  with a slightly different CVE ID number, the correct ID for this Andy vulnerability has always
  been CVE-2019-14326.'
