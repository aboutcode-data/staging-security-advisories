aliases: []
summary: diag_routes.php in pfSense 2.5.2 allows sed data injection. Authenticated users are
  intended to be able to view data about the routes set in the firewall. The data is retrieved
  by executing the netstat utility, and then its output is parsed via the sed utility. Although
  the common protection mechanisms against command injection (i.e., the usage of the escapeshellarg
  function for the arguments) are used, it is still possible to inject sed-specific code and
  write an arbitrary file in an arbitrary location.
