  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint

  Patch series "nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints".

  This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when using
  nilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.


  This patch (of 2):

  It has been reported that when using "block:block_touch_buffer"
  tracepoint, touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes a
  NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when KASAN is
  enabled.

  This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer(), it
  references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether the
  buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current
  implementation, the block_device structure is set after the function
  returns to the caller.

  Here, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer
  head as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the
  caller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it
  was reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call
  touch_buffer() here in the first place.

  So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.
