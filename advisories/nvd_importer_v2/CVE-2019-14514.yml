aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Microvirt MEmu all versions prior to 7.0.2. A guest Android
  operating system inside the MEmu emulator contains a /system/bin/systemd binary that is run
  with root privileges on startup (this is unrelated to Red Hat's systemd init program, and
  is a closed-source proprietary tool that seems to be developed by Microvirt). This program
  opens TCP port 21509, presumably to receive installation-related commands from the host OS.
  Because everything after the installer:uninstall command is concatenated directly into a system()
  call, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands by supplying shell metacharacters.
