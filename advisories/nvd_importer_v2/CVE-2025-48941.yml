aliases: []
summary: MyBB is free and open source forum software. Prior to version 1.8.39, the search component
  does not validate permissions correctly, which allows attackers to determine the existence
  of hidden (draft, unapproved, or soft-deleted) threads containing specified text in the title.
  The visibility state (`mybb_threads.visible` integer column) of threads is not validated in
  internal search queries, whose result is used to output a general success or failure of the
  search. While MyBB validates permissions when displaying the final search results, a search
  operation that internally produces at least one result outputs a redirect response (as a HTTP
  redirect, or a success message page with delayed redirect, depending on configuration). On
  the other hand, a search operation that internally produces no results outputs a corresponding
  message in the response without a redirect. This allows a user to determine whether threads
  matching title search parameters exist, including draft threads (`visible` with a value of
  `-2`), soft-deleted threads (`visible` with a value of `-1`), and unapproved threads (`visible`
  with a value of `0`); in addition to displaying generally visible threads (`visible` with
  a value of `1`). This vulnerability does not affect other layers of permissions. In order
  to exploit the vulnerability, the user must have access to the search functionality, and general
  access to forums containing the thread(s). The vulnerability does not expose the message content
  of posts. MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue.
