aliases: []
summary: In versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.0, the bucket named "default" was a special
  bucket that allowed read and write access without authentication. As part of 5.0, the behavior
  of all buckets including "default" were changed to only allow access by authenticated users
  with sufficient authorization. However, users were allowed unauthenticated and unauthorized
  access to the "default" bucket if the properties of this bucket were edited. This has been
  fixed in versions 5.1.0 and 5.5.0.
