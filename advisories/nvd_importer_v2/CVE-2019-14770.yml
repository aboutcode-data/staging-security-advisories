aliases: []
summary: In Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3, some menu links within
  the administration bar may be crafted to execute JavaScript when the administrator is logged
  in and uses the search functionality. (This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permissions
  to create administrative menu links, such as by creating a content type or layout. Such permissions
  are usually restricted to trusted or administrative users.)
