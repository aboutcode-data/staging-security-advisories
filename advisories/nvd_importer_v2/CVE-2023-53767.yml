summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_qmi_driver_event_work()

  Currently the buffer pointed by event is not freed in case
  ATH12K_FLAG_UNREGISTERING bit is set, this causes memory leak.

  Add a goto skip instead of return, to ensure event and all the
  list entries are freed properly.

  Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
