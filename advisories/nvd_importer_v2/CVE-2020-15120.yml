aliases: []
summary: In "I hate money" before version 4.1.5, an authenticated member of one project can
  modify and delete members of another project, without knowledge of this other project's private
  code. This can be further exploited to access all bills of another project without knowledge
  of this other project's private code. With the default configuration, anybody is allowed to
  create a new project. An attacker can create a new project and then use it to become authenticated
  and exploit this flaw. As such, the exposure is similar to an unauthenticated attack, because
  it is trivial to become authenticated. This is fixed in version 4.1.5.
