summary: screenshot-desktop allows capturing a screenshot of your local machine. This vulnerability
  is a command injection issue. When user-controlled input is passed into the format option
  of the screenshot function, it is interpolated into a shell command without sanitization.
  This results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the calling process. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 1.15.2.
