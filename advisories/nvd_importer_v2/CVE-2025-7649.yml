summary: The Surbma | Recent Comments Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'recent-comments' shortcode in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
  attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
