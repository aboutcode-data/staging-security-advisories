aliases: []
summary: Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR Secure Connections pairing and Secure Simple Pairing using
  the Passkey entry protocol in Bluetooth Core Specifications 2.1 through 5.3 may permit an
  unauthenticated man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing by
  reflection of a crafted public key with the same X coordinate as the offered public key and
  by reflection of the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting
  this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct
  Passkey for the pairing session. This is a related issue to CVE-2020-26558.
