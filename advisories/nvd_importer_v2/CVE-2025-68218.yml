  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvme-multipath: fix lockdep WARN due to partition scan work

  Blktests test cases nvme/014, 057 and 058 fail occasionally due to a
  lockdep WARN. As reported in the Closes tag URL, the WARN indicates that
  a deadlock can happen due to the dependency among disk->open_mutex,
  kblockd workqueue completion and partition_scan_work completion.

  To avoid the lockdep WARN and the potential deadlock, cut the dependency
  by running the partition_scan_work not by kblockd workqueue but by
  nvme_wq.
