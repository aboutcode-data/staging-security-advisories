aliases: []
summary: The Opt-In Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the admin_upload() function in all versions up to, and
  including, 4.07. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible. Due to the presence of an .htaccess file, this can only be exploited
  to achieve RCE on NGINX servers, unless another vulnerability is present.
