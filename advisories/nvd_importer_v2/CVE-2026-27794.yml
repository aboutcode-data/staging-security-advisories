summary: LangGraph Checkpoint defines the base interface for LangGraph checkpointers. Prior
  to version 4.0.0, a Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in LangGraph's caching layer
  when applications enable cache backends that inherit from `BaseCache` and opt nodes into caching
  via `CachePolicy`. Prior to `langgraph-checkpoint` 4.0.0, `BaseCache` defaults to `JsonPlusSerializer(pickle_fallback=True)`.
  When msgpack serialization fails, cached values can be deserialized via `pickle.loads(...)`.
  Caching is not enabled by default. Applications are affected only when the application explicitly
  enables a cache backend (for example by passing `cache=...` to `StateGraph.compile(...)` or
  otherwise configuring a `BaseCache` implementation), one or more nodes opt into caching via
  `CachePolicy`, and the attacker can write to the cache backend (for example a network-accessible
  Redis instance with weak/no auth, shared cache infrastructure reachable by other tenants/services,
  or a writable SQLite cache file). An attacker must be able to write attacker-controlled bytes
  into the cache backend such that the LangGraph process later reads and deserializes them.
  This typically requires write access to a networked cache (for example a network-accessible
  Redis instance with weak/no auth or shared cache infrastructure reachable by other tenants/services)
  or write access to local cache storage (for example a writable SQLite cache file via permissive
  file permissions or a shared writable volume). Because exploitation requires write access
  to the cache storage layer, this is a post-compromise / post-access escalation vector. LangGraph
  Checkpoint 4.0.0 patches the issue.
