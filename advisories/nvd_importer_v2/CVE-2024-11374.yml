summary: The TWChat – Send or receive messages from users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of remove_query_arg without appropriate escaping

  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
