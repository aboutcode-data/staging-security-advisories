aliases: []
summary: A search path or unquoted item vulnerability in Faronics Deep Freeze Server Standard,
  which affects versions 8.30.020.4627 and earlier. This vulnerability affects the DFServ.exe
  file. An attacker with local user privileges could exploit this vulnerability to replace the
  legitimate DFServ.exe service executable with a malicious file of the same name and located
  in a directory that has a higher priority than the legitimate directory. Thus, when the service
  starts, it will run the malicious file instead of the legitimate executable, allowing the
  attacker to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access to the compromised system or
  stop the service from running.
