aliases: []
summary: gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin, which separates
  the front and rear of the full stack. gin-vue-admin pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240407133540-7bc7c3051067,
  corresponding to version 2.6.1, has a code injection vulnerability in the backend. In the
  Plugin System -> Plugin Template feature, an attacker can perform directory traversal by manipulating
  the `plugName` parameter. They can create specific folders such as `api`, `config`, `global`,
  `model`, `router`, `service`, and `main.go` function within the specified traversal directory.
  Moreover, the Go files within these folders can have arbitrary code inserted based on a specific
  PoC parameter. The main reason for the existence of this vulnerability is the controllability
  of the PlugName field within the struct. Pseudoversion 0.0.0-20240409100909-b1b7427c6ea6,
  corresponding to commit b1b7427c6ea6c7a027fa188c6be557f3795e732b, contains a patch for the
  issue. As a workaround, one may manually use a filtering method available in the GitHub Security
  Advisory to rectify the directory traversal problem.
