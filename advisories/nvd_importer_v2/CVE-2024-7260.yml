aliases: []
summary: "An open redirect vulnerability was found in Keycloak. A specially crafted URL can\
  \ be constructed where the referrer and referrer_uri parameters are made to trick a user to\
  \ visit a malicious webpage. A trusted URL can trick users and automation into believing that\
  \ the URL is safe, when, in fact, it redirects to a malicious server. This issue can result\
  \ in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect, potentially leading\
  \ to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.\r\n\r\nOnce a crafted URL is\
  \ made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability\
  \ when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target\
  \ users they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass\
  \ other domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. The\
  \ malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding, to hide the text\
  \ of the actual malicious website domain."
