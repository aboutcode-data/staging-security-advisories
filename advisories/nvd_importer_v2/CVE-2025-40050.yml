  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Skip scalar adjustment for BPF_NEG if dst is a pointer

  In check_alu_op(), the verifier currently calls check_reg_arg() and
  adjust_scalar_min_max_vals() unconditionally for BPF_NEG operations.
  However, if the destination register holds a pointer, these scalar
  adjustments are unnecessary and potentially incorrect.

  This patch adds a check to skip the adjustment logic when the destination
  register contains a pointer.
