aliases: []
summary: The check_privacy_settings AJAX action of the WordPress GDPR WordPress plugin before
  1.9.26, available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, responds with JSON data
  without an "application/json" content-type. Since an HTML payload isn't properly escaped,
  it may be interpreted by a web browser led to this endpoint. Javascript code may be executed
  on a victim's browser. If the victim is an administrator with a valid session cookie, full
  control of the WordPress instance may be taken (AJAX calls and iframe manipulation are possible
  because the vulnerable endpoint is on the same domain as the admin panel - there is no same-origin
  restriction).
