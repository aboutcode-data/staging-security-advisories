aliases: []
summary: 'The Foreign Function Interface (ffi) extension in PHP 5.0.5 does not follow safe_mode
  restrictions, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code by loading
  an arbitrary DLL and calling a function, as demonstrated by kernel32.dll and the WinExec function.  NOTE:
  this issue does not cross privilege boundaries in most contexts, so perhaps it should not
  be included in CVE.'
