summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Check the helper function is valid in get_helper_proto

  kernel test robot reported verifier bug [1] where the helper func
  pointer could be NULL due to disabled config option.

  As Alexei suggested we could check on that in get_helper_proto
  directly. Marking tail_call helper func with BPF_PTR_POISON,
  because it is unused by design.
