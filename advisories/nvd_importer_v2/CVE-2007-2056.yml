summary: 'Rejected reason: The getlock function in aimage/aimage.cpp in AFFLIB 2.2.8 and earlier
  allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on temporary lock files
  (aka "time-of-check-time-of-use file race"). NOTE: the researcher has retracted the original
  advisory, stating that "the portion of vulnerable code is not called in any current version
  of AFFLIB and is therefore not exploitable.'
