summary: DiscoTOC is a Discourse theme component that generates a table of contents for topics.
  Users that can create topics in TOC-enabled categories (and have sufficient trust level -
  configured in component's settings) are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that topic's page.
  The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch. Admins can update the theme component through
  the admin UI (Customize -> Themes -> Components -> DiscoTOC -> Check for Updates). Alternatively,
  admins can temporarily disable the DiscoTOC theme component.
