aliases: []
summary: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant
  applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification
  of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related
  packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does
  not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible
  attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all
  other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a
  light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet
  to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.
