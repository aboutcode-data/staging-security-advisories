aliases: []
summary: strongSwan versions 5.9.2 through 5.9.5 are affected by authorization bypass through
  improper validation of certificate with host mismatch (CWE-297). When certificates are used
  to authenticate clients in TLS-based EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client
  is not enforced to be contained in the client's certificate. So clients can authenticate with
  any trusted certificate and claim an arbitrary IKE/EAP identity as their own. This is problematic
  if the identity is used to make policy decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version
  5.9.6 in August 2022 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136).
