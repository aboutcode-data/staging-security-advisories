aliases: []
summary: EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, during the deserialization
  of a `DC_ChargeLoopRes` message that includes Receipt as well as TaxCosts, the vector `<DetailedTax>tax_costs`
  in the target `Receipt` structure is accessed out of bounds. This occurs in the method `template
  <> void convert(const struct iso20_dc_DetailedTaxType& in, datatypes::DetailedTax& out)` which
  leads to a null pointer dereference and causes the module to terminate. The EVerest processes
  and all its modules shut down, affecting all EVSE. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.
