aliases: []
summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration
  capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response
  received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of
  the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that
  returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process
  which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users
  who are authenticated to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket
  protocol. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently
  no known workarounds.
