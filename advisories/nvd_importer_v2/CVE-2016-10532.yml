aliases: []
summary: console-io is a module that allows users to implement a web console in their application.
  A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who
  is running the console-io application 2.2.13 and earlier is able to run. This means that if
  console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. This
  vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure socket.io to require
  authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands
  and receive the response.
