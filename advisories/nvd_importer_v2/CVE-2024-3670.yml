aliases: []
summary: The Leaflet Maps Marker (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing Maps) plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'mapsmarker' shortcode in all
  versions up to, and including, 3.12.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  on user supplied attributes such as 'mapwidthunit'. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
