aliases: []
summary: 'Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root if they have write access
  to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This occurs because of a race condition between
  determining a uid, and the setresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write "ALL
  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a password.
  NOTE: This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. It has been argued that writing
  to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable if you had permission to write to /etc/sudoers. Even
  with write permission to /proc/#####/fd/3, it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers'
