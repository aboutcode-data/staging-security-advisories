  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: phylink: add lock for serializing concurrent pl->phydev writes with resolver

  Currently phylink_resolve() protects itself against concurrent
  phylink_bringup_phy() or phylink_disconnect_phy() calls which modify
  pl->phydev by relying on pl->state_mutex.

  The problem is that in phylink_resolve(), pl->state_mutex is in a lock
  inversion state with pl->phydev->lock. So pl->phydev->lock needs to be
  acquired prior to pl->state_mutex. But that requires dereferencing
  pl->phydev in the first place, and without pl->state_mutex, that is
  racy.

  Hence the reason for the extra lock. Currently it is redundant, but it
  will serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(&phy->lock) will be
  moved outside of the mutex_lock(&pl->state_mutex) section.

  Another alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()
  acquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()
  and phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()
  runs under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when
  calling flush_work(&pl->resolve). Additionally, it would have been
  undesirable because it would have unnecessarily blocked many other call
  paths as well in the entire kernel, so the smaller-scoped lock was
  preferred.
