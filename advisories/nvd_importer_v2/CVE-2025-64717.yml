aliases: []
summary: ZITADEL is an open source identity management platform. Starting in version 2.50.0
  and prior to versions 2.71.19, 3.4.4, and 4.6.6, a vulnerability in ZITADEL's federation process
  allowed auto-linking users from external identity providers to existing users in ZITADEL even
  if the corresponding IdP was not active or if the organization did not allow federated authentication.
  This vulnerability stems from the platform's failure to correctly check or enforce an organization's
  specific security settings during the authentication flow. An Organization Administrator can
  explicitly disable an IdP or disallow federation, but this setting was not being honored during
  the auto-linking process. This allowed an unauthenticated attacker to initiate a login using
  an IdP that should have been disabled for that organization. The platform would incorrectly
  validate the login and, based on a matching criteria, link the attacker's external identity
  to an existing internal user account. This may result in a full Account Takeover, bypassing
  the organization's mandated security controls. Note that accounts with MFA enabled can not
  be taken over by this attack. Also note that only IdPs create on an instance level would allow
  this to work. IdPs registered on another organization would always be denied in the (auto-)linking
  process. Versions 4.6.6, 3.4.4, and 2.71.19 resolve the issue by correctly validating the
  organization's login policy before auto-linking an external user. No known workarounds are
  available aside from upgrading.
