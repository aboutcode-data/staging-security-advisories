aliases: []
summary: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (component upf-epc/pfcpiface)
  up to at least version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. When the UPF receives a PFCP Association
  Setup Request that is missing the mandatory NodeID Information Element, the association setup
  handler dereferences a nil pointer instead of validating the message, causing a panic and
  terminating the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Association Setup Request messages
  to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt
  user-plane services.
