aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. A
  denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an
  attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same
  field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations
  and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request
  to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying
  the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 10.12.0.
