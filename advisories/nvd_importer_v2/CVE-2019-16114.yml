summary: In ATutor 2.2.4, an unauthenticated attacker can change the application settings and
  force it to use his crafted database, which allows him to gain access to the application.
  Next, he can change the directory that the application uploads files to, which allows him
  to achieve remote code execution. This occurs because install/include/header.php does not
  restrict certain changes (to db_host, db_login, db_password, and content_dir) within install/include/step5.php.
