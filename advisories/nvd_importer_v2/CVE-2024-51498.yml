aliases: []
summary: cobalt is a media downloader that doesn't piss you off. A malicious cobalt instance
  could serve links with the `javascript:` protocol, resulting in Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  when the user tries to download an item from a picker. This issue has been present since commit
  `66bac03e`, was mitigated in commit `97977efa` (correctly configured web instances were no
  longer vulnerable) and fully fixed in commit `c4be1d3a` (included in release version 10.2.1).
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should enable a content-security-policy.
