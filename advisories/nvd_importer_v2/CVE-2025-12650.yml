aliases: []
summary: The Simple post listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'class_name' parameter in the postlist shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  0.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page via mouse interaction.
