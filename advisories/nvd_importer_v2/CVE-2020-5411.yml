summary: 'When configured to enable default typing, Jackson contained a deserialization vulnerability
  that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Jackson fixed this vulnerability by blacklisting
  known "deserialization gadgets". Spring Batch configures Jackson with global default typing
  enabled which means that through the previous exploit, arbitrary code could be executed if
  all of the following is true: * Spring Batch''s Jackson support is being leveraged to serialize
  a job''s ExecutionContext. * A malicious user gains write access to the data store used by
  the JobRepository (where the data to be deserialized is stored). In order to protect against
  this type of attack, Jackson prevents a set of untrusted gadget classes from being deserialized.
  Spring Batch should be proactive against blocking unknown "deserialization gadgets" when enabling
  default typing.'
