aliases: []
summary: dd-trace-cpp is the Datadog distributed tracing for C++. When the library fails to
  extract trace context due to malformed unicode, it logs the list of audited headers and their
  values using the `nlohmann` JSON library. However, due to the way the JSON library is invoked,
  it throws an uncaught exception, which results in a crash. This vulnerability has been patched
  in version 0.2.2.
