aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability within the firewall configuration of the Cisco Application Policy
  Infrastructure Controller Enterprise Module (APIC-EM) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
  attacker to gain privileged access to services only available on the internal network of the
  device. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect firewall rule on the device. The misconfiguration
  could allow traffic sent to the public interface of the device to be forwarded to the internal
  virtual network of the APIC-EM. An attacker that is logically adjacent to the network on which
  the public interface of the affected APIC-EM resides could leverage this behavior to gain
  access to services listening on the internal network with elevated privileges. This vulnerability
  affects appliances or virtual devices running Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller
  Enterprise Module prior to version 1.5. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve89638.'
