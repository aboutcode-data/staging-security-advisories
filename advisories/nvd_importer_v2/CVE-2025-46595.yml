aliases: []
summary: 'An XSS issue was discovered in the Flag module before 1.x-3.6.2 for Backdrop CMS.
  Flag is a module that allows flags to be added to nodes, comments, users, and any other type
  of entity. It doesn''t verify flag links before performing the flag action, or verify that
  the response returned was provided by the flag module. This can allow crafted HTML to result
  in Cross Site Scripting. This is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with
  permission to create links on the website, for example: create or edit comments or content
  with a filtered text format.'
