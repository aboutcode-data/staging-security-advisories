aliases: []
summary: Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Versions 1.11.11 and
  below allow TOTP to be used multiple times during its validity window. Users with 2FA enabled
  are prompted to enter a token during sign-in, and afterward it is not sufficiently marked
  as used in the system. This allows an attacker who intercepts that token to use it in addition
  to a known username/password during the 60-second token validity window. The attacker must
  have intercepted a valid 2FA token (for example, during a screen share). This issue is fixed
  in version 1.12.0.
