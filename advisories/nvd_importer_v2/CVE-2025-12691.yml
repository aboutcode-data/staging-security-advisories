summary: The Photonic Gallery & Lightbox for Flickr, SmugMug & Others plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's lightbox functionality in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user

  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses the injected page.
