aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in the GRUB2 bootloader's normal command that poses
  an immediate Denial of Service (DoS) risk. This flaw is a Use-after-Free issue, caused because
  the normal command is not properly unregistered when the module is unloaded. An attacker who
  can execute this command can force the system to access memory locations that are no longer
  valid. Successful exploitation leads directly to system instability, which can result in a
  complete crash and halt system availability. Impact on the data integrity and confidentiality
  is also not discarded.
