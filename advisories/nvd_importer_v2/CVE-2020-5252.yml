aliases: []
summary: 'The command-line "safety" package for Python has a potential security issue. There
  are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code to “poison-pill” command-line Safety
  package detection routines by disguising, or obfuscating, other malicious or non-secure packages.
  This vulnerability is considered to be of low severity because the attack makes use of an
  existing Python condition, not the Safety tool itself. This can happen if: You are running
  Safety in a Python environment that you don’t trust. You are running Safety from the same
  Python environment where you have your dependencies installed. Dependency packages are being
  installed arbitrarily or without proper verification. Users can mitigate this issue by doing
  any of the following: Perform a static analysis by installing Docker and running the Safety
  Docker image: $ docker run --rm -it pyupio/safety check -r requirements.txt Run Safety against
  a static dependencies list, such as the requirements.txt file, in a separate, clean Python
  environment. Run Safety from a Continuous Integration pipeline. Use PyUp.io, which runs Safety
  in a controlled environment and checks Python for dependencies without any need to install
  them. Use PyUp''s Online Requirements Checker.'
