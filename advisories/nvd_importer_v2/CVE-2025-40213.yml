  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: MGMT: fix crash in set_mesh_sync and set_mesh_complete

  There is a BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in set_mesh_sync due to
  memcpy from badly declared on-stack flexible array.

  Another crash is in set_mesh_complete() due to double list_del via
  mgmt_pending_valid + mgmt_pending_remove.

  Use DEFINE_FLEX to declare the flexible array right, and don't memcpy
  outside bounds.

  As mgmt_pending_valid removes the cmd from list, use mgmt_pending_free,
  and also report status on error.
