aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the ms-swift project version
  3.3.0 due to unsafe deserialization in tests/run.py using yaml.load() from the PyYAML library
  (versions = 5.3.1). If an attacker can control the content of the YAML configuration file
  passed to the --run_config parameter, arbitrary code can be executed during deserialization.
  This can lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious YAML
  file is loaded, allowing the execution of arbitrary Python commands such as os.system(). It
  is recommended to upgrade PyYAML to version 5.4 or higher, and to use yaml.safe_load() to
  mitigate the issue.
