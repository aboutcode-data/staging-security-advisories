aliases: []
summary: The Mortgage Lead Capture System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.10. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the 'wprequal_reset_defaults' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
