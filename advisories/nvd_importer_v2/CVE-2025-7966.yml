summary: The Get Youtube Subs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘channel', 'layout', and 'subs_count’ parameters in all versions up to, and including,
  3.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
  scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
