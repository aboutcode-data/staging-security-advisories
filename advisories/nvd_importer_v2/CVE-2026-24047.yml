aliases: []
summary: Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals, and @backstage/cli-common
  provides config loading functionality used by the backend and command line interface of Backstage.
  Prior to version 0.1.17, the `resolveSafeChildPath` utility function in `@backstage/backend-plugin-api`,
  which is used to prevent path traversal attacks, failed to properly validate symlink chains
  and dangling symlinks. An attacker could bypass the path validation via symlink chains (creating
  `link1 → link2 → /outside` where intermediate symlinks eventually resolve outside the allowed
  directory) and dangling symlinks (creating symlinks pointing to non-existent paths outside
  the base directory, which would later be created during file operations). This function is
  used by Scaffolder actions and other backend components to ensure file operations stay within
  designated directories. This vulnerability is fixed in `@backstage/backend-plugin-api` version
  0.1.17. Users should upgrade to this version or later. Some workarounds are available. Run
  Backstage in a containerized environment with limited filesystem access and/or restrict template
  creation to trusted users.
