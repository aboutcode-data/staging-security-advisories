summary: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards
  from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2,
  the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`)
  commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly
  verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally
  designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security
  threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this
  bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process
  prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use
  of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2
  and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.
