aliases: []
summary: The PopupKit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user
  is authorized to access the /popup/logs REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read and delete analytics data including
  device types, browser information, countries, referrer URLs, and campaign metrics.
