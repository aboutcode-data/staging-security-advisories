  veth: reduce XDP no_direct return section to fix race

  As explain in commit fa349e396e48 ("veth: Fix race with AF_XDP exposing
  old or uninitialized descriptors") for veth there is a chance after
  napi_complete_done() that another CPU can manage start another NAPI
  instance running veth_pool(). For NAPI this is correctly handled as the
  napi_schedule_prep() check will prevent multiple instances from getting
  scheduled, but for the remaining code in veth_pool() this can run
  concurrent with the newly started NAPI instance.

  The problem/race is that xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct() isn't
  designed to be nested.

  Prior to commit 401cb7dae813 ("net: Reference bpf_redirect_info via
  task_struct on PREEMPT_RT.") the temporary BPF net context
  bpf_redirect_info was stored per CPU, where this wasn't an issue. Since
  this commit the BPF context is stored in 'current' task_struct. When
  running veth in threaded-NAPI mode, then the kthread becomes the storage
  area. Now a race exists between two concurrent veth_pool() function calls
  one exiting NAPI and one running new NAPI, both using the same BPF net
  context.

  Race is when another CPU gets within the xdp_set_return_frame_no_direct()
  section before exiting veth_pool() calls the clear-function
  xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct().
