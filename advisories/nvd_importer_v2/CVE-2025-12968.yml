aliases: []
summary: The Infility Global plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation and capability checks in all versions up to, and including,
  2.14.23. This is due to the `upload_file` function in the `infility_import_file` class only
  validating the MIME type which can be easily spoofed, and the `import_data` function missing
  capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
