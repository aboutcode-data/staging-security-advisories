aliases: []
summary: Firefly III is a free and open source personal finance manager. In affected versions
  an MFA bypass in the Firefly III OAuth flow may allow malicious users to bypass the MFA-check.
  This allows malicious users to use password spraying to gain access to Firefly III data using
  passwords stolen from other sources. As OAuth applications are easily enumerable using an
  incrementing id, an attacker could try sign an OAuth application up to a users profile quite
  easily if they have created one. The attacker would also need to know the victims username
  and password. This problem has been patched in Firefly III v6.1.17 and up. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should Use a unique password for their Firefly III instance
  and store their password securely, i.e. in a password manager.
