aliases: []
summary: Twig is a template language for PHP. In a sandbox, an attacker can access attributes
  of Array-like objects as they were not checked by the security policy. They are now checked
  via the property policy and the `__isset()` method is now called after the security check.
  This is a BC break. This issue has been patched in versions 3.11.2 and 3.14.1. All users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
