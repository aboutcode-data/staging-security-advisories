aliases: []
summary: Netwrix Auditor before 9.8 has insecure permissions on %PROGRAMDATA%\Netwrix Auditor\Logs\ActiveDirectory\
  and sub-folders. In addition, the service Netwrix.ADA.StorageAuditService (which writes to
  that directory) does not perform proper impersonation, and thus the target file will have
  the same permissions as the invoking process (in this case, granting Authenticated Users full
  access over the target file). This vulnerability can be triggered by a low-privileged user
  to perform DLL Hijacking/Binary Planting attacks and ultimately execute code as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  with the help of Symbolic Links.
