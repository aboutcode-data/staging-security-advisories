summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the restart_program function
  of the parisneo/lollms-webui v9.6. This vulnerability allows attackers to trick users into
  performing unintended actions, such as resetting the program without their knowledge, by sending
  specially crafted CSRF forms. This issue affects the installation process, including the installation
  of Binding zoo and Models zoo, by unexpectedly resetting programs. The vulnerability is due
  to the lack of CSRF protection in the affected function.
