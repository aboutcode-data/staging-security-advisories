  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: dsa: don't leak tagger-owned storage on switch driver unbind

  In the initial commit dc452a471dba ("net: dsa: introduce tagger-owned
  storage for private and shared data"), we had a call to
  tag_ops->disconnect(dst) issued from dsa_tree_free(), which is called at
  tree teardown time.

  There were problems with connecting to a switch tree as a whole, so this
  got reworked to connecting to individual switches within the tree. In
  this process, tag_ops->disconnect(ds) was made to be called only from
  switch.c (cross-chip notifiers emitted as a result of dynamic tag proto
  changes), but the normal driver teardown code path wasn't replaced with
  anything.

  Solve this problem by adding a function that does the opposite of
  dsa_switch_setup_tag_protocol(), which is called from the equivalent
  spot in dsa_switch_teardown(). The positioning here also ensures that we
  won't have any use-after-free in tagging protocol (*rcv) ops, since the
  teardown sequence is as follows:

  dsa_tree_teardown
  -> dsa_tree_teardown_master
     -> dsa_master_teardown
        -> unsets master->dsa_ptr, making no further packets match the
           ETH_P_XDSA packet type handler
  -> dsa_tree_teardown_ports
     -> dsa_port_teardown
        -> dsa_slave_destroy
           -> unregisters DSA net devices, there is even a synchronize_net()
              in unregister_netdevice_many()
  -> dsa_tree_teardown_switches
     -> dsa_switch_teardown
        -> dsa_switch_teardown_tag_protocol
           -> finally frees the tagger-owned storage
