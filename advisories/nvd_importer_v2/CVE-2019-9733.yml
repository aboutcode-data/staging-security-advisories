aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in JFrog Artifactory 6.7.3. By default, the access-admin account
  is used to reset the password of the admin account in case an administrator gets locked out
  from the Artifactory console. This is only allowable from a connection directly from localhost,
  but providing a X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to the request allows an unauthenticated user
  to login with the default credentials of the access-admin account while bypassing the whitelist
  of allowed IP addresses. The access-admin account can use Artifactory's API to request authentication
  tokens for all users including the admin account and, in turn, assume full control of all
  artifacts and repositories managed by Artifactory.
