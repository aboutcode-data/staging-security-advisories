aliases: []
summary: Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of data for operating
  systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 but prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and
  configured for PAM authentication, a failed PAM authentication will leak a small amount of
  memory. An attacker that is able to use the PAM Console (i.e. by knowing the shared secret
  or via the WebUI) can flood the Director with failing login attempts which will eventually
  lead to an out-of-memory condition in which the Director will not work anymore. Bareos Director
  versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 contain a Bugfix for this problem. Users who are unable
  to upgrade may disable PAM authentication as a workaround.
