aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the meeting-join functionality of Cisco Webex Meetings could have\
  \ allowed an unauthenticated, network-proximate attacker to complete a meeting-join process\
  \ in place of an intended targeted user, provided the requisite conditions were satisfied.\
  \ Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer\
  \ action is needed.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability existed due to client certificate validation\
  \ issues. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this\
  \ vulnerability by monitoring local wireless or adjacent networks for client-join requests\
  \ and attempting to interrupt and complete the meeting-join flow as another user who was currently\
  \ joining a meeting. To successfully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need the\
  \ capability to position themselves in a local wireless or adjacent network, to monitor and\
  \ intercept the targeted network traffic flows, and to satisfy timing requirements in order\
  \ to interrupt the meeting-join flow and exploit the vulnerability. A successful exploit could\
  \ have allowed the attacker to join the meeting as another user. However, the Cisco Product\
  \ Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability\
  \ that is described in this advisory."
