summary: A certain software build for the Sharp Rouvo V device (SHARP/VZW_STTM21VAPP/STTM21VAPP:12/SP1A.210812.016/1KN0_0_530:user/release-keys)
  leaks the Wi-Fi MAC address and the Bluetooth MAC address to system properties that can be
  accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google
  restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android
  10 and higher, but in this instance they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be
  obtained indirectly. This malicious app reads from the "ro.boot.wifi_mac" system property
  to indirectly obtain the Wi-Fi MAC address and reads the "ro.boot.bt_mac" system property
  to obtain the Bluetooth MAC address.
