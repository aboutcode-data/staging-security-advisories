  drm/sched: Fix deadlock in drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb

  The Mesa issue referenced below pointed out a possible deadlock:

  [ 1231.611031]  Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:

  [ 1231.611033]        CPU0                    CPU1
  [ 1231.611034]        ----                    ----
  [ 1231.611035]   lock(&xa->xa_lock#17);
  [ 1231.611038]                                local_irq_disable();
  [ 1231.611039]                                lock(&fence->lock);
  [ 1231.611041]                                lock(&xa->xa_lock#17);
  [ 1231.611044]   <Interrupt>
  [ 1231.611045]     lock(&fence->lock);
  [ 1231.611047]
                  *** DEADLOCK ***

  In this example, CPU0 would be any function accessing job->dependencies
  through the xa_* functions that don't disable interrupts (eg:
  drm_sched_job_add_dependency(), drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()).

  CPU1 is executing drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb() as a fence signalling
  callback so in an interrupt context. It will deadlock when trying to
  grab the xa_lock which is already held by CPU0.

  Replacing all xa_* usage by their xa_*_irq counterparts would fix
  this issue, but Christian pointed out another issue: dma_fence_signal
  takes fence.lock and so does dma_fence_add_callback.

    dma_fence_signal() // locks f1.lock
    -> drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()
    -> foreach dependencies
       -> dma_fence_add_callback() // locks f2.lock

  This will deadlock if f1 and f2 share the same spinlock.

  To fix both issues, the code iterating on dependencies and re-arming them
  is moved out to drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work().
