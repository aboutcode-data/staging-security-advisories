aliases: []
summary: 'TorchServe is a flexible and easy-to-use tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models
  in production. TorchServe ''s check on allowed_urls configuration can be by-passed if the
  URL contains characters such as ".." but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded
  into the model store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing a
  URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls security check. Customers
  using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are
  not affected. This issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the URL without characters
  such as ".." before downloading see PR #3082. TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to
  address this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability.'
