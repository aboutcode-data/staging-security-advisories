summary: 'runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification.
  In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following
  conditons: 1. when runc is executed inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does
  not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`,
  with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is executed outside the user namespace,
  and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very
  rare). A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...`
  on the host . Other users''s cgroup hierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade
  to version 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl)
  run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup
  v2 hosts. or add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`.'
