summary: 'Open source machine learning framework. A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa
  that enables an attacker who has the ability to load a maliciously crafted model remotely
  into a Rasa instance to achieve Remote Code Execution. The prerequisites for this are: 1.
  The HTTP API must be enabled on the Rasa instance eg with `--enable-api`. This is not the
  default configuration. 2. For unauthenticated RCE to be exploitable, the user must not have
  configured any authentication or other security controls recommended in our documentation.
  3. For authenticated RCE, the attacker must posses a valid authentication token or JWT to
  interact with the Rasa API. This issue has been addressed in rasa version 3.6.21 and all users
  are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that they require authentication
  and that only trusted users are given access.'
