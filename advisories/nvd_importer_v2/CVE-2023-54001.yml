summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  staging: r8712: Fix memory leak in _r8712_init_xmit_priv()

  In the above mentioned routine, memory is allocated in several places.
  If the first succeeds and a later one fails, the routine will leak memory.
  This patch fixes commit 2865d42c78a9 ("staging: r8712u: Add the new driver
  to the mainline kernel"). A potential memory leak in
  r8712_xmit_resource_alloc() is also addressed.
