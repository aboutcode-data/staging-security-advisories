aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. Management protocol
  has a flow which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Bash code with root privileges.
  The command that sets the hostname doesn't validate input parameters. As a result, arbitrary
  data goes directly to the Bash interpreter. An attacker would need credentials to exploit
  this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.
