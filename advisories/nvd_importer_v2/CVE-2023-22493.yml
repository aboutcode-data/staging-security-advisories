summary: RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. RSSHub is vulnerable to Server-Side Request
  Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests
  from the server to other servers or resources on the network. An attacker can exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a request to the affected routes with a malicious URL. An attacker
  could also use this vulnerability to send requests to internal or any other servers or resources
  on the network, potentially gain access to sensitive information that would not normally be
  accessible and amplifying the impact of the attack. The patch for this issue can be found
  in commit a66cbcf.
