  staging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in OnBeacon ESR IE parsing

  The Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed
  *(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these
  offsets lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with
  an ESR IE positioned at the end of the buffer could cause an
  out-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.

  Add a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body and the subsequent
  bytes are within the limits of the frame before attempting to access
  them.

  This prevents OOB reads caused by malformed beacon frames.
