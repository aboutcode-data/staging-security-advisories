summary: The Big Post Shipping for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'wooboigpost_shipping_status' shortcode in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
