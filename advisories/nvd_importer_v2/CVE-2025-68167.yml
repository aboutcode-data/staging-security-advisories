  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpiolib: fix invalid pointer access in debugfs

  If the memory allocation in gpiolib_seq_start() fails, the s->private
  field remains uninitialized and is later dereferenced without checking
  in gpiolib_seq_stop(). Initialize s->private to NULL before calling
  kzalloc() and check it before dereferencing it.
