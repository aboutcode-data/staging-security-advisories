aliases: []
summary: 'An untrusted search path (aka DLL Preloading) vulnerability in the Cisco Immunet antimalware
  installer could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code via DLL hijacking
  if a local user with administrative privileges executes the installer in the current working
  directory where a crafted DLL has been placed by an attacker. The vulnerability is due to
  incomplete input validation of path and file names of a DLL file before it is loaded. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious DLL file and installing it in a specific
  system directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the
  underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to the SYSTEM account. An attacker
  would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf23928.'
