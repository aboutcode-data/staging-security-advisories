aliases: []
summary: The MyRewards – Loyalty Points and Rewards for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.0. This is due
  to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the
  'ajax' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level
  access and above, to modify, add, or delete loyalty program earning rules, including manipulating
  point multipliers to arbitrary values.
