aliases: []
summary: A NoSQL injection vulnerability in Adapt Learning Adapt Authoring Tool <= 0.11.3 allows
  unauthenticated attackers to reset user and administrator account passwords via the "Reset
  password" feature. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of user input,
  which is used as a query in Mongoose's find() function. This makes it possible for attackers
  to perform a full takeover of the administrator account. Attackers can then use the newly
  gained administrative privileges to upload a custom plugin to perform remote code execution
  (RCE) on the server hosting the web application.
