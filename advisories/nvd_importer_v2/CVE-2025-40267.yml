summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/rw: ensure allocated iovec gets cleared for early failure

  A previous commit reused the recyling infrastructure for early cleanup,
  but this is not enough for the case where our internal caches have
  overflowed. If this happens, then the allocated iovec can get leaked if
  the request is also aborted early.

  Reinstate the previous forced free of the iovec for that situation.
