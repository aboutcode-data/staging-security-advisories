aliases: []
summary: 'Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime.
  In versions prior to 4.9.7, a flaw in the `bodyLimit` middleware could allow bypassing the
  configured request body size limit when conflicting HTTP headers were present. The middleware
  previously prioritized the `Content-Length` header even when a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
  header was also included. According to the HTTP specification, `Content-Length` must be ignored
  in such cases. This discrepancy could allow oversized request bodies to bypass the configured
  limit. Most standards-compliant runtimes and reverse proxies may reject such malformed requests
  with `400 Bad Request`, so the practical impact depends on the runtime and deployment environment.
  If body size limits are used as a safeguard against large or malicious requests, this flaw
  could allow attackers to send oversized request bodies. The primary risk is denial of service
  (DoS) due to excessive memory or CPU consumption when handling very large requests. The implementation
  has been updated to align with the HTTP specification, ensuring that `Transfer-Encoding` takes
  precedence over `Content-Length`. The issue is fixed in Hono v4.9.7, and all users should
  upgrade immediately.'
