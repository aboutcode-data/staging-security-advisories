aliases: []
summary: "Attackers with local access to the medical office computer can \nescalate their Windows\
  \ user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by \noverwriting one of two Elefant service\
  \ binaries with weak permissions. The default installation directory of Elefant is \"C:\\\
  Elefant1\" which is \nwritable for all users. In addition, the Elefant installer registers\
  \ two\n Firebird database services which are running as “NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM”. \n\nPath:\
  \ C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbserver.exe\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbguard.exe\n\
  \n\nBoth service binaries are user writable. This means that a local \nattacker can rename\
  \ one of the service binaries, replace the service \nexecutable with a new executable, and\
  \ then restart the system. Once the \nsystem has rebooted, the new service binary is executed\
  \ as \"NT \nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"."
