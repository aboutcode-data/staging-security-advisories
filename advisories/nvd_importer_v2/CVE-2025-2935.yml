summary: 'The Anti-Spam: Spam Protection | Block Spam Users, Comments, Forms plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2024.7.
  This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the ''ss_option_maint.php'' and ''ss_user_filter_list''
  files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete pending comments, and
  re-enable a previously blocked user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.'
