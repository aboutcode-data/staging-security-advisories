aliases: []
summary: API Platform Core is a system to create hypermedia-driven REST and GraphQL APIs. Starting
  in version 3.3.8, a security check that gets called after GraphQl resolvers is always replaced
  by another one as there's no break in a clause. As this falls back to `security`, the impact
  is there only when there's only a security after resolver and none inside security. Version
  3.3.15 contains a patch for the issue.
