aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest
  1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample
  rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance.
  The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from
  1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed
  by the instance manager.
