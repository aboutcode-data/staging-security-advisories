aliases: []
summary: The WP Restaurant Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'align' parameter of the restaurant_summary shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
