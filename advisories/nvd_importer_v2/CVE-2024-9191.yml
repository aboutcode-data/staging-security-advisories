  The Okta Device Access features, provided by the Okta Verify agent for Windows, provides access to the OktaDeviceAccessPipe, which enables attackers in a compromised device to retrieve passwords associated with Desktop MFA passwordless logins. The vulnerability was discovered via routine penetration testing.
