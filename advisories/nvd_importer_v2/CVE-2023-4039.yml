aliases: []
summary: "**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains \n\
  that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer \noverflow in dynamically-sized\
  \ local variables in your application \nwithout this being detected. This stack-protector\
  \ failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using\
  \ \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\
  \nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your\
  \ application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit\
  \ a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram\
  \ flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect\
  \ confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening\
  \ bug and not a vulnerability by itself."
