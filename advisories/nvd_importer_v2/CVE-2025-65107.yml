aliases: []
summary: Langfuse is an open source large language model engineering platform. In versions from
  2.95.0 to before 2.95.12 and from 3.17.0 to before 3.131.0, in SSO provider configurations
  without an explicit AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK setting, a potential account takeover may happen
  if an authenticated user is made to call a specifically crafted URL via a CSRF or phishing
  attack. This issue has been patched in versions 2.95.12 and 3.131.0. A workaround for this
  issue involves setting AUTH_<PROVIDER>_CHECK.
