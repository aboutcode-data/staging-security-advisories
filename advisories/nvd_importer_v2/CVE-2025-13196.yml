aliases: []
summary: The Element Pack Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the Open Street Map widget's marker content parameter in all versions
  up to, and including, 8.3.4. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  on user-supplied attributes in the render function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
