aliases: []
summary: 'A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Broker-J 7.0.0 in functionality
  for authentication of connections for AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9, 0-91 and 0-10 when PLAIN or
  XOAUTH2 SASL mechanism is used. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker to crash
  the broker instance. AMQP 1.0 and HTTP connections are not affected. An authentication of
  incoming AMQP connections in Apache Qpid Broker-J is performed by special entities called
  "Authentication Providers". Each Authentication Provider can support several SASL mechanisms
  which are offered to the connecting clients as part of SASL negotiation process. The client
  chooses the most appropriate SASL mechanism for authentication. Authentication Providers of
  following types supports PLAIN SASL mechanism: Plain, PlainPasswordFile, SimpleLDAP, Base64MD5PasswordFile,
  MD5, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-1. XOAUTH2 SASL mechanism is supported by Authentication Providers
  of type OAuth2. If an AMQP port is configured with any of these Authentication Providers,
  the Broker may be vulnerable.'
