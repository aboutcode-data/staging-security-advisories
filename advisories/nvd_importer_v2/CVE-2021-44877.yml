summary: Dalmark Systems Systeam 2.22.8 build 1724 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control.
  The Systeam application is an ERP system that uses a mixed architecture based on SaaS tenant
  and user management, and on-premise database and web application counterparts. A broken access
  control vulnerability has been found while using a temporary generated token in order to consume
  api resources. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to use an api endpoint
  to generate a temporary JWT token that is designed to reference the correct tenant prior to
  authentication, to request system configuration parameters using direct api requests. The
  correct exploitation of this vulnerability causes sensitive information exposure. In case
  the tenant has an smtp credential set, the full credential information is disclosed.
