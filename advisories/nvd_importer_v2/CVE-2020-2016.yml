summary: 'A race condition due to insecure creation of a file in a temporary directory vulnerability
  in PAN-OS allows for root privilege escalation from a limited linux user account. This allows
  an attacker who has escaped the restricted shell as a low privilege administrator, possibly
  by exploiting another vulnerability, to escalate privileges to become root user. This issue
  affects: PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than 7.1.26; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.13;
  PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6; All versions of PAN-OS 8.0.'
