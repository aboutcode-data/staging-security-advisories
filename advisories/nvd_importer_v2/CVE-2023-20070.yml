aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the TLS 1.3 implementation of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 detection
  engine to unexpectedly restart. This vulnerability is due to a logic error in how memory allocations
  are handled during a TLS 1.3 session. Under specific, time-based constraints, an attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS 1.3 message sequence through an
  affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort 3 detection
  engine to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. While the Snort detection
  engine reloads, packets going through the FTD device that are sent to the Snort detection
  engine will be dropped. The Snort detection engine will restart automatically. No manual intervention
  is required.
