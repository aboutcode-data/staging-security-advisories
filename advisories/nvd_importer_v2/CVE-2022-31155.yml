aliases: []
summary: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions
  before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users’ saved searches due to
  a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users’
  saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched
  in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure
  version is highly recommended.
