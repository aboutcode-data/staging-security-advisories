aliases: []
summary: 'Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in PHP 5.3.17,
  when installed in the top-level C:\ directory, might allow local users to gain privileges
  via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\PHP directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment
  variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by
  the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server
  2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because
  the unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action that is not a default
  part of the PHP installation'
