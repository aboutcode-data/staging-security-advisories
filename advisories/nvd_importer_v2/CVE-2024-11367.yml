aliases: []
summary: The Smoove connector for Elementor forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected
  Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
