aliases: []
summary: In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.40.0.4, an exposure of sensitive information vulnerability
  exists due to an arbitrary system path lookup feature. This vulnerability allows any remote
  user to view full paths in the entire file system where h2o-3 is hosted. Specifically, the
  issue resides in the Typeahead API call, which when requested with a typeahead lookup of '/',
  exposes the root filesystem including directories such as /home, /usr, /bin, among others.
  This vulnerability could allow attackers to explore the entire filesystem, and when combined
  with a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, could make exploitation of the server trivial.
