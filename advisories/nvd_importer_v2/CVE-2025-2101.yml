aliases: []
summary: The Edumall theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.2.4 via the 'template' parameter of the 'edumall_lazy_load_template'
  AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary
  PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be
  used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases
  where PHP files can be uploaded and included.
