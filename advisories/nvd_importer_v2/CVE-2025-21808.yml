  net: xdp: Disallow attaching device-bound programs in generic mode

  Device-bound programs are used to support RX metadata kfuncs. These
  kfuncs are driver-specific and rely on the driver context to read the
  metadata. This means they can't work in generic XDP mode. However, there
  is no check to disallow such programs from being attached in generic
  mode, in which case the metadata kfuncs will be called in an invalid
  context, leading to crashes.

  Fix this by adding a check to disallow attaching device-bound programs
  in generic mode.
