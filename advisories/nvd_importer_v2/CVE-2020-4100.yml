summary: '"HCL Verse for Android was found to employ dynamic code loading. This mechanism allows
  a developer to specify which components of the application should not be loaded by default
  when the application is started. Typically, core components and additional dependencies are
  loaded natively at runtime; however, dynamically loaded components are only loaded as they
  are specifically requested. While this can have a positive impact on performance, or grant
  additional functionality (for example, a non-invasive update feature), it can also open the
  application to loading unintended code if not implemented properly."'
