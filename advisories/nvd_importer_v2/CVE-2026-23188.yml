  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: usb: r8152: fix resume reset deadlock

  rtl8152 can trigger device reset during reset which
  potentially can result in a deadlock:

   **** DPM device timeout after 10 seconds; 15 seconds until panic ****
   Call Trace:
   <TASK>
   schedule+0x483/0x1370
   schedule_preempt_disabled+0x15/0x30
   __mutex_lock_common+0x1fd/0x470

   usb_resume_interface+0x3e/0xc0
   usb_resume_both+0x104/0x150
   usb_resume+0x22/0x110

  The problem is that rtl8152 resume calls reset under
  tp->control mutex while reset basically re-enters rtl8152
  and attempts to acquire the same tp->control lock once
  again.

  Reset INACCESSIBLE device outside of tp->control mutex
  scope to avoid recursive mutex_lock() deadlock.
