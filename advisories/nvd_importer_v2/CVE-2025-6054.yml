aliases: []
summary: The YANewsflash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'yanewsflash/yanewsflash.php' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
