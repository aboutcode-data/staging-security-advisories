  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  f2fs: check discard support for conventional zones

  As the helper function f2fs_bdev_support_discard() shows, f2fs checks if
  the target block devices support discard by calling
  bdev_max_discard_sectors() and bdev_is_zoned(). This check works well
  for most cases, but it does not work for conventional zones on zoned
  block devices. F2fs assumes that zoned block devices support discard,
  and calls __submit_discard_cmd(). When __submit_discard_cmd() is called
  for sequential write required zones, it works fine since
  __submit_discard_cmd() issues zone reset commands instead of discard
  commands. However, when __submit_discard_cmd() is called for
  conventional zones, __blkdev_issue_discard() is called even when the
  devices do not support discard.

  The inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call was not a problem before
  the commit 30f1e7241422 ("block: move discard checks into the ioctl
  handler") because __blkdev_issue_discard() checked if the target devices
  support discard or not. If not, it returned EOPNOTSUPP. After the
  commit, __blkdev_issue_discard() no longer checks it. It always returns
  zero and sets NULL to the given bio pointer. This NULL pointer triggers
  f2fs_bug_on() in __submit_discard_cmd(). The BUG is recreated with the
  commands below at the umount step, where /dev/nullb0 is a zoned null_blk
  with 5GB total size, 128MB zone size and 10 conventional zones.

  $ mkfs.f2fs -f -m /dev/nullb0
  $ mount /dev/nullb0 /mnt
  $ for ((i=0;i<5;i++)); do dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test bs=65536 count=1600 conv=fsync; done
  $ umount /mnt

  To fix the BUG, avoid the inappropriate __blkdev_issue_discard() call.
  When discard is requested for conventional zones, check if the device
  supports discard or not. If not, return EOPNOTSUPP.
