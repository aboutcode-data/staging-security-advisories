aliases: []
summary: XWiki Rendering is a generic Rendering system that converts textual input in a given
  syntax into another syntax. The cleaning of attributes during XHTML rendering, introduced
  in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting
  via invalid attribute names. This can be exploited, e.g., via the link syntax in any content
  that supports XWiki syntax like comments in XWiki. When a user moves the mouse over a malicious
  link, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. When this
  user is a privileged user who has programming rights, this allows server-side code execution
  with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the
  XWiki instance. While this attribute was correctly recognized as not allowed, the attribute
  was still printed with a prefix `data-xwiki-translated-attribute-` without further cleaning
  or validation. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by removing characters
  not allowed in data attributes and then validating the cleaned attribute again. There are
  no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.
