aliases: []
summary: |
  Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory
  Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for
  Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically used
  for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.

  Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a device
  associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regions
  need to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logic
  establishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting in
  such mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have been
  removed again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memory
  regions which they aren't supposed to have access to.
