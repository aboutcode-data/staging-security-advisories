aliases: []
summary: 'The NFS client implementation in the kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3,
  when a filesystem is mounted with the noacl option, checks permissions for the open system
  call via vfs_permission (mode bits) data rather than an NFS ACCESS call to the server, which
  allows local client processes to obtain a false success status from open calls that the server
  would deny, and possibly obtain sensitive information about file permissions on the server,
  as demonstrated in a root_squash environment.  NOTE: it is uncertain whether any scenarios
  involving this issue cross privilege boundaries.'
