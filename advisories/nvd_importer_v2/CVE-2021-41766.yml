aliases: []
summary: Apache Karaf allows monitoring of applications and the Java runtime by using the Java
  Management Extensions (JMX). JMX is a Java RMI based technology that relies on Java serialized
  objects for client server communication. Whereas the default JMX implementation is hardened
  against unauthenticated deserialization attacks, the implementation used by Apache Karaf is
  not protected against this kind of attack. The impact of Java deserialization vulnerabilities
  strongly depends on the classes that are available within the targets class path. Generally
  speaking, deserialization of untrusted data does always represent a high security risk and
  should be prevented. The risk is low as, by default, Karaf uses a limited set of classes in
  the JMX server class path. It depends of system scoped classes (e.g. jar in the lib folder).
