aliases: []
summary: Jenkins Build-Publisher plugin version 1.21 and earlier stores credentials to other
  Jenkins instances in the file hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml in the Jenkins
  master home directory. These credentials were stored unencrypted, allowing anyone with local
  file system access to access them. Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in
  plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the credentials
  through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
