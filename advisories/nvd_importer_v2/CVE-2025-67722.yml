summary: FreePBX is an open-source web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that manages Asterisk.
  Prior to versions 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 of the FreePBX framework, an authenticated local privilege
  escalation exists in the deprecated FreePBX startup script `amportal`. In the deprecated `amportal`
  utility, the lookup for the `freepbx_engine` file occurs in `/etc/asterisk/` directories.
  Typically, these are configured by FreePBX as writable by the **asterisk** user and any members
  of the **asterisk** group. This means that a member of the **asterisk** group can add their
  own `freepbx_engine` file in `/etc/asterisk/` and upon `amportal` executing, it would exec
  that file with root permissions (even though the file was created and placed by a non-root
  user). Version 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 contain a fix for the issue. Other mitigation strategies
  are also available. Confirm only trusted local OS system users are members of the `asterisk`
  group. Look for suspicious files in the `/etc/asterisk/` directory (via Admin -> Config Edit
  in the GUI, or via CLI). Double-check that `live_dangerously = no` is set (or unconfigured,
  as the default is **no**) in `/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf` file. Eliminate any unsafe custom
  use of Asterisk dial plan applications and functions that potentially can manipulate the file
  system, e.g., System(), FILE(), etc.
