aliases: []
summary: Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple
  SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases.
  User input coming from the `db_name` in the `sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_list` endpoint
  is passed to the methods that follow in a given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate
  user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each
  database engine for execution. The affected methods are `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which
  passes unsafe user input to `sql/engines/mssql.py`, and `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which
  concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py`
  `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared
  statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-105`.
