aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting
  with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal
  bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only
  repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD
  user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft
  an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents
  of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds
  file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from
  a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know
  or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files
  from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files
  on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0.
  The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted
  Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are
  requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application.
  There are currently no known workarounds.
