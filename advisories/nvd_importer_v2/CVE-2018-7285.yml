aliases: []
summary: A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through 15.2.1. The RTP
  support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic codecs and desired payload numbers.
  While an SDP negotiation may result in a codec using a different payload number, these desired
  ones are still stored internally. When an RTP packet was received, this registry would be
  consulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP. This registry was incorrectly
  consulted for all packets, even those which are dynamic. If the payload number resulted in
  a codec of a different type than the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted
  in a video codec but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no stream of that type
  had been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly assuming that a stream of that type
  would always exist.
