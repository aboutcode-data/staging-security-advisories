aliases: []
summary: Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In versions
  before 14.2.31 and from 15.0.0 to before 15.4.5, Next.js Image Optimization API routes are
  affected by cache key confusion. When images returned from API routes vary based on request
  headers (such as Cookie or Authorization), these responses could be incorrectly cached and
  served to unauthorized users due to a cache key confusion bug. This vulnerability has been
  fixed in Next.js versions 14.2.31 and 15.4.5. All users are encouraged to upgrade if they
  use API routes to serve images that depend on request headers and have image optimization
  enabled.
