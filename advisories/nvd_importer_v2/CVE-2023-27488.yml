summary: "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.\
  \ Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, escalation of privileges is\
  \ possible when `failure_mode_allow: true` is configured for `ext_authz` filter. For affected\
  \ components that are used for logging and/or visibility, requests may not be logged by the\
  \ receiving service.\n\nWhen Envoy was configured to use ext_authz, ext_proc, tap, ratelimit\
  \ filters, and grpc access log service and an http header with non-UTF-8 data was received,\
  \ Envoy would generate an invalid protobuf message and send it to the configured service.\
  \ The receiving service would typically generate an error when decoding the protobuf message.\
  \ For ext_authz that was configured with ``failure_mode_allow: true``, the request would have\
  \ been allowed in this case. For the other services, this could have resulted in other unforeseen\
  \ errors such as a lack of visibility into requests. \n\nAs of versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4,\
  \ 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, Envoy by default sanitizes the values sent in gRPC service calls to\
  \ be valid UTF-8, replacing data that is not valid UTF-8 with a `!` character. This behavioral\
  \ change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard `envoy.reloadable_features.service_sanitize_non_utf8_strings`\
  \ to false. As a workaround, one may set `failure_mode_allow: false` for `ext_authz`."
