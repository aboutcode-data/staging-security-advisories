  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  be2net: Fix NULL pointer dereference in be_cmd_get_mac_from_list

  When the parameter pmac_id_valid argument of be_cmd_get_mac_from_list() is
  set to false, the driver may request the PMAC_ID from the firmware of the
  network card, and this function will store that PMAC_ID at the provided
  address pmac_id. This is the contract of this function.

  However, there is a location within the driver where both
  pmac_id_valid == false and pmac_id == NULL are being passed. This could
  result in dereferencing a NULL pointer.

  To resolve this issue, it is necessary to pass the address of a stub
  variable to the function.
