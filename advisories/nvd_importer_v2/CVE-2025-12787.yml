aliases: []
summary: The Hydra Booking — Appointment Scheduling & Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to unauthorized booking cancellation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.27.
  This is due to the plugin's "tfhb_meeting_form_submit_callback" function using insufficiently
  random values to generate booking cancellation tokens, combined with a globally shared nonce.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to cancel arbitrary bookings via brute
  force attacks against the tfhb_meeting_form_cencel AJAX endpoint.
