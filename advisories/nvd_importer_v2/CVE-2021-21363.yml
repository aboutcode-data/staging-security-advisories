aliases: []
summary: swagger-codegen is an open-source project which contains a template-driven engine to
  generate documentation, API clients and server stubs in different languages by parsing your
  OpenAPI / Swagger definition. In swagger-codegen before version 2.4.19, on Unix like systems,
  the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated
  user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary
  directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. This vulnerability
  is local privilege escalation because the contents of the `outputFolder` can be appended to
  by an attacker. As such, code written to this directory, when executed can be attacker controlled.
  For more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory. This vulnerability is fixed
  in version 2.4.19. Note this is a distinct vulnerability from CVE-2021-21364.
