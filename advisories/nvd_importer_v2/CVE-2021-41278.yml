aliases: []
summary: Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers
  to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In
  affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk “AES” transform in EdgeX Foundry
  releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The
  app-functions-sdk exports an “aes” transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt
  data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled
  by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due
  to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2
  deprecates the “aes” transform and provides an improved “aes256” transform in its place. The
  broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX
  major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation.
  As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do
  not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected
  are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the
  new "aes256" transform.
