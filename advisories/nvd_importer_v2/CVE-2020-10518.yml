aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that
  could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration of the
  underlying parsers used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible
  to execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise
  Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior
  to 2.22 and was fixed in 2.21.6, 2.20.15, and 2.19.21. The underlying issues contributing
  to this vulnerability were identified both internally and through the GitHub Security Bug
  Bounty program.
