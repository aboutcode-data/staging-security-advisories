summary: The Peer Publish plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the website
  management pages. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add, modify, or
  delete website configurations via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
