aliases: []
summary: 'Emlog is an open source website building system. Versions up to and including 2.5.19
  are vulnerable to server-side Out-of-Band (OOB) requests / SSRF via uploaded SVG files. An
  attacker can upload a crafted SVG to http[:]//emblog/admin/media[.]php which contains external
  resource references. When the server processes/renders the SVG (thumbnailing, preview, or
  sanitization), it issues an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled host. Impact: server-side
  SSRF/OOB leading to internal network probing and potential metadata/credential exposure. As
  of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.'
