aliases: []
summary: A malicious DLL preload attack possible on NwSapSetup and Installation self-extracting
  program for SAP Plant Connectivity 2.3 and 15.0. It is possible that SAPSetup / NwSapSetup.exe
  loads system DLLs like DWMAPI.dll (located in your Syswow64 / System32 folder) from the folder
  the executable is in and not from the system location. The desired behavior is that system
  dlls are only loaded from the system folders. If a dll with the same name as the system dll
  is located in the same folder as the executable, this dll is loaded and code is executed.
