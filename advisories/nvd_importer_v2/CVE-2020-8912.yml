aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the in-band key negotiation exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for
  GoLang versions prior to V2. An attacker with write access to the targeted bucket can change
  the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can then allow them to change AES-GCM
  to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication
  key used by AES-GCM as decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as
  an algebraic equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt
  your files.
