summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: tegra210-quad: Protect curr_xfer in tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer

  The curr_xfer field is read by the IRQ handler without holding the lock
  to check if a transfer is in progress. When clearing curr_xfer in the
  combined sequence transfer loop, protect it with the spinlock to prevent
  a race with the interrupt handler.

  Protect the curr_xfer clearing at the exit path of
  tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer() with the spinlock to prevent a race
  with the interrupt handler that reads this field.

  Without this protection, the IRQ handler could read a partially updated
  curr_xfer value, leading to NULL pointer dereference or use-after-free.
