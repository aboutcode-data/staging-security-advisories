aliases: []
summary: The Clasifico Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in
  versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to the plugin allowing users who are registering
  new accounts to set their own role by supplying the 'listing_user_role' parameter. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain elevated privileges by registering an account
  with the administrator role.
