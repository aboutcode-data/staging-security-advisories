aliases: []
summary: The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized Account Access and
  Privilege Escalation in versions up to, and including, 4.10.7 due to improper implementation
  of the Apple login feature. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user as
  long as they know the user's email address. We are disclosing this issue as the developer
  has not yet released a patch, but continues to release updates and we escalated this issue
  to the plugin's team 30 days ago.
