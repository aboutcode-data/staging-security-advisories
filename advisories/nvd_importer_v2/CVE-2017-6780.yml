aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process for Cisco IoT Field Network Director
  (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the system to consume additional
  memory, eventually forcing the device to restart, aka Memory Exhaustion. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient rate-limiting protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a high rate of TCP packets to a specific group of open listening ports on a targeted
  device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to consume additional memory.
  If enough available memory is consumed, the system will restart, creating a temporary denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The DoS condition will end after the device has finished the restart
  process. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products: Connected Grid Network Management
  System, if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.0; IoT Field Network Director,
  if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc77164.'
