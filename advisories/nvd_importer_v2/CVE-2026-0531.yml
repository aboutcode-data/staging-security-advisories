aliases: []
summary: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770) in Kibana Fleet can
  lead to Excessive Allocation (CAPEC-130) via a specially crafted bulk retrieval request. This
  requires an attacker to have low-level privileges equivalent to the viewer role, which grants
  read access to agent policies. The crafted request can cause the application to perform redundant
  database retrieval operations that immediately consume memory until the server crashes and
  becomes unavailable to all users.
