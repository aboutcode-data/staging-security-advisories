summary: The Automatic Translator with Google Translate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the custom font setting in all versions up to, and including,
  1.5.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
