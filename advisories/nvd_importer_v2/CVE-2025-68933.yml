aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 3.5.4, 2025.11.2,
  2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0, non-admin moderators with the `moderators_change_post_ownership`
  setting enabled can change ownership of posts in private messages and restricted categories
  they cannot access, then export their data to view the content. This is a broken access control
  vulnerability affecting sites that grant moderators post ownership transfer permissions. This
  issue is patched in versions 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0. The patch adds visibility
  checks for both the topic and posts before allowing ownership transfer. As a workaround, disable
  the `moderators_change_post_ownership` site setting to prevent non-admin moderators from using
  the post ownership transfer feature.
