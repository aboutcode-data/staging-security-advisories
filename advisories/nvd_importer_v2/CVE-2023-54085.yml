  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: fix NULL pointer dereference on fastopen early fallback

  In case of early fallback to TCP, subflow_syn_recv_sock() deletes
  the subflow context before returning the newly allocated sock to
  the caller.

  The fastopen path does not cope with the above unconditionally
  dereferencing the subflow context.
