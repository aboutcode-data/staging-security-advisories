aliases: []
summary: Agenta is an open-source LLMOps platform. A Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability
  exists in versions prior to 0.86.8 in Agenta's API server evaluator template rendering. Although
  the vulnerable code lives in the SDK package, it is executed server-side within the API process
  when running evaluators. This does not affect standalone SDK usage — it only impacts self-hosted
  or managed Agenta platform deployments. Version 0.86.8 contains a fix for the issue.
