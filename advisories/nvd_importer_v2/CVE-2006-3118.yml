aliases: []
summary: 'spread uses a temporary file with a static filename based on the port number, which
  allows local users to cause a denial of service by creating the file during a race condition
  between unlink and bind function calls.  NOTE: spread deletes this temporary file before use,
  which could cause conflicts with other programs that use the same filename, but this is not
  a distinct issue.'
