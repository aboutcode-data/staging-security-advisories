summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs/writeback: skip AS_NO_DATA_INTEGRITY mappings in wait_sb_inodes()

  Above the while() loop in wait_sb_inodes(), we document that we must wait
  for all pages under writeback for data integrity.  Consequently, if a
  mapping, like fuse, traditionally does not have data integrity semantics,
  there is no need to wait at all; we can simply skip these inodes.

  This restores fuse back to prior behavior where syncs are no-ops.  This
  fixes a user regression where if a system is running a faulty fuse server
  that does not reply to issued write requests, this causes wait_sb_inodes()
  to wait forever.
