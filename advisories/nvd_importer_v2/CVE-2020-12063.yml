summary: 'A certain Postfix 2.10.1-7 package could allow an attacker to send an email from an
  arbitrary-looking sender via a homoglyph attack, as demonstrated by the similarity of \xce\xbf
  to the ''o'' character. This is potentially relevant when the /etc/postfix/sender_login feature
  is used, because a spoofed outbound message that uses a configured sender address is blocked
  with a "Sender address rejected: not logged in" error message, but a spoofed outbound message
  that uses a homoglyph of a configured sender address is not blocked. NOTE: some third parties
  argue that any missed blocking of spoofed outbound messages - except for exact matches to
  a sender address in the /etc/postfix/sender_login file - is outside the design goals of Postfix
  and thus cannot be considered a Postfix vulnerability'
