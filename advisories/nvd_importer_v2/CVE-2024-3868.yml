summary: The Folders Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  a user's First Name and Last Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
