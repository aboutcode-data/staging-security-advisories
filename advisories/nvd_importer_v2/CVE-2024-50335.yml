aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
  software application. The "Publish Key" field in SuiteCRM's Edit Profile page is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript
  code. This can be exploited to steal CSRF tokens and perform unauthorized actions, such as
  creating new administrative users without proper authentication. The vulnerability arises
  due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the Publish Key field within the
  SuiteCRM application. When an attacker injects a malicious script, it gets executed within
  the context of an authenticated user's session. The injected script (o.js) then leverages
  the captured CSRF token to forge requests that create new administrative users, effectively
  compromising the integrity and security of the CRM instance. This issue has been addressed
  in versions 7.14.6 and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
