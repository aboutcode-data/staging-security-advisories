aliases: []
summary: '@octokit/request sends parameterized requests to GitHub’s APIs with sensible defaults
  in browsers and Node. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 9.2.1 and 8.4.1, the
  regular expression `/<([^>]+)>; rel="deprecation"/` used to match the `link` header in HTTP
  responses is vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack. This vulnerability
  arises due to the unbounded nature of the regex''s matching behavior, which can lead to catastrophic
  backtracking when processing specially crafted input. An attacker could exploit this flaw
  by sending a malicious `link` header, resulting in excessive CPU usage and potentially causing
  the server to become unresponsive, impacting service availability. Versions 9.2.1 and 8.4.1
  fix the issue.'
