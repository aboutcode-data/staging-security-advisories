  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpu: host1x: Fix race in syncpt alloc/free

  Fix race condition between host1x_syncpt_alloc()
  and host1x_syncpt_put() by using kref_put_mutex()
  instead of kref_put() + manual mutex locking.

  This ensures no thread can acquire the
  syncpt_mutex after the refcount drops to zero
  but before syncpt_release acquires it.
  This prevents races where syncpoints could
  be allocated while still being cleaned up
  from a previous release.

  Remove explicit mutex locking in syncpt_release
  as kref_put_mutex() handles this atomically.
