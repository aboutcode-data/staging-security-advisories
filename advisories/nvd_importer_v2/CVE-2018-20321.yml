aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Rancher 2 through 2.1.5. Any project member with access
  to the default namespace can mount the netes-default service account in a pod, and then use
  that pod to execute administrative privileged commands against the k8s cluster. This could
  be mitigated by isolating the default namespace in a separate project, where only cluster
  admins can be given permissions to access. As of 2018-12-20, this bug affected ALL clusters
  created or imported by Rancher.
