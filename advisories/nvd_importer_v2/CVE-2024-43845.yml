  udf: Fix bogus checksum computation in udf_rename()

  Syzbot reports uninitialized memory access in udf_rename() when updating
  checksum of '..' directory entry of a moved directory. This is indeed
  true as we pass on-stack diriter.fi to the udf_update_tag() and because
  that has only struct fileIdentDesc included in it and not the impUse or
  name fields, the checksumming function is going to checksum random stack
  contents beyond the end of the structure. This is actually harmless
  because the following udf_fiiter_write_fi() will recompute the checksum
  from on-disk buffers where everything is properly included. So all that
  is needed is just removing the bogus calculation.
