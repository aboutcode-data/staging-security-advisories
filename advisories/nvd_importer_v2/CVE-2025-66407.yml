summary: Weblate is a web based localization tool. The Create Component functionality in Weblate
  allows authorized users to add new translation components by specifying both a version control
  system and a source code repository URL to pull from. However, prior to version 5.15, the
  repository URL field is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary
  protocols, hostnames, and IP addresses, including localhost, internal network addresses, and
  local filenames. When the Mercurial version control system is selected, Weblate exposes the
  full server-side HTTP response for the provided URL. This effectively creates a server-side
  request forgery (SSRF) primitive that can probe internal services and return their contents.
  In addition to accessing internal HTTP endpoints, the behavior also enables local file enumeration
  by attempting file:// requests. While file contents may not always be returned, the application’s
  error messages clearly differentiate between files that exist and files that do not, revealing
  information about the server’s filesystem layout. In cloud environments, this behavior is
  particularly dangerous, as internal-only endpoints such as cloud metadata services may be
  accessible, potentially leading to credential disclosure and full environment compromise.
  This has been addressed in the Weblate 5.15 release. As a workaround, remove Mercurial from
  `VCS_BACKENDS`; the Git backend is not affected. The Git backend was already configured to
  block the file protocol and does not expose the HTTP response content in the error message.
