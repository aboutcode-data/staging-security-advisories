summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Customer Voice
  Portal (CVP) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of
  a parameter that is used by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit
