aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup and OpsCenter through 8.3.0.1. NetBackup
  processes using Strawberry Perl attempt to load and execute libraries from paths that do not
  exist by default on the Windows operating system. By default, on Windows systems, users can
  create directories under C:\. If a low privileged user on the Windows system creates an affected
  path with a library that NetBackup attempts to load, they can execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM
  or Administrator. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the
  attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc. This affects
  NetBackup master servers, media servers, clients, and OpsCenter servers on the Windows platform.
  The system is vulnerable during an install or upgrade on all systems and post-install on Master,
  Media, and OpsCenter servers during normal operations.
