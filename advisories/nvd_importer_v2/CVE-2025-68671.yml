aliases: []
summary: lakeFS is an open-source tool that transforms object storage into a Git-like repositories.
  LakeFS's S3 gateway does not validate timestamps in authenticated requests, allowing replay
  attacks. Prior to 1.75.0, an attacker who captures a valid signed request (e.g., through network
  interception, logs, or compromised systems) can replay that request until credentials are
  rotated, even after the request is intended to expire. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.75.0.
