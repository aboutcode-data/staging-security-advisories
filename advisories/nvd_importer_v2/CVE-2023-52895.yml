  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/poll: don't reissue in case of poll race on multishot request

  A previous commit fixed a poll race that can occur, but it's only
  applicable for multishot requests. For a multishot request, we can safely
  ignore a spurious wakeup, as we never leave the waitqueue to begin with.

  A blunt reissue of a multishot armed request can cause us to leak a
  buffer, if they are ring provided. While this seems like a bug in itself,
  it's not really defined behavior to reissue a multishot request directly.
  It's less efficient to do so as well, and not required to rearm anything
  like it is for singleshot poll requests.
