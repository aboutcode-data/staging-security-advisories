aliases: []
summary: This affects all versions of package react-adal. It is possible for a specially crafted
  JWT token and request URL can cause the nonce, session and refresh values to be incorrectly
  validated, causing the application to treat an attacker-generated JWT token as authentic.
  The logical defect is caused by how the nonce, session and refresh values are stored in the
  browser local storage or session storage. Each key is automatically appended by ||. When the
  received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser
  storage, separated by ||, with || always appended to the end of the list. Since || will always
  be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string ("") will always be in the
  list of the valid values. Therefore, if an empty session parameter is provided in the callback
  URL, and a specially-crafted JWT token contains an nonce value of "" (empty string), then
  adal.js will consider the JWT token as authentic.
