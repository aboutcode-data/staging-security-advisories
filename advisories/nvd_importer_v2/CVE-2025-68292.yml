summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/memfd: fix\
  \ information leak in hugetlb folios\n\nWhen allocating hugetlb folios for memfd, three initialization\
  \ steps are\nmissing:\n\n1. Folios are not zeroed, leading to kernel memory disclosure to\
  \ userspace\n2. Folios are not marked uptodate before adding to page cache\n3. hugetlb_fault_mutex\
  \ is not taken before hugetlb_add_to_page_cache()\n\nThe memfd allocation path bypasses the\
  \ normal page fault handler\n(hugetlb_no_page) which would handle all of these initialization\
  \ steps. \nThis is problematic especially for udmabuf use cases where folios are\npinned and\
  \ directly accessed by userspace via DMA.\n\nFix by matching the initialization pattern used\
  \ in hugetlb_no_page():\n- Zero the folio using folio_zero_user() which is optimized for huge\
  \ pages\n- Mark it uptodate with folio_mark_uptodate()\n- Take hugetlb_fault_mutex before\
  \ adding to page cache to prevent races\n\nThe folio_zero_user() change also fixes a potential\
  \ security issue where\nuninitialized kernel memory could be disclosed to userspace through\
  \ read()\nor mmap() operations on the memfd."
