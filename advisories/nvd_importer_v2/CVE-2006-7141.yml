summary: 'Absolute path traversal vulnerability in Oracle Database Server, when utl_file_dir
  is set to a wildcard value or "CREATE ANY DIRECTORY to PUBLIC" privileges exist, allows remote
  authenticated users to read and modify arbitrary files via full filepaths to utl_file functions
  such as (1) utl_file.put_line and (2) utl_file.get_line, a related issue to CVE-2005-0701.  NOTE:
  this issue is disputed by third parties who state that this is due to an insecure configuration
