summary: StarWind SAN and NAS v0.2 build 1914 allow remote code execution. A flaw was found
  in REST API in StarWind Stack. REST command, which allows changing the hostname, doesn’t check
  a new hostname parameter. It goes directly to bash as part of a script. An attacker with non-root
  user access can inject arbitrary data into the command that will be executed with root privileges.
