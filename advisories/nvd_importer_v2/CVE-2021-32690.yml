aliases: []
summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources).
  In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password
  credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced
  by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through
  which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password
  for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain
  being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository,
  one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another
  domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed
  on.
