summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: Intel: avs: Disable periods-elapsed work when closing PCM

  avs_dai_fe_shutdown() handles the shutdown procedure for HOST HDAudio
  stream while period-elapsed work services its IRQs. As the former
  frees the DAI's private context, these two operations shall be
  synchronized to avoid slab-use-after-free or worse errors.
