aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the Hugging
  Face Transformers library, specifically in the `convert_tf_weight_name_to_pt_weight_name()`
  function. This function, responsible for converting TensorFlow weight names to PyTorch format,
  uses a regex pattern `/[^/]*___([^/]*)/` that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption
  through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. The vulnerability affects
  versions up to 4.51.3 and is fixed in version 4.53.0. This issue can lead to service disruption,
  resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting model conversion
  processes between TensorFlow and PyTorch formats.
