aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Messaging
  Server Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information
  or cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. This vulnerability
  is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML
  files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains
  references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve
  files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause
  the application to consume available resources, resulting in a partial DoS condition on an
  affected system. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
