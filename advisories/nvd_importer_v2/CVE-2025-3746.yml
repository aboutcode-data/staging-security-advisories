aliases: []
summary: "The OTP-less one tap Sign in plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation\
  \ via account takeover in versions 2.0.14 to 2.0.59. This is due to the plugin not properly\
  \ validating a user's identity prior to updating their details, like email. This makes it\
  \ possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary users' email addresses, including\
  \ administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their\
  \ account.\r\nAdditionally, the plugin returns authentication cookies in the response, which\
  \ can be used to access the account directly."
