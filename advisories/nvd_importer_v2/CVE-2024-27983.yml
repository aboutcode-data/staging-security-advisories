aliases: []
summary: An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server completely unavailable by sending a
  small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames inside. It is possible to leave
  some data in nghttp2 memory after reset when headers with HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame are sent
  to the server and then a TCP connection is abruptly closed by the client triggering the Http2Session
  destructor while header frames are still being processed (and stored in memory) causing a
  race condition.
