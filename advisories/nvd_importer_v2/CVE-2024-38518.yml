summary: BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and
  learners learn. An attacker with a valid join link to a meeting can trick BigBlueButton into

  allowing an attacker to join a meeting as moderator using a join link that was originally
  created for viewer access. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 2.6.18, 2.7.8
