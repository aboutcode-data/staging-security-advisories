aliases: []
summary: The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password and email through
  the edit_profile_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  change arbitrary user's email addresses and passwords, including administrators, and leverage
  that to gain access to their account.
