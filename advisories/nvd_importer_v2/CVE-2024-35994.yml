  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix memory related IO errors and crashes

  It turns out that while the QSEECOM APP_SEND command has specific fields
  for request and response buffers, uefisecapp expects them both to be in
  a single memory region. Failure to adhere to this has (so far) resulted
  in either no response being written to the response buffer (causing an
  EIO to be emitted down the line), the SCM call to fail with EINVAL
  (i.e., directly from TZ/firmware), or the device to be hard-reset.

  While this issue can be triggered deterministically, in the current form
  it seems to happen rather sporadically (which is why it has gone
  unnoticed during earlier testing). This is likely due to the two
  kzalloc() calls (for request and response) being directly after each
  other. Which means that those likely return consecutive regions most of
  the time, especially when not much else is going on in the system.

  Fix this by allocating a single memory region for both request and
  response buffers, properly aligning both structs inside it. This
  unfortunately also means that the qcom_scm_qseecom_app_send() interface
  needs to be restructured, as it should no longer map the DMA regions
  separately. Therefore, move the responsibility of DMA allocation (or
  mapping) to the caller.
