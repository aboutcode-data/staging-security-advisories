aliases: []
summary: Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl, a free, open-source game server
  management panel. Prior to version 1.12.1, a missing authorization check in multiple controllers
  allows any user with access to a node secret token to fetch information about any server on
  a Pterodactyl instance, even if that server is associated with a different node. This issue
  stems from missing logic to verify that the node requesting server data is the same node that
  the server is associated with. Any authenticated Wings node can retrieve server installation
  scripts (potentially containing secret values) and manipulate the installation status of servers
  belonging to other nodes. Wings nodes may also manipulate the transfer status of servers belonging
  to other nodes. This vulnerability requires a user to acquire a secret access token for a
  node. Unless a user gains access to a Wings secret access token they would not be able to
  access any of these vulnerable endpoints, as every endpoint requires a valid node access token.
  A single compromised Wings node daemon token (stored in plaintext at `/etc/pterodactyl/config.yml`)
  grants access to sensitive configuration data of every server on the panel, rather than only
  to servers that the node has access to. An attacker can use this information to move laterally
  through the system, send excessive notifications, destroy server data on other nodes, and
  otherwise exfiltrate secrets that they should not have access to with only a node token. Additionally,
  triggering a false transfer success causes the panel to delete the server from the source
  node, resulting in permanent data loss. Users should upgrade to version 1.12.1 to receive
  a fix.
