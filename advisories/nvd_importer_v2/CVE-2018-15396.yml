aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Bulk Administration Tool (BAT) for Cisco Unity Connection could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause high disk utilization, resulting in a denial
  of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not
  restrict the maximum size of certain files that can be written to disk. An attacker who has
  valid administrator credentials for an affected system could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a crafted, remote connection request to an affected system. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to write a file that consumes most of the available disk space on the system,
  causing application functions to operate abnormally and leading to a DoS condition.
