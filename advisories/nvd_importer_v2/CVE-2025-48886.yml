aliases: []
summary: Hydra is a layer-two scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to version 0.22.0, the
  process assumes L1 event finality and does not consider failed transactions. Currently, Cardano
  L1 is monitored for certain events which are necessary for state progression. At the moment,
  Hydra considers those events as finalized as soon as they are recognized by the node participants
  making such transactions the target of re-org attacks. The system does not currently consider
  the fact that failed transactions on the Cardano L1 can indeed appear in blocks because these
  transactions are so infrequent. This issue has been patched in version 0.22.0.
