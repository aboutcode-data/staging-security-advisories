  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  octeontx2-pf: Fix potential use after free in otx2_tc_add_flow()

  This code calls kfree_rcu(new_node, rcu) and then dereferences "new_node"
  and then dereferences it on the next line.  Two lines later, we take
  a mutex so I don't think this is an RCU safe region.  Re-order it to do
  the dereferences before queuing up the free.
