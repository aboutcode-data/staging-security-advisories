summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64/pageattr: Propagate return value from __change_memory_common

  The rodata=on security measure requires that any code path which does
  vmalloc -> set_memory_ro/set_memory_rox must protect the linear map alias
  too. Therefore, if such a call fails, we must abort set_memory_* and caller
  must take appropriate action; currently we are suppressing the error, and
  there is a real chance of such an error arising post commit a166563e7ec3
  ("arm64: mm: support large block mapping when rodata=full"). Therefore,
  propagate any error to the caller.
