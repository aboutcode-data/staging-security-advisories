summary: The Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers flaw (CVE-2016-2183) was reported
  for the health checks port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy component. Even though the CVE-2016-2183
  has been fixed in the etcd components, to enable periodic health checks from kubelet, it was
  necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy, hence this port might be considered
  as still vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy
  do not contain sensitive data (only metrics data), therefore the potential impact related
  to this vulnerability is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been assigned to this issue to track
  the permanent fix in the etcd component.
