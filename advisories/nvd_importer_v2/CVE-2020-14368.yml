aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Eclipse Che in versions prior to 7.14.0 that impacts CodeReady
  Workspaces. When configured with cookies authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set the
  SameSite value, allowing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and consequently allowing a cross-site
  WebSocket hijack on Theia IDE. This flaw allows an attacker to gain full access to the victim's
  workspace through the /services endpoint. To perform a successful attack, the attacker conducts
  a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) and tricks the victim into executing a request via an untrusted
  link, which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack. The highest threat from this vulnerability
  is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
