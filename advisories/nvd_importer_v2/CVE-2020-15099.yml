aliases: []
summary: In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and greater than
  or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, in a case where an attacker manages to generate a
  valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) - either by using a different
  existing vulnerability or in case the internal encryptionKey was exposed - it is possible
  to retrieve arbitrary files of a TYPO3 installation. This includes the possibility to fetch
  typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, which again contains the encryptionKey as well as credentials
  of the database management system being used. In case a database server is directly accessible
  either via internet or in a shared hosting network, this allows the ability to completely
  retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includes creating an administration
  user account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by injecting custom extensions.
  This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.
