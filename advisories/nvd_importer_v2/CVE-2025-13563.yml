aliases: []
summary: The Lizza LMS Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the 'lizza_lms_pro_register_user_front_end'
  function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain
  administrator access to the site.
