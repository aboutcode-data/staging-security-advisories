  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: tls: avoid hanging tasks on the tx_lock

  syzbot sent a hung task report and Eric explains that adversarial
  receiver may keep RWIN at 0 for a long time, so we are not guaranteed
  to make forward progress. Thread which took tx_lock and went to sleep
  may not release tx_lock for hours. Use interruptible sleep where
  possible and reschedule the work if it can't take the lock.

  Testing: existing selftest passes
