aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the binding configuration of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software containers
  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker who has access to the VPN0 logical network
  to also access the messaging service ports on an affected system. This vulnerability exists
  because the messaging server container ports on an affected system lack sufficient protection
  mechanisms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the messaging service
  ports of the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to
  send network traffic to interfaces within the VPN0 logical network. This network may be restricted
  to protect logical or physical adjacent networks, depending on device deployment configuration.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and inject messages into the messaging
  service, which can cause configuration changes or cause the system to reload.
