aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1, a vulnerability exists where a user removed from
  an organization can still read, create, modify, and delete logs by re-using an old authorization
  token. The lunary web application communicates with the server using an 'Authorization' token
  in the browser, which does not properly invalidate upon the user's removal from the organization.
  This allows the removed user to perform unauthorized actions on logs and access project and
  external user details without valid permissions.
