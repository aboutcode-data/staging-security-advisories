summary: Apollo Router Core is a configurable graph router written in Rust to run a federated
  supergraph using Apollo Federation 2. In versions 1.61.11 below, as well as 2.0.0-alpha.0
  through 2.8.1-rc.0, a vulnerability allowed for unauthenticated queries to access data that
  required additional access controls. Router incorrectly handled access control directives
  on interface types/fields and their implementing object types/fields, applying them to interface
  types/fields while ignoring directives on their implementing object types/fields when all
  implementations had the same requirements. Apollo Router customers defining @authenticated,
  @requiresScopes, or @policy directives inconsistently on polymorphic types (i.e., object types
  that implement interface types) are impacted. This issue is fixed in versions 1.61.12 and
  2.8.1.
