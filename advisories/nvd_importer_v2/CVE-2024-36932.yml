aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal

  Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can
  run in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free
  the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been
  checked against NULL.

  If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory
  that has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.

  Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around
  the cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the
  same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.
