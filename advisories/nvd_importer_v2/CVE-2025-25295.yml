aliases: []
summary: Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. A path traversal vulnerability in
  Label Studio SDK versions prior to 1.0.10 allows unauthorized file access outside the intended
  directory structure. The flaw exists in the VOC, COCO and YOLO export functionalities. These
  functions invoke a `download` function on the `label-studio-sdk` python package, which fails
  to validate file paths when processing image references during task exports. By creating tasks
  with path traversal sequences in the image field, an attacker can force the application to
  read files from arbitrary server filesystem locations when exporting projects in any of the
  mentioned formats. This is authentication-required vulnerability allowing arbitrary file reads
  from the server filesystem. It may lead to potential exposure of sensitive information like
  configuration files, credentials, and confidential data. Label Studio versions before 1.16.0
  specified SDK versions prior to 1.0.10 as dependencies, and the issue was confirmed in Label
  Studio version 1.13.2.dev0; therefore, Label Studio users should upgrade to 1.16.0 or newer
  to mitigate it.
