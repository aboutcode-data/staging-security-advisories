  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpu: host1x: Fix memory leak of device names

  The device names allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed
  before module unloading, but they can not be freed because
  the kobject's refcount which was set in device_initialize()
  has not be decreased to 0.

  As comment of device_add() says, if it fails, use only
  put_device() drop the refcount, then the name will be
  freed in kobejct_cleanup().

  device_del() and put_device() can be replaced with
  device_unregister(), so call it to unregister the added
  successfully devices, and just call put_device() to the
  not added device.

  Add a release() function to device to avoid null release()
  function WARNING in device_release(), it's empty, because
  the context devices are freed together in
  host1x_memory_context_list_free().
