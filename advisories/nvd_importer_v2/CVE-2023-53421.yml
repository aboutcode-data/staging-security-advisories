summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  blk-cgroup: Reinit blkg_iostat_set after clearing in blkcg_reset_stats()

  When blkg_alloc() is called to allocate a blkcg_gq structure
  with the associated blkg_iostat_set's, there are 2 fields within
  blkg_iostat_set that requires proper initialization - blkg & sync.
  The former field was introduced by commit 3b8cc6298724 ("blk-cgroup:
  Optimize blkcg_rstat_flush()") while the later one was introduced by
  commit f73316482977 ("blk-cgroup: reimplement basic IO stats using
  cgroup rstat").

  Unfortunately those fields in the blkg_iostat_set's are not properly
  re-initialized when they are cleared in v1's blkcg_reset_stats(). This
  can lead to a kernel panic due to NULL pointer access of the blkg
  pointer. The missing initialization of sync is less problematic and
  can be a problem in a debug kernel due to missing lockdep initialization.

  Fix these problems by re-initializing them after memory clearing.
