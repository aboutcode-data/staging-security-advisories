aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Keycloak's SAML brokering functionality. When Keycloak is configured
  as a client in a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) setup, it fails to validate the
  `NotOnOrAfter` timestamp within the `SubjectConfirmationData`. This allows an attacker to
  delay the expiration of SAML responses, potentially extending the time a response is considered
  valid and leading to unexpected session durations or resource consumption.
