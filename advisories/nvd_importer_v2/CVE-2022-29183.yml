aliases: []
summary: GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions 20.2.0 until 21.4.0 are vulnerable
  to reflected cross-site scripting via abuse of the pipeline comparison function's error handling
  to render arbitrary HTML into the returned page. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim
  into executing code which would allow the attacker to operate on, or gain control over the
  same resources as the victim had access to. This issue is fixed in GoCD 21.4.0. As a workaround,
  block access to `/go/compare/.*` prior to GoCD Server via a reverse proxy, web application
  firewall or equivalent, which would prevent use of the pipeline comparison function.
