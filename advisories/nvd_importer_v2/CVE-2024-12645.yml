aliases: []
summary: The topm-client from Chunghwa Telecom has an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability. The
  application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the
  target website. Due to the lack of CSRF protection for the APIs, unauthenticated remote attackers
  could use these APIs through phishing. Additionally, one of the APIs contains a Relative Path
  Traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files on the user's system.
