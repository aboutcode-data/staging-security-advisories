summary: The Multi Item Responsive Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
