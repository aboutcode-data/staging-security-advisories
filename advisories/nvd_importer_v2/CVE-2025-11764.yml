summary: The Shortcodes Bootstrap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'type' parameter in the [notification] shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  1.1. This is due to missing input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
