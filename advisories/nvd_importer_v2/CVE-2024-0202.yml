aliases: []
summary: A security vulnerability has been identified in the cryptlib cryptographic library
  when cryptlib is compiled with the support for RSA key exchange ciphersuites in TLS (by setting
  the USE_RSA_SUITES define), it will be vulnerable to the timing variant of the Bleichenbacher
  attack. An attacker that is able to perform a large number of connections to the server will
  be able to decrypt RSA ciphertexts or forge signatures using server's certificate.
