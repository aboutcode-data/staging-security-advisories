aliases: []
summary: 'Untrusted search path vulnerability in the TrueVector service (VSMON.exe) in Zone
  Labs ZoneAlarm 6.x and Integrity does not search ZoneAlarm''s own folders before other folders
  that are specified in a user''s PATH, which might allow local users to execute code as SYSTEM
  by placing malicious DLLs into a folder that has insecure permissions, but is searched before
  ZoneAlarm''s folder.  NOTE: since this issue is dependent on the existence of a vulnerability
  in a separate product (weak permissions of executables or libraries, or the execution of malicious
  code), perhaps it should not be included in CVE.'
