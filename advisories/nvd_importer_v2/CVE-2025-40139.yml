summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in in smc_clc_prfx_set().

  smc_clc_prfx_set() is called during connect() and not under RCU
  nor RTNL.

  Using sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.

  Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dev_dst_rcu() under rcu_read_lock()
  after kernel_getsockname().

  Note that the returned value of smc_clc_prfx_set() is not used
  in the caller.

  While at it, we change the 1st arg of smc_clc_prfx_set[46]_rcu()
  not to touch dst there.
