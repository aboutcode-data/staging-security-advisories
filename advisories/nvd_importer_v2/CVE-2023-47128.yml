aliases: []
summary: 'Piccolo is an object-relational mapping and query builder which supports asyncio.
  Prior to version 1.1.1, the handling of named transaction `savepoints` in all database implementations
  is vulnerable to SQL Injection via f-strings. While the likelihood of an end developer exposing
  a `savepoints` `name` parameter to a user is highly unlikely, it would not be unheard of.
  If a malicious user was able to abuse this functionality they would have essentially direct
  access to the database and the ability to modify data to the level of permissions associated
  with the database user. A non exhaustive list of actions possible based on database permissions
  is: Read all data stored in the database, including usernames and password hashes; insert
  arbitrary data into the database, including modifying existing records; and gain a shell on
  the underlying server. Version 1.1.1 fixes this issue.'
