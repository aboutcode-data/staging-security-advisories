aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvme-tcp: don't access released socket during error recovery

  While the error recovery work is temporarily failing reconnect attempts,
  running the 'nvme list' command causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference
  by calling getsockname() with a released socket.

  During error recovery work, the nvme tcp socket is released and a new one
  created, so it is not safe to access the socket without proper check.
