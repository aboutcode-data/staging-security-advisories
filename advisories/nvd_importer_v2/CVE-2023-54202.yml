summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/i915: fix race condition UAF in i915_perf_add_config_ioctl

  Userspace can guess the id value and try to race oa_config object creation
  with config remove, resulting in a use-after-free if we dereference the
  object after unlocking the metrics_lock.  For that reason, unlocking the
  metrics_lock must be done after we are done dereferencing the object.

  [tursulin: Manually added stable tag.]
  (cherry picked from commit 49f6f6483b652108bcb73accd0204a464b922395)
