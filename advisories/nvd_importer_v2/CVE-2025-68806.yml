  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ksmbd: fix buffer validation by including null terminator size in EA length

  The smb2_set_ea function, which handles Extended Attributes (EA),
  was performing buffer validation checks that incorrectly omitted the size
  of the null terminating character (+1 byte) for EA Name.
  This patch fixes the issue by explicitly adding '+ 1' to EaNameLength where
  the null terminator is expected to be present in the buffer, ensuring
  the validation accurately reflects the total required buffer size.
