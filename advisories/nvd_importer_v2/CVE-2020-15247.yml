aliases: []
summary: October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework.
  In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, an authenticated backend user
  with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would
  normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode
  being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary
  PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally
  write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a
  problem for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions
  in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched
  in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.
