  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug

  The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()
  in switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop
  the worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,
  a use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:

        (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)
  switch_drv_remove()              |
   flush_work()                    |
    ...                            |  switch_timer // timer
                                   |   schedule_work(&psw->work)
   timer_shutdown_sync()           |
   ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker
   kfree(psw) // free              |
                                   |   psw->state = 0 // use

  This patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to
  mitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be
  stopped safely before the deallocate operations.
