aliases: []
summary: Woocommerce is an open source eCommerce plugin for WordPress. An SQL injection vulnerability
  impacts all WooCommerce sites running the WooCommerce plugin between version 3.3.0 and 3.3.6.
  Malicious actors (already) having admin access, or API keys to the WooCommerce site can exploit
  vulnerable endpoints of `/wp-json/wc/v3/webhooks`, `/wp-json/wc/v2/webhooks` and other webhook
  listing API. Read-only SQL queries can be executed using this exploit, while data will not
  be returned, by carefully crafting `search` parameter information can be disclosed using timing
  and related attacks. Version 3.3.6 is the earliest version of Woocommerce with a patch for
  this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds other than upgrading.
