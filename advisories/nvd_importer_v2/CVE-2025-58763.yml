aliases: []
summary: Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. A command
  injection vulnerability in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior allows attackers with administrative
  privileges to obtain remote code execution on the application server. This vulnerability requires
  the application to have been cloned from GitHub and installed manually. When Tautulli is cloned
  directly from GitHub and installed manually, the application manages updates and versioning
  through calls to the `git` command. In the code, this is performed through the `runGit` function
  in `versioncheck.py`. Since `shell=True` is passed to `subproces.Popen`, this call is vulnerable
  to subject to command injection, as shell characters within arguments will be passed to the
  underlying shell. A concrete location where this can be triggered is in the `checkout_git_branch`
  endpoint. This endpoint stores a user-supplied remote and branch name into the `GIT_REMOTE`
  and `GIT_BRANCH` configuration keys without sanitization. Downstream, these keys are then
  fetched and passed directly into `runGit` using a format string. Hence, code execution can
  be obtained by using `$()` interpolation in a command. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the
  issue.
