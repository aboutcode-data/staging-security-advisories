summary: "A vulnerability in the uninstaller component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\
  \ for Mac OS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to corrupt the content of any file\
  \ in the filesystem.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of directory paths.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to a\
  \ target file on a specific path. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt\
  \ the contents of the file. If the file is a critical systems file, the exploit could lead\
  \ to a denial of service condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need\
  \ to have valid credentials on the system.Cisco has released software updates that address\
  \ this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
