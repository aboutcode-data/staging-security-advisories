  scsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts

  Hyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host
  system and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC
  device is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a
  partial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic
  portion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed
  in /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC
  don't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't
  practical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.

  In particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout
  function fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the
  rport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the
  call from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this
  regard.

  In many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation
  can be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests
  issued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent
  failure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic,
  which again may be better.

  So fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This
  allows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested
  by users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient
  timeouts, and it solves their problem.

  In the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc
  since it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is
  working well enough, so it should probably stay for a while longer.
