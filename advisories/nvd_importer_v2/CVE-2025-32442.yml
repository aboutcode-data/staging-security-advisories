aliases: []
summary: Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. In versions 5.0.0 to
  5.3.0 as well as version 4.29.0, applications that specify different validation strategies
  for different content types have a possibility to bypass validation by providing a _slightly
  altered_ content type such as with different casing or altered whitespacing before `;`. This
  was patched in v5.3.1, but the initial patch did not cover all problems. This has been fully
  patched in v5.3.2 and v4.29.1. A workaround involves not specifying individual content types
  in the schema.
