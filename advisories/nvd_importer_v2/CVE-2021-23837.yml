summary: An issue was discovered in flatCore before 2.0.0 build 139. A time-based blind SQL
  injection was identified in the selected_folder HTTP request body parameter for the acp interface.
  The affected parameter (which retrieves the file contents of the specified folder) was found
  to be accepting malicious user input without proper sanitization, thus leading to SQL injection.
