summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC)
  3.0(1c) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an
  affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently
  sanitize user-supplied HTTP input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  an HTTP POST request that contains crafted, deserialized user data to the affected software.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root-level
  privileges on the affected system, which the attacker could use to conduct further attacks.
