aliases: []
summary: Due to a Deserialization vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver (JMS service), an attacker
  authenticated as an administrator with local access could submit specially crafted content
  to the server. If processed by the application, this content could trigger unintended behavior
  during internal logic execution, potentially causing a denial of service. Successful exploitation
  results in a high impact on availability, while confidentiality and integrity remain unaffected.
