aliases: []
summary: Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. The
  `real_pms_image_proxy` endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior is vulnerable to path traversal,
  allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem.
  The `real_pms_image_proxy` is used to fetch an image directly from the backing Plex Media
  Server. The image to be fetched is specified through an `img` URL parameter, which can either
  be a URL or a file path. There is some validation ensuring that `img` begins with the prefix
  `interfaces/default/images` in order to be served from the local filesystem. However this
  can be bypassed by passing an `img` parameter which begins with a valid prefix, and then adjoining
  path traversal characters in order to reach files outside of intended directories. An attacker
  can exfiltrate files on the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database
  containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin
  password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If
  the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated
  attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application.
  Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue.
