aliases: []
summary: vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). From versions
  0.10.2 to before 0.11.1, a memory corruption vulnerability could lead to a crash (denial-of-service)
  and potentially remote code execution (RCE), exists in the Completions API endpoint. When
  processing user-supplied prompt embeddings, the endpoint loads serialized tensors using torch.load()
  without sufficient validation. Due to a change introduced in PyTorch 2.8.0, sparse tensor
  integrity checks are disabled by default. As a result, maliciously crafted tensors can bypass
  internal bounds checks and trigger an out-of-bounds memory write during the call to to_dense().
  This memory corruption can crash vLLM and potentially lead to code execution on the server
  hosting vLLM. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.1.
