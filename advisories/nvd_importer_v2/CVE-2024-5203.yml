summary: 'Rejected reason: After careful review of CVE-2024-5203, it has been determined that
  the issue is not exploitable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the exploit assumes that the
  attacker has access to a session code parameter that matches a cookie on the Keycloak server.
  However the attacker does not have access to the cookie, and can therefore not craft a malicious
  request.'
