aliases: []
summary: In “Dolibarr ERP CRM”, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored
  XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts
  in the “Private Note” field at “/adherents/note.php?id=1” endpoint. These scripts are executed
  in a victim’s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst
  case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator.
  The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of
  the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low
  privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.
