aliases: []
summary: Elasticsearch generally filters out sensitive information and credentials before logging
  to the audit log. It was found that this filtering was not applied when requests to Elasticsearch
  use certain deprecated URIs for APIs. The impact of this flaw is that sensitive information
  such as passwords and tokens might be printed in cleartext in Elasticsearch audit logs. Note
  that audit logging is disabled by default and needs to be explicitly enabled and even when
  audit logging is enabled, request bodies that could contain sensitive information are not
  printed to the audit log unless explicitly configured.
