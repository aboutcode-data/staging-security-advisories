summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation
  Fulfillment (HCM-F) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  CSRF protections by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  persuading a targeted user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to send arbitrary requests that could change the password of a targeted user. An
  attacker could then take unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user.
