  firewire: core: fix race condition against transaction list

  The list of transaction is enumerated without acquiring card lock when
  processing AR response event. This causes a race condition bug when
  processing AT request completion event concurrently.

  expiration into the scope of lock. The value of jiffies in card structure
  is referred before acquiring the lock.
