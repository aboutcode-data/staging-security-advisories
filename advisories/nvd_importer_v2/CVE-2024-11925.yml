aliases: []
summary: The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
  a users identity when verifying an email address through the user_account_activation function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including site
  administrators if the users email is known.
