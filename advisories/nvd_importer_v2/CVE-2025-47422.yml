summary: Advanced Installer before 22.6 has an uncontrolled search path element local privilege
  escalation vulnerability. When running as SYSTEM in certain configurations, Advanced Installer
  looks in standard-user writable locations for non-existent binaries and executes them as SYSTEM.

  is executed, the attacker achieves arbitrary SYSTEM code execution.
