aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenStack Nova before 30.2.2, 31 before 31.2.1, and 32 before
  32.1.1. By writing a malicious QCOW header to a root or ephemeral disk and then triggering
  a resize, a user may convince Nova's Flat image backend to call qemu-img without a format
  restriction, resulting in an unsafe image resize operation that could destroy data on the
  host system. Only compute nodes using the Flat image backend (usually configured with use_cow_images=False)
  are affected.
