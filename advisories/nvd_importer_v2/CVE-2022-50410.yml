  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  NFSD: Protect against send buffer overflow in NFSv2 READ

  Since before the git era, NFSD has conserved the number of pages
  held by each nfsd thread by combining the RPC receive and send
  buffers into a single array of pages. This works because there are
  no cases where an operation needs a large RPC Call message and a
  large RPC Reply at the same time.

  Once an RPC Call has been received, svc_process() updates
  svc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages that can be
  used for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer
  (rq_res) shrinks when the received RPC record containing the RPC
  Call is large.

  A client can force this shrinkage on TCP by sending a correctly-
  formed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is
  excessively large. The full maximum payload size cannot be
  constructed in that case.
