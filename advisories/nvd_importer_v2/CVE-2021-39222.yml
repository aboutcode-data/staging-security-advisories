aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Talk
  application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation,
  a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the
  strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern
  browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application
  is upgraded to patched versions 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0. As a workaround,
  use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.
