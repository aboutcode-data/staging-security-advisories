aliases: []
summary: TablePress is a table plugin for Wordpress. For importing tables, TablePress makes
  external HTTP requests based on a URL that is provided by the user. That user input is filtered
  insufficiently, which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network locations
  and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like AWS, an attacker can potentially
  make GET requests to the instance's metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is
  insecure, this can lead to the exposure of internal data, including credentials. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 2.2.5.
