aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions
  0.3.10 and prior, incorrect values can be logged when `raw_log` builtin is called with memory
  or storage arguments to be used as topics. A contract search was performed and no vulnerable
  contracts were found in production. The `build_IR` function of the `RawLog` class fails to
  properly unwrap the variables provided as topics. Consequently, incorrect values are logged
  as topics. As of time of publication, no fixed version is available.
