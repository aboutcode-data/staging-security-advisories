summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Prior to
  versions 4.5.5, 4.4.12, and 4.3.18, an insecure direct object reference in the web push subscription
  update endpoint lets any authenticated user update another user's push subscription by guessing
  or obtaining the numeric subscription id. This can be used to disrupt push notifications for
  other users and also leaks the web push subscription endpoint. Any user with a web push subscription
  is impacted, because another authenticated user can tamper with their push subscription settings
  if they can guess or obtain the subscription id. This allows an attacker to disrupt push notifications
  by changing the policy (whether to filter notifications from non-followers or non-followed
  users) and subscribed notification types of their victims. Additionally, the endpoint returns
  the subscription object, which includes the push notification endpoint for this subscription,
  but not its keypair. Mastodon versions v4.5.5, v4.4.12, v4.3.18 are patched.
