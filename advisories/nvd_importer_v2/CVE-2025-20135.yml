summary: "A vulnerability in the DHCP client functionality of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive\
  \ Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to exhaust available memory.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to improper validation of incoming DHCP packets. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly sending crafted DHCPv4 packets to an affected device.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available memory, which would affect\
  \ availability of services and prevent new processes from starting, resulting in a Denial\
  \ of Service (DoS) condition that would require a manual reboot.\r\nNote: On Cisco Secure\
  \ FTD Software, this vulnerability does not affect management interfaces."
