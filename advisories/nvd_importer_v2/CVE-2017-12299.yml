aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability exists in the process of creating default IP blocks during device
  initialization for Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall Services that could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to send traffic to the local IP address of the device, bypassing any filters
  that are configured to deny local IP management traffic. The vulnerability is due to an implementation
  error that exists in the process of creating default IP blocks when the device is initialized,
  and the way in which those IP blocks interact with user-configured filters for local IP management
  traffic (for example, SSH to the device). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending traffic to the local IP address of the targeted device. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to connect to the local IP address of the device even when there are filters
  configured to deny the traffic. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd97962.'
