summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ice: set tx_tstamps when creating new Tx rings via ethtool

  When the user changes the number of queues via ethtool, the driver
  allocates new rings. This allocation did not initialize tx_tstamps. This
  results in the tx_tstamps field being zero (due to kcalloc allocation), and
  would result in a NULL pointer dereference when attempting a transmit
  timestamp on the new ring.
