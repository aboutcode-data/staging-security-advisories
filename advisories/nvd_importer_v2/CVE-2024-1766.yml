aliases: []
summary: The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via a user's Display Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.86 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering
  to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring
  a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.
