aliases: []
summary: The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Profile Privacy Setting Bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.0. This is due to a flaw in the secure fields mechanism
  where field keys are stored in the allowed fields list before the `required_perm` check is
  applied during rendering. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level
  access to modify their profile privacy settings (e.g., setting profile to "Only me") via direct
  parameter manipulation, even when the administrator has explicitly disabled the option for
  their role.
