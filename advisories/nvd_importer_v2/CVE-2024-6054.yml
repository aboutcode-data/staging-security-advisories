aliases: []
summary: The Auto Featured Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'create_post_attachment_from_url' function in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  contributor-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
