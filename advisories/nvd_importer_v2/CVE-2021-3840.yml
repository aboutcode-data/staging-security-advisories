aliases: []
summary: A dependency confusion vulnerability was reported in the Antilles open-source software
  prior to version 1.0.1 that could allow for remote code execution during installation due
  to a package listed in requirements.txt not existing in the public package index (PyPi). MITRE
  classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private
  package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to
  a well-known public repository such as PyPi. The configuration has been updated to only install
  components built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the
  antilles-tools dependency has been published to PyPi.
