aliases: []
summary: TorrentPier is an open source BitTorrent Public/Private tracker engine, written in
  php. In versions up to and including 2.8.8, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists
  in the moderator control panel (`modcp.php`). Users with moderator permissions can exploit
  this vulnerability by supplying a malicious `topic_id` (`t`) parameter. This allows an authenticated
  moderator to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to the potential disclosure, modification,
  or deletion of any data in the database. Although it requires moderator privileges, it is
  still severe. A malicious or compromised moderator account can leverage this vulnerability
  to read, modify, or delete data. A patch is available at commit 6a0f6499d89fa5d6e2afa8ee53802a1ad11ece80.
