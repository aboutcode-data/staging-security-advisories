  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb-storage: alauda: Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()

  Syzbot got KMSAN to complain about access to an uninitialized value in
  the alauda subdriver of usb-storage:

  BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in alauda_transport+0x462/0x57f0
  drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:1137
  CPU: 0 PID: 12279 Comm: usb-storage Not tainted 5.3.0-rc7+ #0
  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS
  Google 01/01/2011
  Call Trace:
    __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:77 [inline]
    dump_stack+0x191/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:113
    kmsan_report+0x13a/0x2b0 mm/kmsan/kmsan_report.c:108
    __msan_warning+0x73/0xe0 mm/kmsan/kmsan_instr.c:250
    alauda_check_media+0x344/0x3310 drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:460

  The problem is that alauda_check_media() doesn't verify that its USB
  transfer succeeded before trying to use the received data.  What
  should happen if the transfer fails isn't entirely clear, but a
  reasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is
  present.

  A similar problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in
  alauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when an error occurs the
  call is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print
  a debugging message.

  Finally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact
  that alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack.
  Fortunately usb-storage provides a general purpose DMA-able buffer for
  uses like this.  We'll use it instead.
