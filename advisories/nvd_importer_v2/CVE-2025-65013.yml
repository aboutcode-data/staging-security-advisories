aliases: []
summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Prior
  to version 25.11.0, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in
  the LibreNMS application at the /maps/nodeimage endpoint. The Image Name parameter is reflected
  in the HTTP response without proper output encoding or sanitization, allowing an attacker
  to craft a URL that, when visited by a victim, causes arbitrary JavaScript execution in the
  victim’s browser. This issue has been patched in version 25.11.0.
