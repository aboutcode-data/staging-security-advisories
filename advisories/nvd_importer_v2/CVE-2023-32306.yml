aliases: []
summary: Time Tracker is an open source time tracking system. A time-based blind injection vulnerability
  existed in Time Tracker reports in versions prior to 1.22.13.5792. This was happening because
  the `reports.php` page was not validating all parameters in POST requests. Because some parameters
  were not checked, it was possible to craft POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker
  database. This issue is fixed in version 1.22.13.5792. As a workaround, use the fixed code
  in `ttReportHelper.class.php` from version 1.22.13.5792.
