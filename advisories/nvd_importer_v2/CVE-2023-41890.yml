aliases: []
summary: "Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites, allowing the web\
  \ site to act as a SAML2 Service Provider. \nPrior to versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2, when a response\
  \ is processed, the issuer of the Identity Provider is not sufficiently validated. This could\
  \ allow a malicious identity provider to craft a Saml2 response that is processed as if issued\
  \ by another identity provider. It is also possible for a malicious end user to cause stored\
  \ state intended for one identity provider to be used when processing the response from another\
  \ provider. An application is impacted if they rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization\
  \ logic: the issuer of the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request state\
  \ (AuthenticationProperties). This issue is patched in versions 2.9.2 and 1.0.3. The `AcsCommandResultCreated`\
  \ notification can be used to add the validation required if an upgrade to patched packages\
  \ is not possible."
