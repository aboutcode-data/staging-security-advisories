aliases: []
summary: The LazyTasks – Project & Task Management with Collaboration, Kanban and Gantt Chart
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.29. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity
  via the 'wp-json/lazytasks/api/v1/user/role/edit/' REST API endpoint prior to updating their
  details like email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change
  arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the
  user's password and gain access to their account. It is also possible for attackers to abuse
  this endpoint to grant users with access to additional roles within the plugin
