aliases: []
summary: The User Registration & Membership – Custom Registration Form Builder, Custom Login
  Form, User Profile, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.8. This is due to
  missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'process_row_actions' function with the 'delete'
  action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary post via
  a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
