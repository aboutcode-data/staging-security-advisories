aliases: []
summary: The Swift Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via several of the plugin's shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.31 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
  Unfortunately, we did not receive a response from the vendor to send over the vulnerability
  details.
