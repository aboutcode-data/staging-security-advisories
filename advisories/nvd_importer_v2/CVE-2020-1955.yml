aliases: []
summary: CouchDB version 3.0.0 shipped with a new configuration setting that governs access
  control to the entire database server called `require_valid_user_except_for_up`. It was meant
  as an extension to the long standing setting `require_valid_user`, which in turn requires
  that any and all requests to CouchDB will have to be made with valid credentials, effectively
  forbidding any anonymous requests. The new `require_valid_user_except_for_up` is an off-by-default
  setting that was meant to allow requiring valid credentials for all endpoints except for the
  `/_up` endpoint. However, the implementation of this made an error that lead to not enforcing
  credentials on any endpoint, when enabled. CouchDB versions 3.0.1[1] and 3.1.0[2] fix this
  issue.
