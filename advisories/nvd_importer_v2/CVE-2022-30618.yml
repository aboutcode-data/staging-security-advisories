aliases: []
summary: An authenticated user with access to the Strapi admin panel can view private and sensitive
  data, such as email and password reset tokens, for API users if content types accessible to
  the authenticated user contain relationships to API users (from:users-permissions). There
  are many scenarios in which such details from API users can leak in the JSON response within
  the admin panel, either through a direct or indirect relationship. Access to this information
  enables a user to compromise these users’ accounts if the password reset API endpoints have
  been enabled. In a worst-case scenario, a low-privileged user could get access to a high-privileged
  API account, and could read and modify any data as well as block access to both the admin
  panel and API by revoking privileges for all other users.
