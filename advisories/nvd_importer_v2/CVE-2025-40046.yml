  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/zcrx: fix overshooting recv limit

  It's reported that sometimes a zcrx request can receive more than was
  requested. It's caused by io_zcrx_recv_skb() adjusting desc->count for
  all received buffers including frag lists, but then doing recursive
  calls to process frag list skbs, which leads to desc->count double
  accounting and underflow.
