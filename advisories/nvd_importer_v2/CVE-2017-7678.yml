aliases: []
summary: In Apache Spark before 2.2.0, it is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a
  user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark
  cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data,
  which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could be evaluated
  and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the
  user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web
  UIs.
