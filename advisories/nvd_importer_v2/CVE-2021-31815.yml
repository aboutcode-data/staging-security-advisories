aliases: []
summary: 'GAEN (aka Google/Apple Exposure Notifications) through 2021-04-27 on Android allows
  attackers to obtain sensitive information, such as a user''s location history, in-person social
  graph, and (sometimes) COVID-19 infection status, because Rolling Proximity Identifiers and
  MAC addresses are written to the Android system log, and many Android devices have applications
  (preinstalled by the hardware manufacturer or network operator) that read system log data
  and send it to third parties. NOTE: a news outlet (The Markup) states that they received a
  vendor response indicating that fix deployment "began several weeks ago and will be complete
  in the coming days."'
