  fs: PM: Fix reverse check in filesystems_freeze_callback()

  The freeze_all_ptr check in filesystems_freeze_callback() introduced by
  commit a3f8f8662771 ("power: always freeze efivarfs") is reverse which
  quite confusingly causes all file systems to be frozen when
  filesystem_freeze_enabled is false.

  On my systems it causes the WARN_ON_ONCE() in __set_task_frozen() to
  trigger, most likely due to an attempt to freeze a file system that is
  not ready for that.

  Add a logical negation to the check in question to reverse it as
  appropriate.
