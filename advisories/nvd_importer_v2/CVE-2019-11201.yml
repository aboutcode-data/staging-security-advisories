aliases: []
summary: Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 provides a module named website that provides for creation of
  public websites with a WYSIWYG editor. It was identified that the editor also allowed inclusion
  of dynamic code, which can lead to code execution on the host machine. An attacker has to
  check a setting on the same page, which specifies the inclusion of dynamic content. Thus,
  a lower privileged user of the application can execute code under the context and permissions
  of the underlying web server.
