  \ due\nto data race. Each thread rewrite channels's descriptor as soon as\ndevice_issue_pending\
  \ is called. It leads to the situation that\nthe driver thinks that it uses the right descriptor\
  \ in interrupt\nhandler while channels's descriptor has been changed by other\nthread. The\
  \ descriptor which in fact reported interrupt will not\nbe handled any more, as well as its\
  \ tx->callback.\nThat's why timeout reports.\n\nWith current fixes channels' descriptor changes\
  \ it's value only\nwhen it has been used. A new descriptor is acquired from\nvc->desc_issued\
  \ queue that is already filled with descriptors\nthat are ready to be sent. Threads have no\
  \ direct access to DMA\nchannel descriptor. In case of channel's descriptor is busy, try\n\
  to submit to HW again when a descriptor is completed. In this case,\nvc->desc_issued may be\
  \ empty when hisi_dma_start_transfer is called,\nso delete error reporting on this. Now it\
  \ is just possible to queue\na descriptor for further processing."
