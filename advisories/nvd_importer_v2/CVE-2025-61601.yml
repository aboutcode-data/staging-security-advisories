aliases: []
summary: BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability
  in versions prior to 3.0.13 allows any authenticated user to freeze or crash the entire server
  by abusing the polling feature's `Choices` response type. By submitting a malicious payload
  with a massive array in the `answerIds` field, the attacker can cause the current meeting
  — and potentially all meetings on the server — to become unresponsive. Version 3.0.13 contains
  a patch. No known workarounds are available.
