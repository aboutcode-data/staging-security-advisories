aliases: []
summary: The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command injection. An attacker
  can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows drive
  letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a
  command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows
  drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell
  metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as
  the backtick character.
