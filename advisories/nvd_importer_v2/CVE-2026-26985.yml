summary: LORIS (Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System) is a self-hosted web application
  that provides data- and project-management for neuroimaging research. Starting in version
  24.0.0 and prior to versions 26.0.5, 27.0.2, and 28.0.0, an authenticated user with the appropriate
  authorization can read configuration files on the server by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability.
  Some of these files contain hard-coded credentials. The vulnerability allows an attacker to
  read configuration files containing hard-coded credentials. The attacker could then authenticate
  to the database or other services if those credentials are reused. The attacker must be authenticated
  and have the required permissions. However, the vulnerability is easy to exploit and the application
  source code is public. This problem is fixed in LORIS v26.0.5 and v27.0.2 and above, and v28.0.0
  and above. As a workaround, the electrophysiogy_browser in LORIS can be disabled by an administrator
  using the module manager.
