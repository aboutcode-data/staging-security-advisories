aliases: []
summary: Initiative is a self-hosted project management platform. Versions of the application
  prior to 0.32.4 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the document upload
  functionality. Any user with upload permissions within the "Initiatives" section can upload
  a malicious `.html` or `.htm` file as a document. Because the uploaded HTML file is served
  under the application's origin without proper sandboxing, the embedded JavaScript executes
  in the context of the application. As a result, authentication tokens, session cookies, or
  other sensitive data can be exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server. Additionally, since
  the uploaded file is hosted under the application's domain, simply sharing the direct file
  link may result in execution of the malicious script when accessed. Version 0.32.4 fixes the
  issue.
