aliases: []
summary: When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter
  key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation
  occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would
  have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it. This vulnerability affects
  Firefox < 84.
