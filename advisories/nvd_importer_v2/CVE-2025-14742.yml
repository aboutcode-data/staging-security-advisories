aliases: []
summary: The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data
  due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_search_recipes' and 'ajax_get_recipe' functions
  in all versions up to, and including, 10.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive recipe information including
  draft, pending, and private recipes that they shouldn't be able to access.
