aliases: []
summary: Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to version 0.6.2,
  a security vulnerability in Soft Serve could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  bypass public key authentication when keyboard-interactive SSH authentication is active, through
  the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public key requires additional client-side verification
  for example using FIDO2 or GPG. This is due to insufficient validation procedures of the public
  key step during SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized access if the keyboard-interaction
  mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting manipulated SSH
  requests using keyboard-interactive authentication mode. This could potentially result in
  unauthorized access to the Soft Serve. Users should upgrade to the latest Soft Serve version
  `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this issue. To workaround this vulnerability without upgrading,
  users can temporarily disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the `allow-keyless`
  setting.
