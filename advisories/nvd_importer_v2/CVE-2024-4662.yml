aliases: []
summary: The Oxygen Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all
  versions up to, and including, 4.8.2 via post metadata. This is due to the plugin storing
  custom data in post metadata without an underscore prefix. This makes it possible for lower
  privileged users, such as contributors, to inject arbitrary PHP code via the WordPress user
  interface and gain elevated privileges.
