summary: The Ninja Forms – The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.12.0.
  This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the maybe_opt_in() function. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to opt an affected site into usage statistics

  an action such as clicking on a link.
