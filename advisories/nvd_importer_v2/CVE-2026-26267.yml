summary: 'soroban-sdk is a Rust SDK for Soroban contracts. Prior to versions 22.0.10, 23.5.2,
  and 25.1.1, the `#[contractimpl]` macro contains a bug in how it wires up function calls.
  `#[contractimpl]` generates code that uses `MyContract::value()` style calls even when it''s
  processing the trait version. This means if an inherent function is also defined with the
  same name, the inherent function gets called instead of the trait function. This means the
  Wasm-exported entry point silently calls the wrong function when two conditions are met simultaneously:
  First, an `impl Trait for MyContract` block is defined with one or more functions, with `#[contractimpl]`
  applied. Second, an `impl MyContract` block is defined with one or more identically named
  functions, without `#[contractimpl]` applied. If the trait version contains important security
  checks, such as verifying the caller is authorized, that the inherent version does not, those
  checks are bypassed. Anyone interacting with the contract through its public interface will
  call the wrong function. The problem is patched in `soroban-sdk-macros` versions 22.0.10,
  23.5.2, and 25.1.1. The fix changes the generated call from `<Type>::func()` to `<Type as
  Trait>::func()` when processing trait implementations, ensuring Rust resolves to the trait
  associated function regardless of whether an inherent function with the same name exists.
  Users should upgrade to `soroban-sdk-macros` 22.0.10, 23.5.2, or 25.1.1 and recompile their
  contracts. If upgrading is not immediately possible, contract developers can avoid the issue
  by ensuring that no inherent associated function on the contract type shares a name with any
  function in the trait implementation. Renaming or removing the conflicting inherent function
  eliminates the ambiguity and causes the macro-generated code to correctly resolve to the trait
  function.'
