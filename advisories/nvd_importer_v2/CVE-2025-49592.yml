aliases: []
summary: n8n is a workflow automation platform. Versions prior to 1.98.0 have an Open Redirect
  vulnerability in the login flow. Authenticated users can be redirected to untrusted, attacker-controlled
  domains after logging in, by crafting malicious URLs with a misleading redirect query parameter.
  This may lead to phishing attacks by impersonating the n8n UI on lookalike domains (e.g.,
  n8n.local.evil.com), credential or 2FA theft if users are tricked into re-entering sensitive
  information, and/or reputation risk due to the visual similarity between attacker-controlled
  domains and trusted ones. The vulnerability affects anyone hosting n8n and exposing the `/signin`
  endpoint to users. The issue has been patched in version 1.98.0. All users should upgrade
  to this version or later. The fix introduces strict origin validation for redirect URLs, ensuring
  only same-origin or relative paths are allowed after login.
