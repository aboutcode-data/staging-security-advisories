aliases: []
summary: The Five Star Restaurant Reservations WordPress plugin before 2.4.12 does not have
  authorisation when changing whether a payment was successful or failed, allowing unauthenticated
  users to change the payment status of arbitrary bookings. Furthermore, due to the lack of
  sanitisation and escaping, attackers could perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against a
  logged in admin viewing the failed payments
