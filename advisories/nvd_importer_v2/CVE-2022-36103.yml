aliases: []
summary: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker
  nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation
  of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control
  plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control
  plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal
  sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos
  PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node.
  When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration,
  but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the
  join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards
  mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the
  baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with
  correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to
  cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server)
  are not affected.
