aliases: []
summary: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, the application's
  BasePage registers an AJAX event listener (`AbstractPostAjaxBehavior`) in all pages other
  than the login page. This listener decodes and deserializes the `data` query parameter. We
  can access this listener by submitting a POST request to any page. This issue may lead to
  `post-auth RCE` This endpoint is subject to authentication and, therefore, requires a valid
  user to carry on the attack. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by encrypting serialization
  payload with secrets only known to server.
