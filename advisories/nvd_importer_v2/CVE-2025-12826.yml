aliases: []
summary: The Custom Post Type UI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.18.0. This is due to the plugin not verifying that
  a user has the required capability to perform actions in the "cptui_process_post_type" function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above,
  to add, edit, or delete custom post types in limited situations.
