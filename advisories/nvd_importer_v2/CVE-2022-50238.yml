aliases: []
summary: 'The on-endpoint Microsoft vulnerable driver blocklist is not fully synchronized with
  the online Microsoft recommended driver block rules. Some entries present on the online list
  have been excluded from the on-endpoint blocklist longer than the expected periodic monthly
  Windows updates. It is possible to fully synchronize the driver blocklist using WDAC policies.
  NOTE: The vendor explains that Windows Update provides a smaller, compatibility-focused driver
  blocklist for general users, while the full XML list is available for advanced users and organizations
  to customize at the risk of usability issues.'
