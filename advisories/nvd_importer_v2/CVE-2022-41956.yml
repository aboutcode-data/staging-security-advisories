aliases: []
summary: 'Autolab is a course management service, initially developed by a team of students
  at Carnegie Mellon University, that enables instructors to offer autograded programming assignments
  to their students over the Web. A file disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Autolab''s
  remote handin feature, whereby users are able to hand-in assignments using paths outside their
  submission directory. Users can then view the submission to view the file''s contents. The
  vulnerability has been patched in version 2.10.0. As a workaround, ensure that the field for
  the remote handin feature is empty (Edit Assessment > Advanced > Remote handin path), and
  that you are not running Autolab as `root` (or any user that has write access to `/`). Alternatively,
  disable the remote handin feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of `local_submit`
  in `app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb` with `render(plain: "Feature disabled", status:
  :bad_request) && return`.'
