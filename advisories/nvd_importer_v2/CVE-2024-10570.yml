aliases: []
summary: The Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  SQL Injection due to an authorization bypass via reverse DNS spoofing on the checkWithoutToken
  function in all versions up to, and including, 2.145, as well as insufficient input sanitization
  and validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database.
