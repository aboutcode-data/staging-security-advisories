aliases: []
summary: EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, an integer overflow
  occurring in `SdpPacket::parse_header()` allows the current buffer length to be set to 7 after
  a complete header of size 8 has been read. The remaining length to read is computed using
  the current length subtracted by the header length which results in a negative value. This
  value is then interpreted as `SIZE_MAX` (or slightly less) because the expected type of the
  argument is `size_t`. Depending on whether the server is plain TCP or TLS, this leads to either
  an infinite loop or a stack buffer overflow. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.
