summary: The Notification Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'subscriber-list-empty.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to empty the subscriber list via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
