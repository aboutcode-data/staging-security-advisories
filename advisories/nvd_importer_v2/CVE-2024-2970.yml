aliases: []
summary: The News Wall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the nwap_newslist_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update the plugin's settings and modify news lists via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
