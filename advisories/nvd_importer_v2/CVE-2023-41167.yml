aliases: []
summary: '@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer before 5.37.2 allows XSS attacks by content managers.
  This is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder.
  Webiny is an open-source serverless enterprise CMS. The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer package
  depends on the editor.js rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich
  text content from the editor.js into the database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer
  is used to render such content, it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, without applying
  HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically
  be a content manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined
  input. This script is then injected and executed within the user''s browser when the main
  page or admin page loads.'
