summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IoT Field Network Director
  (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attack and alter the data of existing users and groups on an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface
  on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of
  the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has administrative
  privileges, the attacker could create a new, privileged account to obtain full control over
  the device interface. This vulnerability affects Connected Grid Network Management System,
  if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 3.0; and IoT Field Network Director,
  if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.1.1-6 or 4.2.0-123. Cisco Bug IDs:
  CSCvi02448.'
