  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Fix exclusive map memory leak

  When excl_prog_hash is 0 and excl_prog_hash_size is non-zero, the map also
  needs to be freed. Otherwise, the map memory will not be reclaimed, just
  like the memory leak problem reported by syzbot [1].

  syzbot reported:
  BUG: memory leak
