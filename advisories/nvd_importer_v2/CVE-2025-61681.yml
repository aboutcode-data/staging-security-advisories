aliases: []
summary: KUNO CMS is a fully deployable full-stack blog application. Versions 1.3.13 and below
  contain validation flaws in its file upload functionality that can be exploited for stored
  XSS. The upload endpoint only validates file types based on Content-Type headers, lacks file
  content analysis and extension whitelist restrictions, allowing attackers to upload SVG files
  containing malicious scripts (disguised as images). When users access the uploaded resource
  pages, arbitrary JavaScript executes in their browsers. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.14.
