aliases: []
summary: In SmartDraw 2020 27.0.0.0, the installer gives inherited write permissions to the
  Authenticated Users group on the SmartDraw 2020 installation folder. Additionally, when the
  product is installed, two scheduled tasks are created on the machine, SDMsgUpdate (Local)
  and SDMsgUpdate (TE). The scheduled tasks run in the context of the user who installed the
  product. Both scheduled tasks attempt to run the same binary, C:\SmartDraw 2020\Messages\SDNotify.exe.
  The folder Messages doesn't exist by default and (by extension) neither does SDNotify.exe.
  Due to the weak folder permissions, these can be created by any user. A malicious actor can
  therefore create a malicious SDNotify.exe binary, and have it automatically run, whenever
  the user who installed the product logs on to the machine. The malicious SDNotify.exe could,
  for example, create a new local administrator account on the machine.
