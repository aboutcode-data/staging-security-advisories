aliases: []
summary: 'discourse-footnote is a library providing footnotes for posts in Discourse. ### Impact
  When posting an inline footnote wrapped in `<a>` tags (e.g. `<a>^[footnote]</a>`, the resulting
  rendered HTML would include a nested `<a>`, which is stripped by Nokogiri because it is not
  valid. This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because we were looking for an `<a>`
  element inside the footnote reference span and getting its ID, and because it did not exist
  we got a null reference error in javascript. Users are advised to update to version 0.2. As
  a workaround editing offending posts from the rails console or the database console for self-hosters,
  or disabling the plugin in the admin panel can mitigate this issue.'
