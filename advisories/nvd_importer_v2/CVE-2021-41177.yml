aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 20.0.13,
  21.0.5, and 22.2.0, Nextcloud Server did not implement a database backend for rate-limiting
  purposes. Any component of Nextcloud using rate-limits (as as `AnonRateThrottle` or `UserRateThrottle`)
  was thus not rate limited on instances not having a memory cache backend configured. In the
  case of a default installation, this would notably include the rate-limits on the two factor
  codes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5, or 22.2.0.
  As a workaround, enable a memory cache backend in `config.php`.
