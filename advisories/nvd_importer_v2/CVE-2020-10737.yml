aliases: []
summary: A race condition was found in the mkhomedir tool shipped with the oddjob package in
  versions before 0.34.5 and 0.34.6 wherein, during the home creation, mkhomedir copies the
  /etc/skel directory into the newly created home and changes its ownership to the home's user
  without properly checking the homedir path. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this
  issue by creating a symlink point to a target folder, which then has its ownership transferred
  to the new home directory's unprivileged user.
