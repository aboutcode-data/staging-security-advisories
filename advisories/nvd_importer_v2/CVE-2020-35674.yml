aliases: []
summary: BigProf Online Invoicing System before 2.9 suffers from an unauthenticated SQL Injection
  found in /membership_passwordReset.php (the endpoint that is responsible for issuing self-service
  password resets). An unauthenticated attacker is able to send a request containing a crafted
  payload that can result in sensitive information being extracted from the database, eventually
  leading into an application takeover. This vulnerability was introduced as a result of the
  developer trying to roll their own sanitization implementation in order to allow the application
  to be used in legacy environments.
