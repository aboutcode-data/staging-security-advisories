aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 3.1.3
  of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches,
  there is an edge case where a bookmark reminder is sent and an unread notification is generated,
  but the underlying bookmarkable (e.g. post, topic, chat message) security has changed, making
  it so the user can no longer access the underlying resource. As of version 3.1.3 of the `stable`
  branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, bookmark reminders
  are now no longer sent if the user does not have access to the underlying bookmarkable, and
  also the unread bookmark notifications are always filtered by access. There are no known workarounds.
