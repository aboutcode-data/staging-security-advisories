summary: 'A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) security
  services of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute
  arbitrary code on an affected device or cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a

  device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected
  device or cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability
