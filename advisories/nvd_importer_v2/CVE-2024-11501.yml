summary: The Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.3 via deserialization of untrusted input from wd_gallery_$id parameter.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above,

  chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could
  allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
