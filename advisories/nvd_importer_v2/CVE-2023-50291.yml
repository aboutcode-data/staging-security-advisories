summary: |
  Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.

  This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
  One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.
  There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.
  This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.

  This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.
  Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.
  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
  A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".
  By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".

  Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:
    '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'
