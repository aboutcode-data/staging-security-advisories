aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Viber before 10.7.0 for Desktop (Windows) could allow an attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due to unsafe search
  paths used by the application URI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing
  a targeted user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could cause the application
  to load libraries from the directory targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this
  behavior to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the targeted user,
  if the attacker can place a crafted library in a directory that is accessible to the vulnerable
  system.
