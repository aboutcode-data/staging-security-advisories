aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest version of
  mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing attackers to bypass the official fix intended to restrict
  access to intranet IP addresses and protocols. Despite efforts to filter out intranet IP addresses
  starting with 192, 172, 10, and 127 through regular expressions and limit access protocols
  to HTTP and HTTPS, attackers can still bypass these restrictions using alternative representations
  of IP addresses and accessing other ports running on localhost. This vulnerability enables
  attackers to access any asset on the internal network, attack web services on the internal
  network, scan hosts on the internal network, and potentially access AWS metadata endpoints.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, which can be exploited
  to perform SSRF attacks.
