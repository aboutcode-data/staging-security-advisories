summary: "A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Catalyst Center could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands in a restricted container as the root user.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in REST\
  \ API request parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted\
  \ API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject\
  \ arbitrary commands that would then be executed in a restricted container with root privileges.\
  \ To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account\
  \ with at least the role of Observer."
