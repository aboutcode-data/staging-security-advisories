aliases: []
summary: The statistics generator in Apache Pony Mail 0.7 to 0.9 was found to be returning timestamp
  data without proper authorization checks. This could lead to derived information disclosure
  on private lists about the timing of specific email subjects or text bodies, though without
  disclosing the content itself. As this was primarily used as a caching feature for faster
  loading times, the caching was disabled by default to prevent this. Users using 0.9 should
  upgrade to 0.10 to address this issue.
