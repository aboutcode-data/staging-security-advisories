summary: The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in versions
  up to, and including, 10.2.2 via the api_get_post_summary function due to insufficient restrictions
  on which posts can be retrieved. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from posts they may not be able to edit
  or read otherwise. This also affects password protected, private, or draft posts that they
  should not have access to.
