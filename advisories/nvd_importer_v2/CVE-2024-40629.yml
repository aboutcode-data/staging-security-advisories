aliases: []
summary: JumpServer is an open-source Privileged Access Management (PAM) tool that provides
  DevOps and IT teams with on-demand and secure access to SSH, RDP, Kubernetes, Database and
  RemoteApp endpoints through a web browser. An attacker can exploit the Ansible playbook to
  write arbitrary files, leading to remote code execution (RCE) in the Celery container. The
  Celery container runs as root and has database access, allowing an attacker to steal all secrets
  for hosts, create a new JumpServer account with admin privileges, or manipulate the database
  in other ways. This issue has been patched in release versions 3.10.12 and 4.0.0. It is recommended
  to upgrade the safe versions. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
