aliases: []
summary: homeassistant is an open source home automation tool. A remotely exploitable vulnerability
  bypassing authentication for accessing the Supervisor API through Home Assistant has been
  discovered. This impacts all Home Assistant installation types that use the Supervisor 2023.01.1
  or older. Installation types, like Home Assistant Container (for example Docker), or Home
  Assistant Core manually in a Python environment, are not affected. The issue has been mitigated
  and closed in Supervisor version 2023.03.1, which has been rolled out to all affected installations
  via the auto-update feature of the Supervisor. This rollout has been completed at the time
  of publication of this advisory. Home Assistant Core 2023.3.0 included mitigation for this
  vulnerability. Upgrading to at least that version is thus advised. In case one is not able
  to upgrade the Home Assistant Supervisor or the Home Assistant Core application at this time,
  it is advised to not expose your Home Assistant instance to the internet.
