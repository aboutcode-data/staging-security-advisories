aliases: []
summary: ORY Fosite is a security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go. In Fosite
  before version 0.34.1, the OAuth 2.0 Client's registered redirect URLs and the redirect URL
  provided at the OAuth2 Authorization Endpoint where compared using strings.ToLower while they
  should have been compared with a simple string match. This allows an attacker to register
  a client with allowed redirect URL https://example.com/callback. Then perform an OAuth2 flow
  and requesting redirect URL https://example.com/CALLBACK. Instead of an error (invalid redirect
  URL), the browser is redirected to https://example.com/CALLBACK with a potentially successful
  OAuth2 response, depending on the state of the overall OAuth2 flow (the user might still deny
  the request for example). This vulnerability has been patched in ORY Fosite v0.34.1.
