summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XR Software image verification checks could allow an\
  \ authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability is due to a time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition when\
  \ an install query regarding an ISO image is performed during an install operation that uses\
  \ an ISO image. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying an ISO image and\
  \ then carrying out install requests in parallel. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary code on an affected device."
