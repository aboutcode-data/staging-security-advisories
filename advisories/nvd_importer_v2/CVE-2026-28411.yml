summary: WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to version 3.6.5, an unsafe
  use of the `extract()` function on the `$_REQUEST` superglobal allows an unauthenticated attacker
  to overwrite local variables in multiple PHP scripts. This vulnerability can be leveraged
  to completely bypass authentication checks, allowing unauthorized access to administrative
  and protected areas of the WeGIA application. Version 3.6.5 fixes the issue.
