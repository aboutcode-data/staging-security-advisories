  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/hugetlb: fix folio is still mapped when deleted

  Migration may be raced with fallocating hole.  remove_inode_single_folio
  will unmap the folio if the folio is still mapped.  However, it's called
  without folio lock.  If the folio is migrated and the mapped pte has been
  converted to migration entry, folio_mapped() returns false, and won't
  unmap it.  Due to extra refcount held by remove_inode_single_folio,
  migration fails, restores migration entry to normal pte, and the folio is
  mapped again.  As a result, we triggered BUG in filemap_unaccount_folio.

  The log is as follows:
