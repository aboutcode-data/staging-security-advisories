aliases: []
summary: Azure IPAM (IP Address Management) is a lightweight solution developed on top of the
  Azure platform designed to help Azure customers manage their IP Address space easily and effectively.
  By design there is no write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal
  used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group level. Until recently,
  the solution lacked the validation of the passed in authentication token which may result
  in attacker impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the IPAM instance
  and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of privilege. This vulnerability has been
  patched in version 3.0.0.
