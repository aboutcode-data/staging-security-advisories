summary: CometBFT is a distributed, Byzantine fault-tolerant, deterministic state machine replication
  engine. In the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they
  connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower
  ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest`
  height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report
  increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest`
  height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights. The existing
  code however doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately
  after height `Y`, where `X > Y`. `A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. This
  condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting some
  non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing
  using `blocksync` protocol. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.1 and 0.38.17 and
  all users are advised to upgrade. Operators may attempt to ban malicious peers from the network
  as a workaround.
