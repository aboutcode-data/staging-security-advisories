aliases: []
summary: VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain a heap-overflow vulnerability in the PVSCSI
  (Paravirtualized SCSI) controller that leads to an out of-bounds write. A malicious actor
  with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute
  code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. On ESXi, the exploitation is
  contained within the VMX sandbox and exploitable only with configurations that are unsupported.
  On Workstation and Fusion, this may lead to code execution on the machine where Workstation
  or Fusion is installed.
