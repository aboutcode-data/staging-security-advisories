  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hwmon: (acpi_power_meter) Fix deadlocks related to acpi_power_meter_notify()

  The acpi_power_meter driver's .notify() callback function,
  acpi_power_meter_notify(), calls hwmon_device_unregister() under a lock
  that is also acquired by callbacks in sysfs attributes of the device
  being unregistered which is prone to deadlocks between sysfs access and
  device removal.

  Address this by moving the hwmon device removal in
  acpi_power_meter_notify() outside the lock in question, but notice
  that doing it alone is not sufficient because two concurrent
  METER_NOTIFY_CONFIG notifications may be attempting to remove the
  same device at the same time.  To prevent that from happening, add a
  new lock serializing the execution of the switch () statement in
  acpi_power_meter_notify().  For simplicity, it is a static mutex
  which should not be a problem from the performance perspective.

  The new lock also allows the hwmon_device_register_with_info()
  in acpi_power_meter_notify() to be called outside the inner lock
  because it prevents the other notifications handled by that function
  from manipulating the "resource" object while the hwmon device based
  on it is being registered.  The sending of ACPI netlink messages from
  acpi_power_meter_notify() is serialized by the new lock too which
  generally helps to ensure that the order of handling firmware
  notifications is the same as the order of sending netlink messages
  related to them.

  In addition, notice that hwmon_device_register_with_info() may fail
  in which case resource->hwmon_dev will become an error pointer,
  so add checks to avoid attempting to unregister the hwmon device
  pointer to by it in that case to acpi_power_meter_notify() and
  acpi_power_meter_remove().
