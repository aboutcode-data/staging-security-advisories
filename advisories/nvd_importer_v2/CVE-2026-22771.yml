aliases: []
summary: Envoy Gateway is an open source project for managing Envoy Proxy as a standalone or
  Kubernetes-based application gateway. Prior to 1.5.7 and 1.6.2, EnvoyExtensionPolicy Lua scripts
  executed by Envoy proxy can be used to leak the proxy's credentials. These credentials can
  then be used to communicate with the control plane and gain access to all secrets that are
  used by Envoy proxy, e.g. TLS private keys and credentials used for downstream and upstream
  communication. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.7 and 1.6.2.
