aliases: []
summary: Local attackers can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow on vulnerable installations
  of Antiy-AVL ATool security management v1.0.0.22. An attacker must first obtain the ability
  to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
  The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x80002000 by the IRPFile.sys Antiy-AVL
  ATool kernel driver. The bug is caused by failure to properly validate the length of the user-supplied
  data, which results in a kernel stack buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, which could lead to privilege escalation
  and a failed exploit could lead to denial of service.
