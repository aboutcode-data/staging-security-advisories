  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  octeon_ep: Fix memory leak in octep_device_setup()

  In octep_device_setup(), if octep_ctrl_net_init() fails, the function
  returns directly without unmapping the mapped resources and freeing the
  allocated configuration memory.

  Fix this by jumping to the unsupported_dev label, which performs the
  necessary cleanup. This aligns with the error handling logic of other
  paths in this function.

  Compile tested only. Issue found using a prototype static analysis tool
  and code review.
