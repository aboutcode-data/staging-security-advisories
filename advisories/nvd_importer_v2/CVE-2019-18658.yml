aliases: []
summary: In Helm 2.x before 2.15.2, commands that deal with loading a chart as a directory or
  packaging a chart provide an opportunity for a maliciously designed chart to include sensitive
  content such as /etc/passwd, or to execute a denial of service (DoS) via a special file such
  as /dev/urandom, via symlinks. No version of Tiller is known to be impacted. This is a client-only
  issue.
