aliases: []
summary: tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. Prior to version 1.22.0,
  a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed
  without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an
  HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script
  to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior
  or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments,
  named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control
  over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron. This issue has
  been patched in version 1.22.0.
