aliases: []
summary: A type confusion issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2, leading to a memory access violation
  and a failure of the nonce feature (which, for example, helped with loop prevention). ccnl_fwd_handleInterest
  assumes that the union member s is of type ccnl_pktdetail_ndntlv_s. However, if the type is
  in fact struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s or struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s, the memory at that
  point is either uninitialised or points to data that is not a nonce, which renders the code
  using the local variable nonce pointless. A later nonce check is insufficient.
