summary: "Overview \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname\
  \ that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize '.../...//'\
  \ (doubled triple dot slash) sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that\
  \ directory. (CWE-35) \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDescription \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHitachi Vantara Pentaho\
  \ Data Integration & Analytics versions before 10.2.0.2, including 9.3.x and 8.3.x, do not\
  \ sanitize a user input used as a file path through the UploadFile service. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\
  \nImpact \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files\
  \ or directories that are outside of the restricted directory."
