aliases: []
summary: calibre is an e-book manager. Prior to 9.2.0, Calibre's CHM reader contains a path
  traversal vulnerability that allows arbitrary file writes anywhere the user has write permissions.
  On Windows (haven't tested on other OS's), this can lead to Remote Code Execution by writing
  a payload to the Startup folder, which executes on next login. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 9.2.0.
