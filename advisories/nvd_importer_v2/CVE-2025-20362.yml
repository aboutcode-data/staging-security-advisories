summary: "Update: On November 5, 2025, Cisco became aware of a new attack variant against devices\
  \ running Cisco Secure ASA Software or Cisco Secure FTD Software releases that are affected\
  \ by CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362. This attack can cause unpatched devices to unexpectedly\
  \ reload, leading to denial of service (DoS) conditions. Cisco strongly recommends that all\
  \ customers upgrade to the fixed software releases that are listed in the Fixed Software [\"\
  #fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r A vulnerability in the VPN web server of Cisco Secure\
  \ Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense\
  \ (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access restricted URL\
  \ endpoints that are related to remote access VPN that should otherwise be inaccessible without\
  \ authentication.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied\
  \ input in HTTP(S) requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted\
  \ HTTP requests to a targeted web server on a device. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to access a restricted URL without authentication."
