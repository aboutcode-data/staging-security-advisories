summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation
  IoT devices. An attacker can trigger out-of-bounds reads in the RPL-Lite implementation of
  the RPL protocol in the Contiki-NG operating system. This vulnerability is caused by insufficient
  control of the lengths for DIO and DAO messages, in particular when they contain RPL sub-option
  headers. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.9. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
  unable to upgrade should manually apply the code changes in PR #2484.'
