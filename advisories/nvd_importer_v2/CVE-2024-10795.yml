summary: The Popularis Extra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.2.7 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient
  restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created
  via Elementor that they should not have access to.
