aliases: []
summary: The com.uaudio.bsd.helper service, responsible for handling privileged operations,
  fails to implement critical client validation during XPC inter-process communication (IPC).
  Specifically, the service does not verify the code requirements, entitlements, or security
  flags of any client attempting to establish a connection. This lack of proper validation allows
  unauthorized clients to exploit the service's methods and escalate privileges to root.
