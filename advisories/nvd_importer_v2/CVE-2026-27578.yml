aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3,
  and 1.123.22, an authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could inject
  arbitrary scripts into pages rendered by the n8n application using different techniques on
  various nodes (Form Trigger node, Chat Trigger node, Send & Wait node, Webhook Node, and Chat
  Node). Scripts injected by a malicious workflow execute in the browser of any user who visits
  the affected page, enabling session hijacking and account takeover. The issues have been fixed
  in n8n versions 2.10.1 and 1.123.21. Users should upgrade to one of these versions or later
  to remediate the vulnerability. If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should
  consider the following temporary mitigations. Limit workflow creation and editing permissions
  to fully trusted users only, and/or disable the Webhook node by adding `n8n-nodes-base.webhook`
  to the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable. These workarounds do not fully remediate the
  risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.
