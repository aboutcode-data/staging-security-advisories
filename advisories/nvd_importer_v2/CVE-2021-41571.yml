aliases: []
summary: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong
  to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires
  the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it
  is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the
  topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of
  such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data
  owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and
  prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4
  and prior versions.
