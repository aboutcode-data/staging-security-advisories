aliases: []
summary: 'The original design of ICMP does not require authentication for host-generated ICMP
  error messages, which makes it easier for attackers to forge ICMP error messages for specific
  TCP connections and cause a denial of service, as demonstrated using (1) blind connection-reset
  attacks with forged "Destination Unreachable" messages, (2) blind throughput-reduction attacks
  with forged "Source Quench" messages, or (3) blind throughput-reduction attacks with forged
  ICMP messages that cause the Path MTU to be reduced.  NOTE: CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791,
  and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066,
  CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying
  vulnerability.  While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers
  exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations and solutions that address
  the attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities.'
