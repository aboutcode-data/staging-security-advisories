aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress, used by the Service Finder - Directory
  and Job Board WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to,
  and including, 5.1. This is due to a lack of restriction on user role in the 'nsl_registration_store_extra_input'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an account on the
  site with an arbitrary role, including Administrator, when registering via a social login.
  The Nextend Social Login plugin must be installed and configured to exploit the vulnerability.
