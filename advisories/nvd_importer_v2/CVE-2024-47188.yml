aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network
  Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed
  for "thash" leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can
  lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance
  degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.
