aliases: []
summary: The The Pojo Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution
  via form_preview_shortcode AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.7. This is
  due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a
  value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This was partially fixed
  in version 1.4.8.
