aliases: []
summary: |
  An issue was discovered in 5.2 before 5.2.9, 5.1 before 5.1.15, and 4.2 before 4.2.27.
  `FilteredRelation` is subject to SQL injection in column aliases, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the `**kwargs` passed to `QuerySet.annotate()` or `QuerySet.alias()` on PostgreSQL.
  Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected.
  Django would like to thank Stackered for reporting this issue.
