  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/damon/core: fix potential memory leak by cleaning ops_filter in damon_destroy_scheme

  Currently, damon_destroy_scheme() only cleans up the filter list but
  leaves ops_filter untouched, which could lead to memory leaks when a
  scheme is destroyed.

  This patch ensures both filter and ops_filter are properly freed in
  damon_destroy_scheme(), preventing potential memory leaks.
