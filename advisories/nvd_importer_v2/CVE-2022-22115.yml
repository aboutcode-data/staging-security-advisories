aliases: []
summary: In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS) in the name of a created Tag. Since the Tag name is not being sanitized properly in
  the edit tag page, a low privileged attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the
  Tag. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged
  administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account
  Takeover of the administrator, and privileges escalation.
