summary: A UI misrepresentation vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that
  allowed more permissions to be granted during a GitHub App's user-authorization web flow than
  was displayed to the user during approval. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would
  need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through
  the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during
  the first authorization, but if the user later updated the set of repositories the app was
  installed on after the GitHub App had configured additional user-level permissions, those
  additional permissions would not be displayed, leading to more permissions being granted than
  the user potentially intended. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise
  Server prior to 3.3 and was fixed in versions 3.2.5, 3.1.13, 3.0.21. This vulnerability was
  reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
