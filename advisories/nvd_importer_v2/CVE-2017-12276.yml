aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web framework code for the SQL database interface of the Cisco
  Prime Collaboration Provisioning application could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to impact the confidentiality and integrity of the application by executing arbitrary SQL
  queries, aka SQL Injection. The attacker could read or write information from the SQL database.
  The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation on user-supplied input within SQL
  queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain
  malicious SQL statements to the affected application. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to determine the presence of certain values and write malicious input in the SQL database.
  The attacker would need to have valid user credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime
  Collaboration Provisioning Software Releases prior to 12.3. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf47935.'
