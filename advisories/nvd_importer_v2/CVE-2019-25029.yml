aliases: []
summary: In Versa Director, the command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution
  of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection
  attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies,
  HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system
  commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection
  attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.
