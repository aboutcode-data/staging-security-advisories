aliases: []
summary: The read command is used to read the keyboard input from the user, while reads it keeps
  the input length in a 32-bit integer value which is further used to reallocate the line buffer
  to accept the next character. During this process, with a line big enough it's possible to
  make this variable to overflow leading to a out-of-bounds write in the heap based buffer.
  This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and secure boot bypass
  is not discarded as consequence.
