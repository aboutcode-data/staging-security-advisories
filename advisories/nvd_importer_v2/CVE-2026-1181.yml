aliases: []
summary: Altium 365 workspace endpoints were configured with an overly permissive Cross-Origin
  Resource Sharing (CORS) policy that allowed credentialed cross-origin requests from other
  Altium-controlled subdomains, including forum.live.altium.com. As a result, JavaScript executing
  on those origins could access authenticated workspace APIs in the context of a logged-in user.
  When chained with vulnerabilities in those external applications, this misconfiguration enables
  unauthorized access to workspace data, administrative actions, and bypass of IP allowlisting
  controls, including in GovCloud environments.
