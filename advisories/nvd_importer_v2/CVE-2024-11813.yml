summary: The Pulsating Chat Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
