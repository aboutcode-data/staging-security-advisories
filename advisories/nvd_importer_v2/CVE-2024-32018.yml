aliases: []
summary: RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of devices
  that are typically 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. Most codebases define assertion
  macros which compile to a no-op on non-debug builds. If assertions are the only line of defense
  against untrusted input, the software may be exposed to attacks that leverage the lack of
  proper input checks. In detail, in the `nimble_scanlist_update()` function below, `len` is
  checked in an assertion and subsequently used in a call to `memcpy()`. If an attacker is able
  to provide a larger `len` value while assertions are compiled-out, they can write past the
  end of the fixed-length `e->ad` buffer. If the unchecked input above is attacker-controlled
  and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerability could range
  from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. This issue has not yet been patched. Users
  are advised to add manual `len` checking.
