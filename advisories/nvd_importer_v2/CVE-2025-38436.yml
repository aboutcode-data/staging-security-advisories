summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/scheduler: signal scheduled fence when kill job

  When an entity from application B is killed, drm_sched_entity_kill()
  removes all jobs belonging to that entity through
  drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work(). If application A's job depends on a
  scheduled fence from application B's job, and that fence is not properly
  signaled during the killing process, application A's dependency cannot be
  cleared.

  This leads to application A hanging indefinitely while waiting for a
  dependency that will never be resolved. Fix this issue by ensuring that
  scheduled fences are properly signaled when an entity is killed, allowing
  dependent applications to continue execution.
