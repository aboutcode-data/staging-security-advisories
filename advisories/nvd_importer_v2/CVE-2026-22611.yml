aliases: []
summary: AWS SDK for .NET works with Amazon Web Services to help build scalable solutions with
  Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Glacier, and more. From versions 4.0.0 to before 4.0.3.3,
  Customer applications could be configured to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent
  or non-AWS hosts. This notification is related to the use of specific values for the region
  input field when calling AWS services. An actor with access to the environment in which the
  SDK is used could set the region input field to an invalid value. This issue has been patched
  in version 4.0.3.3.
