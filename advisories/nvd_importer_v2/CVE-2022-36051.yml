aliases: []
summary: ZITADEL combines the ease of Auth0 and the versatility of Keycloak.**Actions**, introduced
  in ZITADEL **1.42.0** on the API and **1.56.0** for Console, is a feature, where users with
  role.`ORG_OWNER` are able to create Javascript Code, which is invoked by the system at certain
  points during the login. **Actions**, for example, allow creating authorizations (user grants)
  on newly created users programmatically. Due to a missing authorization check, **Actions**
  were able to grant authorizations for projects that belong to other organizations inside the
  same Instance. Granting authorizations via API and Console is not affected by this vulnerability.
  There is currently no known workaround, users should update.
