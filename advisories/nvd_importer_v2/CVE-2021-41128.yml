aliases: []
summary: Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and case data in connection
  with communicable diseases. In affected versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain
  a CSV Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit formula as exported
  fields which then get executed upon ingestion of the exported file. There is no validation
  or sanitization of these formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This
  vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no workarounds and all users
  are advised to upgrade their package.
