aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf: Ensure swevent hrtimer is properly destroyed

  With the change to hrtimer_try_to_cancel() in
  perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer() it appears possible for the hrtimer to
  still be active by the time the event gets freed.

  Make sure the event does a full hrtimer_cancel() on the free path by
  installing a perf_event::destroy handler.
