aliases: []
summary: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika chat
  feature, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads into the chat input. This vulnerability
  is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization on both the frontend and backend components
  of the application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user input in the chat
  feature, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's
  browser session. This issue affects all versions of the application. The impact of this vulnerability
  includes the potential for stolen credentials, extraction of sensitive information from chat
  logs, projects, and other data accessible through the application.
