aliases: []
summary: Missing input validation in internal/db/repo_editor.go in Gogs before 0.12.8 allows
  an attacker to execute code remotely. An unprivileged attacker (registered user) can overwrite
  the Git configuration in his repository. This leads to Remote Command Execution, because that
  configuration can contain an option such as sshCommand, which is executed when a master branch
  is a remote branch (using an ssh:// URI). The remote branch can also be configured by editing
  the Git configuration file. One can create a new file in a new repository, using the GUI,
  with "\" as its name, and then rename this file to .git/config with the custom configuration
  content (and then save it).
