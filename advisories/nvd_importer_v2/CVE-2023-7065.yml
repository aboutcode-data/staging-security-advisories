aliases: []
summary: The Stop Spammers Security | Block Spam Users, Comments, Forms plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2024.4.
  This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the sfs_process AJAX action. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add arbitrary IPs to the plugin's allowlist
  and blocklist via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
