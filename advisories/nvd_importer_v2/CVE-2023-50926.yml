summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation
  IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an incoming DIO message when using the
  RPL-Lite implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system. More specifically, the prefix
  information of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an IPv6 address
  prefix. The value of this field is not validated, which means that an attacker can set a value
  that is longer than the maximum prefix length. Subsequently, a memcmp function call that compares
  different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses the boundary of the
  array allocated for the prefix, causing an out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched
  in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release.
  Users are advised to update as soon as they are able to or to manually apply the changes in
  Contiki-NG pull request #2721.'
