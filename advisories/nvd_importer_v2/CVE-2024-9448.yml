aliases: []
summary: On affected platforms running Arista EOS with Traffic Policies configured the vulnerability
  will cause received untagged packets not to hit Traffic Policy rules that they are expected
  to hit. If the rule was to drop the packet, the packet will not be dropped and instead will
  be forwarded as if the rule was not in place. This could lead to packets being delivered to
  unexpected destinations.
