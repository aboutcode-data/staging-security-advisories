aliases: []
summary: Umbraco Forms version 4.0.0 up to and including 8.7.5 and below are vulnerable to a
  security flaw that could lead to a remote code execution attack and/or arbitrary file deletion.
  A vulnerability occurs because validation of the file extension is performed after the file
  has been stored in a temporary directory. By default, files are stored within the application
  directory structure at %BASEDIR%/APP_DATA/TEMP/FileUploads/. Whilst access to this directory
  is restricted by the root web.config file, it is possible to override this restriction by
  uploading another specially crafted web.config file to the temporary directory. It is possible
  to exploit this flaw to upload a malicious script file to execute arbitrary code and system
  commands on the server.
