summary: The Library File Manager WordPress plugin before 5.2.3 is using an outdated version
  of the elFinder library, which is know to be affected by security issues (CVE-2021-32682),
  and does not have any authorisation as well as CSRF checks in its connector AJAX action, allowing

  to the elFinder library does not restrict any file type, users with a role as low as subscriber
  can Create/Upload/Delete Arbitrary files and folders.
