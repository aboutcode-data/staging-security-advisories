aliases: []
summary: The My Geo Posts Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'mygeo_city' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the
  plugin not properly sanitizing user input or escaping output of the 'default' shortcode attribute.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
