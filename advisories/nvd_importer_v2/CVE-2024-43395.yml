aliases: []
summary: CraftOS-PC 2 is a rewrite of the desktop port of CraftOS from the popular Minecraft
  mod ComputerCraft using C++ and a modified version of PUC Lua, as well as SDL for drawing.
  Prior to version 2.8.3, users of CraftOS-PC 2 on Windows can escape the computer folder and
  access files anywhere without permission or notice by obfuscating `..`s to bypass the internal
  check preventing parent directory traversal. Version 2.8.3 contains a patch for this issue.
