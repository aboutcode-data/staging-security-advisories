summary: Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Open Solution Quick.Cart 2.0, when
  register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote attackers to include
  and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the config[db_type] parameter to (1)
  categories.php, (2) couriers.php, (3) orders.php, and (4) products.php in actions_admin/;
  and (5) orders.php and (6) products.php in actions_client/; as demonstrated by injecting PHP
  sequences into an Apache HTTP Server log file, which is then included by one of these PHP
  scripts.
