summary: Bifrost is a middleware package which can synchronize MySQL/MariaDB binlog data to
  other types of databases. Versions 1.8.6-release and prior are vulnerable to authentication
  bypass when using HTTP basic authentication. This may allow group members who only have read
  permissions to write requests when they are normally forbidden from doing so. Version 1.8.7-release
  contains a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.
