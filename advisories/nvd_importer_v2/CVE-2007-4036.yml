aliases: []
summary: 'Guidance Software EnCase allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service via (1) a corrupted Microsoft Exchange database, which triggers an application crash
  when many options are selected; (2) a corrupted NTFS filesystem, which causes the application
  to report "memory allocation errors;" or (3) deeply nested directories, which trigger an application
  crash during an Expand All action. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of these vectors
  because the user can select fewer options, there is no operational impact, or the user can
  do less expansion'
