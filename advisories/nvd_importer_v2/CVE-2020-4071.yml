aliases: []
summary: In django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist before 0.3.4, a potential timing attack exists on
  websites where the basic authentication is used or configured, i.e. BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
  is set. Currently the string comparison between configured credentials and the ones provided
  by users is performed through a character-by-character string comparison. This enables a possibility
  that attacker may time the time it takes the server to validate different usernames and password,
  and use this knowledge to work out the valid credentials. This attack is understood not to
  be realistic over the Internet. However, it may be achieved from within local networks where
  the website is hosted, e.g. from inside a data centre where a website's server is located.
  Sites protected by IP address whitelisting only are unaffected by this vulnerability. This
  vulnerability has been fixed on version 0.3.4 of django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist. Update to
  version 0.3.4 as soon as possible and change basic authentication username and password configured
  on a Django project using this package. A workaround without upgrading to version 0.3.4 is
  to stop using basic authentication and use the IP whitelisting component only. It can be achieved
  by not setting BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD in Django project settings.
