aliases: []
summary: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation
  from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity
  hardware. Prior to version 1.10.10, FreeSWITCH allows authorized users to cause a denial of
  service attack by sending re-INVITE with SDP containing duplicate codec names. When a call
  in FreeSWITCH completes codec negotiation, the `codec_string` channel variable is set with
  the result of the negotiation. On a subsequent re-negotiation, if an SDP is offered that contains
  codecs with the same names but with different formats, there may be too many codec matches
  detected by FreeSWITCH leading to overflows of its internal arrays. By abusing this vulnerability,
  an attacker is able to corrupt stack of FreeSWITCH leading to an undefined behavior of the
  system or simply crash it. Version 1.10.10 contains a patch for this issue.
