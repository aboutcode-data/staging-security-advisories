summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe/migrate: prevent infinite recursion

  If the buf + offset is not aligned to XE_CAHELINE_BYTES we fallback to
  using a bounce buffer. However the bounce buffer here is allocated on
  the stack, and the only alignment requirement here is that it's
  naturally aligned to u8, and not XE_CACHELINE_BYTES. If the bounce
  buffer is also misaligned we then recurse back into the function again,
  however the new bounce buffer might also not be aligned, and might never
  be until we eventually blow through the stack, as we keep recursing.

  Instead of using the stack use kmalloc, which should respect the
  power-of-two alignment request here. Fixes a kernel panic when
  triggering this path through eudebug.

  v2 (Stuart):
   - Add build bug check for power-of-two restriction
   - s/EINVAL/ENOMEM/

  (cherry picked from commit 38b34e928a08ba594c4bbf7118aa3aadacd62fff)
