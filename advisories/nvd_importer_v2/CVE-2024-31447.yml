aliases: []
summary: Shopware 6 is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue. Starting
  in version 6.3.5.0 and prior to versions 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8, when a authenticated request
  is made to `POST /store-api/account/logout`, the cart will be cleared, but the User won't
  be logged out. This affects only the direct store-api usage, as the PHP Storefront listens
  additionally on `CustomerLogoutEvent` and invalidates the session additionally. The problem
  has been fixed in Shopware 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8. Those who are unable to update can install
  the latest version of the Shopware Security Plugin as a workaround.
