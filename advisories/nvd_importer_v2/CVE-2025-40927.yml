summary: |
  CGI::Simple versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flaw
  This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.

  Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.



  As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.

  The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

  Impact

  By injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:

    *  Break the current HTTP header
    *  Inject a new header or entire body
    *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response
  That can lead to the following attacks:

    *  reflected XSS
    *  open redirect
    *  cache poisoning
    *  header manipulation
