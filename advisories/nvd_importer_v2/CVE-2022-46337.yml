summary: "A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks. In \nLDAP-authenticated\
  \ Derby installations, this could let an attacker fill \nup the disk by creating junk Derby\
  \ databases. In LDAP-authenticated \nDerby installations, this could also allow the attacker\
  \ to execute \nmalware which was visible to and executable by the account which booted \n\
  the Derby server. In LDAP-protected databases which weren't also \nprotected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE\
  \ authorization, this vulnerability could \nalso let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive\
  \ data and run sensitive \ndatabase functions and procedures.\n\nMitigation:\n\nUsers should\
  \ upgrade to Java 21 and Derby 10.17.1.0.\n\nAlternatively, users who wish to remain on older\
  \ Java versions should \nbuild their own Derby distribution from one of the release families\
  \ to \nwhich the fix was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the \nreleases which\
  \ correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11, \nand 8."
