aliases: []
summary: In all versions prior to version 3.9.6 for eclipse-wtp, all versions prior to version
  9.4.4 for eclipse-cdt, and all versions prior to version 3.0.1 for eclipse-groovy, Spotless
  was resolving dependencies over an insecure channel (http). If the build occurred over an
  insecure connection, a malicious user could have perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during
  the build and alter the build artifacts that were produced. In case that any of these artifacts
  were compromised, any developers using these could be altered. **Note:** In order to validate
  that this artifact was not compromised, the maintainer would need to confirm that none of
  the artifacts published to the registry were not altered with. Until this happens, we can
  not guarantee that this artifact was not compromised even though the probability that this
  happened is low.
