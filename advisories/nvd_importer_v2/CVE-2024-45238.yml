aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends
  from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a resource certificate containing
  a bit string that doesn't properly decode into a Subject Public Key. OpenSSL does not report
  this problem during parsing, and when compiled with OpenSSL libcrypto versions below 3, Fort
  recklessly dereferences the pointer. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can lead
  to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.
