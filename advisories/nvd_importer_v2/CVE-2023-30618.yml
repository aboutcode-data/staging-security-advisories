aliases: []
summary: Kitchen-Terraform provides a set of Test Kitchen plugins which enable the use of Test
  Kitchen to converge a Terraform configuration and verify the resulting infrastructure systems
  with InSpec controls. Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 introduced a regression which caused all Terraform
  output values, including sensitive values, to be printed at the `info` logging level during
  the `kitchen converge` action. Prior to v7.0.0, the output values were printed at the `debug`
  level to avoid writing sensitive values to the terminal by default. An attacker would need
  access to the local machine in order to gain access to these logs during an operation. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
