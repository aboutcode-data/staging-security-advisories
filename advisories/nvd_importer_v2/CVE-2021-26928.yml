summary: 'BIRD through 2.0.7 does not provide functionality for password authentication of BGP
  peers. Because of this, products that use BIRD (which may, for example, include Tigera products
  in some configurations, as well as products of other vendors) may have been susceptible to
  route redirection for Denial of Service and/or Information Disclosure. NOTE: a researcher
  has asserted that the behavior is within Tigera’s area of responsibility; however, Tigera
  disagrees'
