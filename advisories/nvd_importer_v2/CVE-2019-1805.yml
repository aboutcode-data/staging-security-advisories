aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in certain access control mechanisms for the Secure Shell (SSH) server
  implementation for Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  adjacent attacker to access a CLI instance on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
  to a lack of proper input- and validation-checking mechanisms for inbound SSH connections
  on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to establish
  an SSH connection to an affected controller. An exploit could allow the attacker to access
  an affected device's CLI to potentially cause further attacks. This vulnerability has been
  fixed in version 8.5(140.0).
