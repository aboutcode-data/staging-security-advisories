aliases: []
summary: ConnectWise ScreenConnect versions 22.6 and below contained a flaw allowing potential
  brute force attacks on custom access tokens due to inadequate rate-limiting controls in the
  default configuration. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access
  by repeatedly attempting access code combinations. ConnectWise has addressed this issue in
  later versions by implementing rate-limiting controls as a preventive measure against brute
  force attacks.
