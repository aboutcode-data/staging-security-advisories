aliases: []
summary: XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given
  syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 5.4.5
  and prior to version 14.10, the XHTML syntax depended on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax which
  allows the creation of raw blocks that permit the insertion of arbitrary HTML content including
  JavaScript. This allows XSS attacks for users who can edit a document like their user profile
  (enabled by default). This has been fixed in version 14.10 by removing the dependency on the
  `xdom+xml/current` syntax from the XHTML syntax. Note that the `xdom+xml` syntax is still
  vulnerable to this attack. As it's main purpose is testing and its use is quite difficult,
  this syntax shouldn't be installed or used on a regular wiki. There are no known workarounds
  apart from upgrading.
