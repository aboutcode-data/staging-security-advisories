  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpio: mpsse: ensure worker is torn down

  When an IRQ worker is running, unplugging the device would cause a
  crash. The sealevel hardware this driver was written for was not
  hotpluggable, so I never realized it.

  This change uses a spinlock to protect a list of workers, which
  it tears down on disconnect.
