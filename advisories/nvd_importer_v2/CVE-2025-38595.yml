  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen: fix UAF in dmabuf_exp_from_pages()

  [dma_buf_fd() fixes; no preferences regarding the tree it goes through -
  up to xen folks]

  As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
  thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
  returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
  race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
  follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
  destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
  by its ->release()), we have a UAF.

  dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
  gntdev dmabuf_exp_from_pages() calls it and then proceeds to access the
  objects destroyed on close - starting with gntdev_dmabuf itself.

  Fix that by doing reserving descriptor before anything else and do
  fd_install() only when everything had been set up.
