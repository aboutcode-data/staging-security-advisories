aliases: []
summary: changedetection.io is an open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock
  monitor and notification service. There is a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Jinja2
  that allows Remote Command Execution on the server host. Attackers can run any system command
  without any restriction and they could use a reverse shell. The impact is critical as the
  attacker can completely takeover the server machine. This can be reduced if changedetection
  is behind a login page, but this isn't required by the application (not by default and not
  enforced).
