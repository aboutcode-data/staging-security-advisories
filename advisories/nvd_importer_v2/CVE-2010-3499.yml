aliases: []
summary: 'F-Secure Anti-Virus does not properly interact with the processing of hcp:// URLs
  by the Microsoft Help and Support Center, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via malware that is correctly detected by this product, but with a detection
  approach that occurs too late to stop the code execution.  NOTE: the researcher indicates
  that a vendor response was received, stating that "the inability to catch these files are
  caused by lacking functionality rather than programming errors."'
