aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the authentication and authorization checking mechanisms of Cisco
  Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to
  gain network access to a Cisco TrustSec domain. Under normal circumstances, this access should
  be prohibited. The vulnerability is due to the dynamic assignment of Security Group Tags (SGTs)
  during a wireless roam from one Service Set Identifier (SSID) to another within the Cisco
  TrustSec domain. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to acquire an
  SGT from other SSIDs within the domain. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to
  gain privileged network access that should be prohibited under normal circumstances.
