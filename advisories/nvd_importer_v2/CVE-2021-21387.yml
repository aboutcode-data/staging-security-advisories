summary: Wrongthink peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted messenger with PeerJS and Axolotl ratchet.
  In wrongthink from version 2.0.0 and before 2.3.0 there was a set of vulnerabilities causing
  inadequate encryption strength. Part of the secret identity key was disclosed by the fingerprint
  used for connection. Additionally, the safety number was improperly calculated. It was computed
  using part of one of the public identity keys instead of being derived from both public identity
  keys. This caused issues in computing safety numbers which would potentially be exploitable
  in the real world. Additionally there was inadequate encryption strength due to use of 1024-bit
  DSA keys. These issues are all fixed in version 2.3.0.
