summary: The WooCommerce HSS Extension for Streaming Video plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘videolink’ parameter in all versions up to, and

  possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute
  if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
