  staging: greybus: audio_helper: remove unused and wrong debugfs usage

  In the greybus audio_helper code, the debugfs file for the dapm has the
  potential to be removed and memory will be leaked.  There is also the
  very real potential for this code to remove ALL debugfs entries from the
  system, and it seems like this is what will really happen if this code
  ever runs.  This all is very wrong as the greybus audio driver did not
  create this debugfs file, the sound core did and controls the lifespan
  of it.

  So remove all of the debugfs logic from the audio_helper code as there's
  no way it could be correct.  If this really is needed, it can come back
  with a fixup for the incorrect usage of the debugfs_lookup() call which
  is what caused this to be noticed at all.
