aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. A Bypass of Two-Factor
  Authentication can occur under the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. Because only
  the client-side verifies whether a check was successful, an attacker can modify the response,
  and fool the application into concluding that the TOTP was correct.
