aliases: []
summary: In XE 1.116, when uploading the Normal button, there is no restriction on the file
  suffix, which leads to any file uploading to the files directory. Since .htaccess only restricts
  the PHP type, uploading HTML-type files leads to stored XSS vulnerabilities. If the .htaccess
  configuration is improper, for example before the XE 1.11.2 version, you can upload the PHP
  type file to GETSHELL.
