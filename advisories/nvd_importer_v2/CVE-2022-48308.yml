summary: It was discovered that the sls-logging was not verifying hostnames in TLS certificates
  due to a misuse of the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory API. A malicious attacker in a privileged
  network position could abuse this to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. A successful man-in-the-middle
  attack would allow them to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the
  affected service.
