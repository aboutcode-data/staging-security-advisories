aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in savignano S/Notify before 4.0.2 for Jira. While an administrative
  user is logged on, the configuration settings of S/Notify can be modified via a CSRF attack.
  The injection could be initiated by the administrator clicking a malicious link in an email
  or by visiting a malicious website. If executed while an administrator is logged on to Jira,
  an attacker could exploit this to modify the configuration of the S/Notify app on that host.
  This can, in particular, lead to email notifications being no longer encrypted when they should
  be.
