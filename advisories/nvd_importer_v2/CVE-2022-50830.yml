  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  auxdisplay: hd44780: Fix potential memory leak in hd44780_remove()

  hd44780_probe() allocates a memory chunk for hd with kzalloc() and
  makes "lcd->drvdata->hd44780" point to it. When we call hd44780_remove(),
  we should release all relevant memory and resource. But "lcd->drvdata
  ->hd44780" is not released, which will lead to a memory leak.

  We should release the "lcd->drvdata->hd44780" in hd44780_remove() to fix
  the memory leak bug.
