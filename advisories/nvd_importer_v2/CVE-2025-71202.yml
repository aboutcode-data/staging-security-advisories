  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommu/sva: invalidate stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space

  Introduce a new IOMMU interface to flush IOTLB paging cache entries for
  the CPU kernel address space.  This interface is invoked from the x86
  architecture code that manages combined user and kernel page tables,
  specifically before any kernel page table page is freed and reused.

  This addresses the main issue with vfree() which is a common occurrence
  and can be triggered by unprivileged users.  While this resolves the
  primary problem, it doesn't address some extremely rare case related to
  memory unplug of memory that was present as reserved memory at boot, which
  cannot be triggered by unprivileged users.  The discussion can be found at
  the link below.

  Enable SVA on x86 architecture since the IOMMU can now receive
  notification to flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page
  table pages.
