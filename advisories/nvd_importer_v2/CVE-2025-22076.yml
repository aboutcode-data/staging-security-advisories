  exfat: fix missing shutdown check

  xfstests generic/730 test failed because after deleting the device
  that still had dirty data, the file could still be read without
  returning an error. The reason is the missing shutdown check in
  ->read_iter.

  I also noticed that shutdown checks were missing from ->write_iter,
  ->splice_read, and ->mmap. This commit adds shutdown checks to all
  of them.
