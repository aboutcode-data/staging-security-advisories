aliases: []
summary: Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. The implemented Flow Builder functionality
  in the Shopware application does not adequately validate the URL used when creating the “call
  webhook” action. This enables malicious users to perform web requests to internal hosts. This
  issue has been fixed in the Commercial Plugin release 6.5.7.4 or with the Security Plugin.
  For installations with Shopware 6.4 the Security plugin is recommended to be installed and
  up to date. For older versions of 6.4 and 6.5 corresponding security measures are also available
  via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware
  version.
