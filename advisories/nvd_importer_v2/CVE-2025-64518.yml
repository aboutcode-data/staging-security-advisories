aliases: []
summary: The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities
  to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior
  to version 11.0.1, the XML `Validator` used by cyclonedx-core-java was not configured securely,
  making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The fix for GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8
  / CVE-2024-38374 was incomplete in that it only fixed parsing of XML BOMs, but not validation.
  The vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 11.0.1. As a workaround, applications
  can reject XML documents before handing them to cyclonedx-core-java for validation. This may
  be an option if incoming CycloneDX BOMs are known to be in JSON format.
