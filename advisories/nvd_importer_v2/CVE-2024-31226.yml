aliases: []
summary: Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Users who ran Sunshine versions
  0.17.0 through 0.22.2 as a service on Windows may be impacted when terminating the service
  if an attacked placed a file named `C:\Program.exe`, `C:\Program.bat`, or `C:\Program.cmd`
  on the user's computer. This attack vector isn't exploitable unless the user has manually
  loosened ACLs on the system drive. If the user's system locale is not English, then the name
  of the executable will likely vary. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue. Some workarounds
  are available. One may identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception
  by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker,
  or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate. Alternatively, ensure that proper permissions
  and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write files to the top-level
  directory `C:`. Require that all executables be placed in write-protected directories.
