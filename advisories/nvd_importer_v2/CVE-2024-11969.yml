summary: The NetCloud Exchange client for Windows, version 1.110.50, contains an insecure file
  and folder permissions vulnerability. A normal (non-admin) user could exploit the weakness
  in file and folder permissions to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code and maintain
  persistence on the compromised machine. It has been identified that full control permissions
  exist on the ‘Everyone’ group (i.e. any user who has local access to the operating system
  regardless of their privileges).
