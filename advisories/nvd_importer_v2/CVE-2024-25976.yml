aliases: []
summary: When LDAP authentication is activated in the configuration it is possible to obtain
  reflected XSS execution by creating a custom URL that the victim only needs to open in order
  to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This is due to a fault in the
  file login.php where the content of "$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']" is reflected into the HTML of the
  website. Hence the attacker does not need a valid account in order to exploit this issue.
