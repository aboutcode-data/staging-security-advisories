aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of
  data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations
  in code. The Fides Privacy Center allows data subject users to submit privacy and consent
  requests to data controller users of the Fides web application. Privacy requests allow data
  subjects to submit a request to access all person data held by the data controller, or delete/erase
  it.  Consent request allows data subject users to modify their privacy preferences for how
  the data controller uses their personal data e.g. data sales and sharing consent opt-in/opt-out.
  If `subject_identity_verification_required` in the `[execution]` section of `fides.toml` or
  the env var `FIDES__EXECUTION__SUBJECT_IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` is set to `True` on
  the fides webserver backend, data subjects are sent a one-time code to their email address
  or phone number, depending on messaging configuration, and the one-time code must be entered
  in the Privacy Center UI by the data subject before the privacy or consent request is submitted.
  It was identified that the one-time code values for these requests were generated by the python
  `random` module, a cryptographically weak pseduo-random number generator (PNRG). If an attacker
  generates several hundred consecutive one-time codes, this vulnerability allows the attacker
  to predict all future one-time code values during the lifetime of the backend python process.
  There is no security impact on data access requests as the personal data download package
  is not shared in the Privacy Center itself. However, this vulnerability allows an attacker
  to (i) submit a verified data erasure request, resulting in deletion of data for the targeted
  user and (ii) submit a verified consent request, modifying a user's privacy preferences. The
  vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.24.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to
  this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
