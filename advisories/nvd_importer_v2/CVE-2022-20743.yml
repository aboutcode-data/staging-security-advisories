summary: A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center
  (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass security protections
  and upload malicious files to the affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper validation
  of files uploaded to the web management interface of Cisco FMC Software. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by uploading a maliciously crafted file to a device running affected

  which they could access later to conduct additional attacks, including executing arbitrary
  code on the affected device with root privileges.
