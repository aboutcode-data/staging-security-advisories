aliases: []
summary: When incoming DNS over HTTPS support is enabled using the nghttp2 provider, and queries
  are routed to a tcp-only or DNS over TLS backend, an attacker can trigger an assertion failure
  in DNSdist by sending a request for a zone transfer (AXFR or IXFR) over DNS over HTTPS, causing
  the process to stop and thus leading to a Denial of Service. DNS over HTTPS is not enabled
  by default, and backends are using plain DNS (Do53) by default.
