summary: AliasVault is a privacy-first password manager with built-in email aliasing. AliasVault
  Android versions 0.24.0 through 0.25.2 contained an issue in how passkey requests from Android
  apps were validated. Under certain local conditions, a malicious app could attempt to obtain
  a passkey response for a site it was not authorized to access. The issue involved incomplete
  validation of calling app identity, origin, and RP ID in the Android credential provider.
  This issue was fixed in AliasVault Android 0.25.3.
