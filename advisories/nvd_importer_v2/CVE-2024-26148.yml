aliases: []
summary: Querybook is a user interface for querying big data. Prior to version 3.31.1, there
  is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs
  without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:`
  protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit
  of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL,
  thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify
  this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible
  and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue,
  except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.
