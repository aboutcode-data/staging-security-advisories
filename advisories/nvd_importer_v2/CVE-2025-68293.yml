  mm/huge_memory: fix NULL pointer deference when splitting folio

  Commit c010d47f107f ("mm: thp: split huge page to any lower order pages")
  introduced an early check on the folio's order via mapping->flags before
  proceeding with the split work.

  This check introduced a bug: for shmem folios in the swap cache and
  truncated folios, the mapping pointer can be NULL.  Accessing
  mapping->flags in this state leads directly to a NULL pointer dereference.

  This commit fixes the issue by moving the check for mapping != NULL before
  any attempt to access mapping->flags.
