aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine
  (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because
  the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a
  crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code
  in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
