datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24299
aliases: []
summary: The ReDi Restaurant Reservation WordPress plugin before 21.0426 provides the functionality
  to let users make restaurant reservations. These reservations are stored and can be listed
  on an 'Upcoming' page provided by the plugin. An unauthenticated user can fill in the form
  to make a restaurant reservation. The form to make a restaurant reservation field called 'Comment'
  does not use proper input validation and can be used to store XSS payloads. The XSS payloads
  will be executed when the plugin user goes to the 'Upcoming' page, which is an external website
  https://upcoming.reservationdiary.eu/ loaded in an iframe, and the stored reservation with
  XSS payload is loaded.
