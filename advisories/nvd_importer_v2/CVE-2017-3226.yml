aliases: []
summary: Das U-Boot is a device bootloader that can read its configuration from an AES encrypted
  file. Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption
  (i.e., setting the configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables from
  disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical access to the device
  can manipulate the encrypted environment data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which
  triggers an error in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled
  by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.
