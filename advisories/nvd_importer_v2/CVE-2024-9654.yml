aliases: []
summary: The Easy Digital Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Authorization
  in versions 3.1 through 3.3.4. This is due to a lack of sufficient validation checks within
  the 'verify_guest_email' function to ensure the requesting user is the intended recipient
  of the purchase receipt. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass intended
  security restrictions and view the receipts of other users, which contains a link to download
  paid content. Successful exploitation requires knowledge of another customers email address
  as well as the file ID of the content they purchased.
