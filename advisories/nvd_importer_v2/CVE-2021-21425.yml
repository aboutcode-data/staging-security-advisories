aliases: []
summary: Grav Admin Plugin is an HTML user interface that provides a way to configure Grav and
  create and modify pages. In versions 1.10.7 and earlier, an unauthenticated user can execute
  some methods of administrator controller without needing any credentials. Particular method
  execution will result in arbitrary YAML file creation or content change of existing YAML files
  on the system. Successfully exploitation of that vulnerability results in configuration changes,
  such as general site information change, custom scheduler job definition, etc. Due to the
  nature of the vulnerability, an adversary can change some part of the webpage, or hijack an
  administrator account, or execute operating system command under the context of the web-server
  user. This vulnerability is fixed in version 1.10.8. Blocking access to the `/admin` path
  from untrusted sources can be applied as a workaround.
