aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud OfficeOnline
  application prior to version 1.1.1 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This
  could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the
  file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`). It
  is recommended that the OfficeOnline application is upgraded to 1.1.1. As a workaround, one
  may disable the OfficeOnline application in the app settings.
