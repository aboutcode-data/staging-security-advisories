summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: rsi: Do not configure WoWlan in shutdown hook if not enabled

  In case WoWlan was never configured during the operation of the system,
  the hw->wiphy->wowlan_config will be NULL. rsi_config_wowlan() checks
  whether wowlan_config is non-NULL and if it is not, then WARNs about it.
  The warning is valid, as during normal operation the rsi_config_wowlan()
  should only ever be called with non-NULL wowlan_config. In shutdown this
  rsi_config_wowlan() should only ever be called if WoWlan was configured
  before by the user.

  Add checks for non-NULL wowlan_config into the shutdown hook. While at it,
  check whether the wiphy is also non-NULL before accessing wowlan_config .
  Drop the single-use wowlan_config variable, just inline it into function
  call.
