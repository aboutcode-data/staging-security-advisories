aliases: []
summary: OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.1 contain a vulnerability that allows
  any unauthenticated attacker to send a manipulated broken multipart/form-data request to OctoPrint
  and through that make the web server component become unresponsive. The issue can be triggered
  by a broken multipart/form-data request lacking an end boundary to any of OctoPrint's endpoints
  implemented through the octoprint.server.util.tornado.UploadStorageFallbackHandler request
  handler. The request handler will get stuck in an endless busy loop, looking for a part of
  the request that will never come. As Tornado is single-threaded, that will effectively block
  the whole web server. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.11.2.
