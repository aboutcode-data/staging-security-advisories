  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smb: client: fix wrong index reference in smb2_compound_op()

  In smb2_compound_op(), the loop that processes each command's response
  uses wrong indices when accessing response bufferes.

  This incorrect indexing leads to improper handling of command results.
  Also, if incorrectly computed index is greather than or equal to
  MAX_COMPOUND, it can cause out-of-bounds accesses.
