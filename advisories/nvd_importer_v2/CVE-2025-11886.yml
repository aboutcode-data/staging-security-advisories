summary: The CTL Arcade Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'ctl_arcade_lite_page_manage_games' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to deactivate and activate arbitrary plugins via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
