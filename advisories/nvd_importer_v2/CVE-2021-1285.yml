summary: "Multiple Cisco&nbsp;products are affected by a vulnerability in the Ethernet Frame\
  \ Decoder of the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker\
  \ to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling\
  \ of error conditions when processing Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending malicious Ethernet frames through an affected device. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to exhaust disk space on the affected device, which could result in administrators\
  \ being unable to log in to the device or the device being unable to boot up correctly.Note:\
  \ Manual intervention is required to recover from this situation. Customers are advised to\
  \ contact the Cisco&nbsp;Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help recover a device in this\
  \ condition.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There\
  \ are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
