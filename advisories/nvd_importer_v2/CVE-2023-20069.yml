aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure
  and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote
  attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface
  on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface
  to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access
  the web-based management interface of the affected device.
