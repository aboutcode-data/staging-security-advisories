summary: Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.4.13, there
  exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active
  exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to
  a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any
  potential abuse. If one has a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request
  header, then sending a request with a certain Connection header will cause it to be removed
  before the request is sent. In this case, the backend does not see the request header. A patch
  is available in version 2.4.13. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
