aliases: []
summary: WWBN AVideo is an open source video platform. In AVideo prior to version 12.4, a normal
  user can make a Meeting Schedule where the user can invite another user in that Meeting, but
  it does not properly sanitize the malicious characters when creating a Meeting Room. This
  allows attacker to insert malicious scripts. Since any USER including the ADMIN can see the
  meeting room that was created by the attacker this can lead to cookie hijacking and takeover
  of any accounts. Version 12.4 contains a patch for this issue.
