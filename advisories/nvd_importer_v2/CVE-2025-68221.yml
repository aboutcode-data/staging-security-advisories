  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mptcp: fix address removal logic in mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr

  removal counter updates. The current code only executes decrement
  logic when the counter is already 0 (abnormal state), while
  normal removals (counter > 0) are ignored.
