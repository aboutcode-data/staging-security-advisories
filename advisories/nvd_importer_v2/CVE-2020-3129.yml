summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management
  interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted data to a specific
  field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store an XSS
  attack within the interface. This stored XSS attack would then be executed on the system of
  any user viewing the attacker-supplied data element.
