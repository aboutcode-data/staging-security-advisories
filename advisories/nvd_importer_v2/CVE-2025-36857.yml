summary: |
  Rapid7 Appspider Pro versions below 7.5.021, suffer from a broken access control vulnerability in the application's configuration file loading mechanism, whereby an attacker can place files in directories belonging to other users or projects. Affected versions allow standard users to add custom configuration files. These files, which are loaded in alphabetical order, can override or change the settings of the original configuration files, creating a security vulnerability. This issue stems from improper directory access management.

  This vulnerability was remediated in version 7.5.021 of the product.
