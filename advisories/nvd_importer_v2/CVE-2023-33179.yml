summary: Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered
  starting in version 3.2.0 and prior to version 3.3.5 in the `nameFilter` function used throughout
  the CMS. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting
  specially crafted values for logical operators. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.5 which
  fixes this issue. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
