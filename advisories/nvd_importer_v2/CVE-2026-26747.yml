aliases: []
summary: A Host Header Poisoning vulnerability exists in Monica 4.1.2 due to improper handling
  of the HTTP Host header in app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php, combined with the default
  misconfiguration where the "app.force_url" is not set and default is "false". The application
  generates absolute URLs (such as those used in password reset emails) using the user-supplied
  Host header. This allows remote attackers to poison the password reset link sent to a victim,
