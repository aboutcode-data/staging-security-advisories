aliases: []
summary: The Basil recipe theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS) via the `post_title` parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.0.4 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers
  with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses a compromised page. Because the of the default WordPress
  validation, it is not possible to insert the payload directly but if the Cooked plugin is
  installed, it is possible to create a recipe post type (cp_recipe) and inject the payload
  in the title field. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch for the issue.
