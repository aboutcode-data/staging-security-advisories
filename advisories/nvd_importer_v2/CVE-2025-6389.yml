aliases: []
summary: The Sneeit Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in
  all versions up to, and including, 8.3 via the sneeit_articles_pagination_callback() function.
  This is due to the function accepting user input and then passing that through call_user_func().
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server which can
  be leveraged to inject backdoors or, for example, create new administrative user accounts.
