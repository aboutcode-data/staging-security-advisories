aliases: []
summary: BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. In versions 3.0.21 and below, the
  official documentation for "Server Customization" on Support for ClamAV as presentation file
  scanner contains instructions that leave a BBB server vulnerable for Denial of Service. The
  flawed command exposes both ports (3310 and 7357) to the internet. A remote attacker can use
  this to send complex or large documents to clamd and waste server resources, or shutdown the
  clamd process. The clamd documentation explicitly warns about exposing this port. Enabling
  ufw (ubuntu firewall) during install does not help, because Docker routes container traffic
  through the nat table, which is not managed or restricted by ufw. Rules installed by ufw in
  the filter table have no effect on docker traffic. In addition, the provided example also
  mounts /var/bigbluebutton with write permissions into the container, which should not be required.
  Future vulnerabilities in clamd may allow attackers to manipulate files in that folder. Users
  are unaffected unless they have opted in to follow the extra instructions from BigBlueButton's
  documentation. This issue has been fixed in version 3.0.22.
