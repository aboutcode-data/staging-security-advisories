aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: iaa - Fix out-of-bounds index in find_empty_iaa_compression_mode

  The local variable 'i' is initialized with -EINVAL, but the for loop
  immediately overwrites it and -EINVAL is never returned.

  If no empty compression mode can be found, the function would return the
  out-of-bounds index IAA_COMP_MODES_MAX, which would cause an invalid
  array access in add_iaa_compression_mode().

  Fix both issues by returning either a valid index or -EINVAL.
