aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Zeroheight (SaaS) prior to 2025-06-13. A legacy user creation
  API pathway allowed accounts to be created without completing the intended email verification
  step. While unverified accounts could not access product functionality, the behavior bypassed
  intended verification controls and allowed unintended account creation. This could have enabled
  spam/fake account creation or resource usage impact. No data exposure or unauthorized access
  to existing accounts was reported.
