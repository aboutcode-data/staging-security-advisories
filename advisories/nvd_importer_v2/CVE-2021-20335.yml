aliases: []
summary: For MongoDB Ops Manager versions prior to and including 4.2.24 with multiple OM application
  servers, that have SSL turned on for their MongoDB processes, the upgrade to MongoDB Ops Manager
  versions prior to and including 4.4.12 triggers a bug where Automation thinks SSL is being
  turned off, and can disable SSL temporarily for members of the cluster. This issue is temporary
  and eventually corrects itself after MongoDB Ops Manager instances have finished upgrading
  to MongoDB Ops Manager 4.4. In addition, customers must be running with clientCertificateMode=OPTIONAL
  / allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates=true to be impacted*.* Customers upgrading from Ops
  Manager 4.2.X to 4.2.24 and finally to Ops Manager 4.4.13+ are unaffected by this issue.
