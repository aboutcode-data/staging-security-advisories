  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rcu: Fix buffer overflow in print_cpu_stall_info()

  The rcuc-starvation output from print_cpu_stall_info() might overflow the
  buffer if there is a huge difference in jiffies difference.  The situation
  might seem improbable, but computers sometimes get very confused about
  time, which can result in full-sized integers, and, in this case,
  buffer overflow.

  Also, the unsigned jiffies difference is printed using %ld, which is
  normally for signed integers.  This is intentional for debugging purposes,
  but it is not obvious from the code.

  This commit therefore changes sprintf() to snprintf() and adds a
  clarifying comment about intention of %ld format.

  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.
