aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  Keras pooling layers can trigger a segfault if the size of the pool is 0 or if a dimension
  is negative. This is due to the TensorFlow's implementation of pooling operations where the
  values in the sliding window are not checked to be strictly positive. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2,
  and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
