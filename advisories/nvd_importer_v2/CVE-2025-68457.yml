aliases: []
summary: Orejime is a consent manager that focuses on accessibility. On HTML elements handled
  by Orejime prior to version 2.3.2, one could run malicious code by embedding `javascript:`
  code within data attributes. When consenting to the related purpose, Orejime would turn data
  attributes into unprefixed ones (i.e. `data-href` into `href`), thus executing the code. This
  shouldn't have any impact on most setups, as elements handled by Orejime are generally hardcoded.
  The problem would only arise if somebody could inject HTML code within pages. The problem
  has been patched in version 2.3.2. As a workaround, the problem can be fixed outside of Orejime
  by sanitizing attributes which could contain executable code.
