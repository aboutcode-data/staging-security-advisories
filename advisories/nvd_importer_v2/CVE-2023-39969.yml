aliases: []
summary: uthenticode is a small cross-platform library for partially verifying Authenticode
  digital signatures. Version 1.0.9 of uthenticode hashed the entire file rather than hashing
  sections by virtual address, in violation of the Authenticode specification. As a result,
  an attacker could modify code within a binary without changing its Authenticode hash, making
  it appear valid from uthenticode's perspective. Versions of uthenticode prior to 1.0.9 are
  not vulnerable to this attack, nor are versions in the 2.x series. By design, uthenticode
  does not perform full-chain validation. However, the malleability of signature verification
  introduced in 1.0.9 was an unintended oversight. The 2.x series addresses the vulnerability.
  Versions prior to 1.0.9 are also not vulnerable, but users are encouraged to upgrade rather
  than downgrade. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability.
