  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  i2c: cadence: cdns_i2c_master_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path

  The cdns_i2c_master_xfer() function gets a runtime PM reference when the
  function is entered. This reference is released when the function is
  exited. There is currently one error path where the function exits
  directly, which leads to a leak of the runtime PM reference.

  Make sure that this error path also releases the runtime PM reference.
