aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: atmel-quadspi: Free resources even if runtime resume failed in .remove()

  An early error exit in atmel_qspi_remove() doesn't prevent the device
  unbind. So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent
  and unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).
  So using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.

  Instead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware
  access and clk disable.

  Also add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.
  The latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by
  the spi core.
