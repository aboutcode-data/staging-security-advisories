summary: Velocidex WinPmem versions 4.1 and below suffer from an Improper Input Validation vulnerability
  whereby an attacker with admin access can trigger a BSOD with a parallel thread changing the
  memory’s access right under the control of the user-mode application. This is due to verification
  only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing the userspace to change page
  permissions half way through the routine.  A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized
  loading of winpmem outside incident response operations.
