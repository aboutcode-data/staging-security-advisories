aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected system. The vulnerabilities
  exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied
  input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface
  to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
