summary: "An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can \nescalate his Windows\
  \ user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by \nexploiting a command injection vulnerability\
  \ in the Elefant Update \nService. The command injection can be exploited by communicating\
  \ with \nthe Elefant Update Service which is running as \"SYSTEM\" via Windows \nNamed Pipes.The\
  \ Elefant Software Updater (ESU) consists of two components. An ESU\n service which runs as\
  \ \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" and an ESU tray client \nwhich communicates with the service to\
  \ update or repair the installation\n and is running with user permissions. The communication\
  \ is implemented \nusing named pipes. A crafted message of type \n\"MessageType.SupportServiceInfos\"\
  \ can be sent to the local ESU service \nto inject commands, which are then executed as \"\
  NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"."
