aliases: []
summary: 'A reflected XSS vulnerability has been discovered in the publicly accessible afr.php
  delivery script of Revive Adserver <= 5.0.3 by Jacopo Tediosi. There are currently no known
  exploits: the session identifier cannot be accessed as it is stored in an http-only cookie
  as of v3.2.2. On older versions, however, under specific circumstances, it could be possible
  to steal the session identifier and gain access to the admin interface. The query string sent
  to the www/delivery/afr.php script was printed back without proper escaping in a JavaScript
  context, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JS code on the browser of the victim.'
