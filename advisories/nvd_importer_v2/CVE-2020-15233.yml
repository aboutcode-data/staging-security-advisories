aliases: []
summary: ORY Fosite is a security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go. In Fosite
  from version 0.30.2 and before version 0.34.1, there is an issue in which an an attacker can
  override the registered redirect URL by performing an OAuth flow and requesting a redirect
  URL that is to the loopback adapter. Attackers can provide both custom URL query parameters

  over the loopback interface. This vulnerability has been patched in ORY Fosite v0.34.1.
