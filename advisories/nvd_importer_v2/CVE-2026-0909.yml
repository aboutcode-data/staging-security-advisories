aliases: []
summary: The WP ULike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.3.1. This is due to the `wp_ulike_delete_history_api`
  AJAX action not verifying that the log entry being deleted belongs to the current user. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above (granted
  the 'stats' capability is assigned to their role), to delete arbitrary log entries belonging
  to other users via the 'id' parameter.
