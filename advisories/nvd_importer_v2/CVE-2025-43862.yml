aliases: []
summary: Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a normal
  user is able to access and modify APP orchestration, even though the web UI of APP orchestration
  is not presented for a normal user. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make
  unauthorized access and changes on the APPSs. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12.
  A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the the access control mechanisms to
  enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC)
  to ensure that only users with admin privileges can access Orchestration of the APPs.
