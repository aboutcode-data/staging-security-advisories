aliases: []
summary: The JetBackup – WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  unauthorized back-up location changes in versions up to, and including 1.4.1 due to a lack
  of proper capability checking on the backup_guard_cloud_dropbox, backup_guard_cloud_gdrive,
  and backup_guard_cloud_oneDrive functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber to change to location of back-ups and potentially
  steal sensitive information from them.
