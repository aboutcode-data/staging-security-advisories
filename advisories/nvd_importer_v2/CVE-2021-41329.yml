summary: Datalust Seq before 2021.2.6259 allows users (with view filters applied to their accounts)
  to see query results not constrained by their view filter. This information exposure, caused
  by an internal cache key collision, occurs when the user's view filter includes an array or
  IN clause, and when another user has recently executed an identical query differing only by
  the array elements.
