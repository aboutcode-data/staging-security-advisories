  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix memory leak when showing current settings

  When retriving a item string with tlmi_setting(), the result has to be
  freed using kfree(). In current_value_show() however, malformed
  item strings are not freed, causing a memory leak.
  Fix this by eliminating the early return responsible for this.
