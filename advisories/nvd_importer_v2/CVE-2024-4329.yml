summary: The Thim Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.9 due to insufficient input

  contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page.
