aliases: []
summary: Seerr is an open-source media request and discovery manager for Jellyfin, Plex, and
  Emby. Prior to version 3.1.0, the `GET /api/v1/user/:id` endpoint returns the full settings
  object for any user, including Pushover, Pushbullet, and Telegram credentials, to any authenticated
  requester regardless of their privilege level. This vulnerability can be exploited alone or
  combined with the reported unauthenticated account creation vulnerability, CVE-2026-27707.
  When combined, the two vulnerabilities create a zero-prior-access chain that leaks third-party
  API credentials for all users, including administrators. Version 3.1.0 contains a fix for
  both this vulnerability and for CVE-2026-27707.
