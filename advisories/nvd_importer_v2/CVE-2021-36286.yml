aliases: []
summary: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0
  contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows
  feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged)
  user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate
  privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point
  allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction
  points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows
  nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which
  can be accessed only by the admin.
