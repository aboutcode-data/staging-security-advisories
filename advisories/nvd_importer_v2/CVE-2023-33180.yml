aliases: []
summary: Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered
  starting in version 3.2.0 and prior to version 3.3.2 in the `/display/map` API route inside
  the CMS. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting
  specially crafted values in to the `bounds` parameter. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.5,
  which fixes this issue. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
