summary: "The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource\
  \ or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This allows attackers\
  \ to bypass intended access restrictions. (CWE-863) \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHitachi Vantara\
  \ Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.0 and 9.3.0.9, including 8.3.x,\
  \ have modules enabled by default that allow execution of system level processes. \n\n\n\n\
   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen access control checks are incorrectly applied, users can access data\
  \ or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range\
  \ of problems, including information exposures and denial of service."
