aliases: []
summary: toy-blog is a headless content management system implementation. Starting in version
  0.4.3 and prior to version 0.5.0, the administrative password was leaked through the command
  line parameter. The problem was patched in version 0.5.0. As a workaround, pass `--read-bearer-token-from-stdin`
  to the launch arguments and feed the token from the standard input in version 0.4.14 or later.
  Earlier versions do not have this workaround.
