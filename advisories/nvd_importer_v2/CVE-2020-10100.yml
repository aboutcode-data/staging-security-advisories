aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Zammad 3.0 through 3.2. It allows for users to view ticket
  customer details associated with specific customers. However, the application does not properly
  implement access controls related to this functionality. As such, users of one company are
  able to access ticket data from other companies. Due to the multi-tenant nature of this application,
  users who can access ticket details from one organization to the next allows for users to
  exfiltrate potentially sensitive data of other companies.
