aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible for a user to write a script in which
  any velocity content is executed with the right of any other document content author. Since
  this API require programming right and the user does not have it, the expected result is `$doc.document.authors.contentAuthor`
  (not executed script), unfortunately with the security vulnerability it is possible for the
  attacker to get `XWiki.superadmin` which shows that the title was executed with the right
  of the unmodified document. This has been patched in XWiki versions 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
