aliases: []
summary: MLFlow versions up to and including 3.4.0 are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks due
  to a lack of Origin header validation in the MLFlow REST server. This vulnerability allows
  malicious websites to bypass Same-Origin Policy protections and execute unauthorized calls
  against REST endpoints. An attacker can query, update, and delete experiments via the affected
  endpoints, leading to potential data exfiltration, destruction, or manipulation. The issue
  is resolved in version 3.5.0.
