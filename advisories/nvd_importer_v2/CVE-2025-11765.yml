aliases: []
summary: The Stock Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the 'image_height' and 'image_width' shortcode attributes in all versions up to, and including,
  1.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
