aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco DNA Spaces Connector could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to perform a command injection attack on an affected device. These vulnerabilities
  are due to insufficient input sanitization when executing affected commands. A high-privileged
  attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities on a Cisco DNA Spaces Connector by injecting
  crafted input during command execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary commands as root within the Connector docker container.
