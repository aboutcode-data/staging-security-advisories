summary: "A vulnerability in the HTTP API subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a remote\
  \ attacker to inject commands that will execute with root privileges into the underlying operating\
  \ system.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker with\
  \ administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected\
  \ system and performing an API call with crafted input. Alternatively, an unauthenticated\
  \ attacker could persuade a legitimate user with administrative privileges who is currently\
  \ logged in to the system to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary commands as the root user."
