  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()

  The variable codec->regmap is often protected by the lock
  codec->regmap_lock when is accessed. However, it is accessed without
  holding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():

    if (codec->regmap)

  In my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is
  set to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer
  dereference can occur in the called function regcache_sync():

    map->lock(map->lock_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c

  To fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the
  mutex_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the
  function call to regcache_sync().

  [ Note: the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current
    codec driver implementations, as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for
    PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.
    But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it's merged
    as is -- tiwai ]
