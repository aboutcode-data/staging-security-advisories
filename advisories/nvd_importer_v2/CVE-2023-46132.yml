aliases: []
summary: Hyperledger Fabric is an open source permissioned distributed ledger framework. Combining
  two molecules to one another, called "cross-linking" results in a molecule with a chemical
  formula that is composed of all atoms of the original two molecules. In Fabric, one can take
  a block of transactions and cross-link the transactions in a way that alters the way the peers
  parse the transactions. If a first peer receives a block B and a second peer receives a block
  identical to B but with the transactions being cross-linked, the second peer will parse transactions
  in a different way and thus its world state will deviate from the first peer. Orderers or
  peers cannot detect that a block has its transactions cross-linked, because there is a vulnerability
  in the way Fabric hashes the transactions of blocks. It simply and naively concatenates them,
  which is insecure and lets an adversary craft a "cross-linked block" (block with cross-linked
  transactions) which alters the way peers process transactions. For example, it is possible
  to select a transaction and manipulate a peer to completely avoid processing it, without changing
  the computed hash of the block. Additional validations have been added in v2.2.14 and v2.5.5
  to detect potential cross-linking issues before processing blocks. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
