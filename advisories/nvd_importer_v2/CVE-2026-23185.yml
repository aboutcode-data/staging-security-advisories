aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: iwlwifi: mld: cancel mlo_scan_start_wk

  mlo_scan_start_wk is not canceled on disconnection. In fact, it is not
  canceled anywhere except in the restart cleanup, where we don't really
  have to.

  This can cause an init-after-queue issue: if, for example, the work was
  queued and then drv_change_interface got executed.

  This can also cause use-after-free: if the work is executed after the
  vif is freed.
