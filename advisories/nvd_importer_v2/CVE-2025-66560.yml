aliases: []
summary: Quarkus is a Cloud Native, (Linux) Container First framework for writing Java applications.
  Prior to versions 3.31.0, 3.27.2, and 3.20.5, a vulnerability exists in the HTTP layer of
  Quarkus REST related to response handling. When a response is being written, the framework
  waits for previously written response chunks to be fully transmitted before proceeding. If
  the client connection is dropped during this waiting period, the associated worker thread
  is never released and becomes permanently blocked. Under sustained or repeated occurrences,
  this can exhaust the available worker threads, leading to degraded performance, or complete
  unavailability of the application. This issue has been patched in versions 3.31.0, 3.27.2,
  and 3.20.5. A workaround involves implementing a health check that monitors the status and
  saturation of the worker thread pool to detect abnormal thread retention early.
