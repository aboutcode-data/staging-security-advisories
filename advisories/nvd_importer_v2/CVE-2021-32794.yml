aliases: []
summary: ArchiSteamFarm is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from
  multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint
  responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting
  config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for
  the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when
  updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in
  ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result
  access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and
  future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update,
  and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access
  from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.
