summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  IB/cm: Drop lockdep assert and WARN when freeing old msg

  The send completion handler can run after cm_id has advanced to another
  message.  The cm_id lock is not needed in this case, but a recent change
  re-used cm_free_priv_msg(), which asserts that the lock is held and
  WARNs if the cm_id's currently outstanding msg is different than the one
  being freed.
