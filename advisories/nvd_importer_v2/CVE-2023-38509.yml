summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. In org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-livetable-ui
  starting with version 3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.10.9 and 15.3-rc-1, the mail
  obfuscation configuration was not fully taken into account and is was still possible by obfuscated
  emails. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and XWiki 15.3-rc-1. A workaround is to modify
  the page `XWiki.LiveTableResultsMacros` following the patch.
