summary: node-tar,a Tar for Node.js, has a race condition vulnerability in versions up to and
  including 7.5.3. This is due to an incomplete handling of Unicode path collisions in the `path-reservations`
  system. On case-insensitive or normalization-insensitive filesystems (such as macOS APFS,
  In which it has been tested), the library fails to lock colliding paths (e.g., `ß` and `ss`),
  allowing them to be processed in parallel. This bypasses the library's internal concurrency
  safeguards and permits Symlink Poisoning attacks via race conditions. The library uses a `PathReservations`
  system to ensure that metadata checks and file operations for the same path are serialized.
  This prevents race conditions where one entry might clobber another concurrently. This is
  a Race Condition which enables Arbitrary File Overwrite. This vulnerability affects users
  and systems using node-tar on macOS (APFS/HFS+). Because of using `NFD` Unicode normalization
  (in which `ß` and `ss` are different), conflicting paths do not have their order properly
  preserved under filesystems that ignore Unicode normalization (e.g., APFS (in which `ß` causes
  an inode collision with `ss`)). This enables an attacker to circumvent internal parallelization
  locks (`PathReservations`) using conflicting filenames within a malicious tar archive. The
  patch in version 7.5.4 updates `path-reservations.js` to use a normalization form that matches
  the target filesystem's behavior (e.g., `NFKD`), followed by first `toLocaleLowerCase('en')`
  and then `toLocaleUpperCase('en')`. As a workaround, users who cannot upgrade promptly, and
  who are programmatically using `node-tar` to extract arbitrary tarball data should filter
  out all `SymbolicLink` entries (as npm does) to defend against arbitrary file writes via this
  file system entry name collision issue.
