aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions and below, a vulnerability
  in the Cursor CLI Beta allowed an attacker to achieve remote code execution through the MCP
  (Model Context Protocol) server mechanism by uploading a malicious MCP configuration in .cursor/mcp.json
  file in a GitHub repository. Once a victim clones the project and opens it using Cursor CLI,
  the command to run the malicious MCP server is immediately executed without any warning, leading
  to potential code execution as soon as the command runs. This issue is fixed in version 2025.09.17-25b418f.
