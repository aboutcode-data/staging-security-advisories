aliases: []
summary: liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum
  cryptography algorithms. liboqs prior to version 0.13.0 supports the HQC algorithm, an algorithm
  with a theoretical design flaw which leads to large numbers of malformed ciphertexts sharing
  the same implicit rejection value. Currently, no concrete attack on the algorithm is known.
  However, prospective users of HQC must take extra care when using the algorithm in protocols
  involving key derivation. In particular, HQC does not provide the same security guarantees
  as Kyber or ML-KEM. There is currently no patch for the HQC flaw available in liboqs, so HQC
  is disabled by default in liboqs starting from version 0.13.0. OQS will update its implementation
  after the HQC team releases an updated algorithm specification.
