summary: Akka.NET is a .NET port of the Akka project from the Scala / Java community. In all
  versions of Akka.Remote from v1.2.0 to v1.5.51, TLS could be enabled via our `akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp`
  transport and this would correctly enforce private key validation on the server-side of inbound
  connections. Akka.Remote, however, never asked the outbound-connecting client to present ITS
  certificate - therefore it's possible for untrusted parties to connect to a private key'd
  Akka.NET cluster and begin communicating with it without any certificate. The issue here is
  that for certificate-based authentication to work properly, ensuring that all members of the
  Akka.Remote network are secured with the same private key, Akka.Remote needed to implement
  mutual TLS. This was not the case before Akka.NET v1.5.52. Those who run Akka.NET inside a
  private network that they fully control or who were never using TLS in the first place are
  now affected by the bug. However, those who use TLS to secure their networks must upgrade
  to Akka.NET V1.5.52 or later. One patch forces "fail fast" semantics if TLS is enabled but
  the private key is missing or invalid. Previous versions would only check that once connection
  attempts occurred. The second patch, a critical fix, enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) by default,
  so both parties must be keyed using the same certificate. As a workaround, avoid exposing
  the application publicly to avoid the vulnerability having a practical impact on one's application.
  However, upgrading to version 1.5.52 is still recommended by the maintainers.
