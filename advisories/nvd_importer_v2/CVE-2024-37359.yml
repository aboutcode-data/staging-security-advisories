summary: "The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves\
  \ the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being\
  \ sent to the expected destination. (CWE-918) \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHitachi Vantara Pentaho Business\
  \ Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.0 and 9.3.0.9, including 8.3.x, do not validate\
  \ the Host header of incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBy providing URLs to unexpected\
  \ hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly\
  \ bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the\
  \ URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal\
  \ networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://),\
  \ or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over\
  \ the contents of requests."
