aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in UiPath App Studio 21.4.4. There is a persistent XSS vulnerability
  in the file-upload functionality for uploading icons when attempting to create new Apps. An
  attacker with minimal privileges in the application can build their own App and upload a malicious
  file containing an XSS payload, by uploading an arbitrary file and modifying the MIME type
  in a subsequent HTTP request. This then allows the file to be stored and retrieved from the
  server by other users in the same organization.
