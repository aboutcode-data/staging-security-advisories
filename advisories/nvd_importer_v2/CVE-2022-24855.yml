summary: 'Metabase is an open source business intelligence and analytics application. In affected
  versions Metabase ships with an internal development endpoint `/_internal` that can allow
  for cross site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially leading to phishing attempts with malicious
  links that could lead to account takeover. Users are advised to either upgrade immediately,
  or block access in your firewall to `/_internal` endpoints for Metabase. The following patches
  (or greater versions) are available: 0.42.4 and 1.42.4, 0.41.7 and 1.41.7, 0.40.8 and 1.40.8.'
