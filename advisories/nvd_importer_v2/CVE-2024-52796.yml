aliases: []
summary: Password Pusher, an open source application to communicate sensitive information over
  the web, comes with a configurable rate limiter.  In versions prior to v1.49.0, the rate limiter
  could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to
  the site potentially causing a denial of service. In v1.49.0, a fix was implemented to only
  authorize proxies on local IPs which resolves this issue. As a workaround, one may add rules
  to one's proxy and/or firewall to not accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*`
  from clients.
