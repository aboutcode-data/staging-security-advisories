aliases: []
summary: Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. A reflection
  cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in version 1.2.25. Attackers can exploit
  this vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of other users. The vulnerability is found
  in `templates_import.php.` When uploading an xml template file, if the XML file does not pass
  the check, the server will give a JavaScript pop-up prompt, which contains unfiltered xml
  template file name, resulting in XSS. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute
  actions on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized
  changes to settings. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.
