summary: 'CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. In versions prior to 1.12.2, a Denial
  of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation.
  The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing
  any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker
  could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually
  causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments.
  The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams`, which
  caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and
  `worker_pool_size`, which Introduces a server-wide, bounded worker pool to process incoming
  streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model
  and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available
  for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the
  `quic://` block in the Corefile, use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate
  excessive memory usage, and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.'
