aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 10.0 and 10.1. A hardcoded Flickr
  API key and secret are present in the publicly accessible Flickr Zimlet used by Zimbra Collaboration.
  Because these credentials are embedded directly in the Zimlet, any unauthorized party could
  retrieve them and misuse the Flickr integration. An attacker with access to the exposed credentials
  could impersonate the legitimate application and initiate valid Flickr OAuth flows. If a user
  is tricked into approving such a request, the attacker could gain access to the user s Flickr
  data. The hardcoded credentials have since been removed from the Zimlet code, and the associated
  key has been revoked.
