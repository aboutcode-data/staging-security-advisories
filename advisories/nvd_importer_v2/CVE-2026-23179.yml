aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvmet-tcp: fixup hang in nvmet_tcp_listen_data_ready()

  When the socket is closed while in TCP_LISTEN a callback is run to
  flush all outstanding packets, which in turns calls
  nvmet_tcp_listen_data_ready() with the sk_callback_lock held.
  So we need to check if we are in TCP_LISTEN before attempting
  to get the sk_callback_lock() to avoid a deadlock.
