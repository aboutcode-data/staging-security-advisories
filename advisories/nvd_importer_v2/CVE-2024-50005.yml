  mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker

  In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was
  accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According
  to RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable
  behavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing
  use-after-free issues.

  This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
  by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

  To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local
  variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical
  section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,
  ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU
  rules.
