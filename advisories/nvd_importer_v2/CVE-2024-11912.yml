aliases: []
summary: The Travel Booking WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to blind time-based
  SQL Injection via the ‘order_id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.6 due
  to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation
  on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append
  additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
  information from the database.
