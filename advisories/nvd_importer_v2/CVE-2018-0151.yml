aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and
  Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
  service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The vulnerability
  is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP
  port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer
  overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this
  vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device
  is reloading. The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device.
  Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf73881.'
