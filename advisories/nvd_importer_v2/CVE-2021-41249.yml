aliases: []
summary: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications.
  All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable
  to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL
  type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation
  autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema
  in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the
  URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a
  GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can
  run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful
  goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version
  1.7.28 or later.
