  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: sunxi-ng: Unregister clocks/resets when unbinding

  Currently, unbinding a CCU driver unmaps the device's MMIO region, while
  leaving its clocks/resets and their providers registered. This can cause
  a page fault later when some clock operation tries to perform MMIO. Fix
  this by separating the CCU initialization from the memory allocation,
  and then using a devres callback to unregister the clocks and resets.

  This also fixes a memory leak of the `struct ccu_reset`, and uses the
  correct owner (the specific platform driver) for the clocks and resets.

  Early OF clock providers are never unregistered, and limited error
  handling is possible, so they are mostly unchanged. The error reporting
  is made more consistent by moving the message inside of_sunxi_ccu_probe.
