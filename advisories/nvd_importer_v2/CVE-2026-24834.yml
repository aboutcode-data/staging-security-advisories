aliases: []
summary: 'Kata Containers is an open source project focusing on a standard implementation of
  lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that perform like containers. In versions prior to 3.27.0,
  an issue in Kata with Cloud Hypervisor allows a user of the container to modify the file system
  used by the Guest micro VM ultimately achieving arbitrary code execution as root in said VM.
  The current understanding is this doesn’t impact the security of the Host or of other containers
  / VMs running on that Host (note that arm64 QEMU lacks NVDIMM read-only support: It is believed
  that until the upstream QEMU gains this capability, a guest write could reach the image file).
  Version 3.27.0 patches the issue.'
