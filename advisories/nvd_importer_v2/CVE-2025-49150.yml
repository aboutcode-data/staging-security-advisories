aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Prior to 0.51.0, by default,
  the setting json.schemaDownload.enable was set to True. This means that by writing a JSON
  file, an attacker can trigger an arbitrary HTTP GET request that does not require user confirmation.
  Since the Cursor Agent can edit JSON files, this means a malicious agent, for example, after
  a prompt injection attack already succeeded, could trigger a GET request to an attacker controlled
  URL, potentially exfiltrating other data the agent may have access to. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.51.0.
