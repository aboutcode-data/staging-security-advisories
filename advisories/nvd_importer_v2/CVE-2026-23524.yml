aliases: []
summary: Laravel Reverb provides a real-time WebSocket communication backend for Laravel applications.
  In versions 1.6.3 and below, Reverb passes data from the Redis channel directly into PHP’s
  unserialize() function without restricting which classes can be instantiated, which leaves
  users vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The exploitability of this vulnerability is increased
  because Redis servers are commonly deployed without authentication, but only affects Laravel
  Reverb when horizontal scaling is enabled (REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=true). This issue has been
  fixed in version 1.7.0. As a workaround, require a strong password for Redis access and ensure
  the service is only accessible via a private network or local loopback, and/or set REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=false
  to bypass the vulnerable logic entirely (if the environment uses only one Reverb node).
