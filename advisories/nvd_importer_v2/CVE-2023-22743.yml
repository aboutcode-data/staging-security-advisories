aliases: []
summary: Git for Windows is the Windows port of the revision control system Git. Prior to Git
  for Windows version 2.39.2, by carefully crafting DLL and putting into a subdirectory of a
  specific name living next to the Git for Windows installer, Windows can be tricked into side-loading
  said DLL. This potentially allows users with local write access to place malicious payloads
  in a location where automated upgrades might run the Git for Windows installer with elevation.
  Version 2.39.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Never leave
  untrusted files in the Downloads folder or its sub-folders before executing the Git for Windows
  installer, or move the installer into a different directory before executing it.
