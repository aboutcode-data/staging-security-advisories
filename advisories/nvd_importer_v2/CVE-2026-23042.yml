summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  idpf: fix aux device unplugging when rdma is not supported by vport

  If vport flags do not contain VIRTCHNL2_VPORT_ENABLE_RDMA, driver does not
  allocate vdev_info for this vport. This leads to kernel NULL pointer
  dereference in idpf_idc_vport_dev_down(), which references vdev_info for
  every vport regardless.

  Check, if vdev_info was ever allocated before unplugging aux device.
