aliases: []
summary: anuko/timetracker is an, open source time tracking system. In affected versions Time
  Tracker uses browser_today hidden control on a few pages to collect the today's date from
  user browsers. Because of not checking this parameter for sanity in versions prior to 1.19.30.5601,
  it was possible to craft an html form with malicious JavaScript, use social engineering to
  convince logged on users to execute a POST from such form, and have the attacker-supplied
  JavaScript to be executed in user's browser. This has been patched in version 1.19.30.5600.
  Upgrade is recommended. If it is not practical, introduce ttValidDbDateFormatDate function
  as in the latest version and add a call to it within the access checks block.
