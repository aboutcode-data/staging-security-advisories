summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure\
  \ and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface\
  \ on an affected device.\r\n\r These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of\
  \ user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user\
  \ of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the\
  \ affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities,\
  \ the attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of\
  \ the affected device."
