aliases: []
summary: lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to a session reuse attack, allowing a removed user to
  change the organization name without proper authorization. The vulnerability stems from the
  lack of validation to check if a user is still part of an organization before allowing them
  to make changes. An attacker can exploit this by using an old authorization token to send
  a PATCH request, modifying the organization's name even after being removed from the organization.
  This issue is due to incorrect synchronization and affects the orgs.patch route.
