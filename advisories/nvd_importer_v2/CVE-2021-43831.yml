summary: Gradio is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models
  and demos. In versions prior to 2.5.0 there is a vulnerability that affects anyone who creates
  and publicly shares Gradio interfaces. File paths are not restricted and users who receive
  a Gradio link can access any files on the host computer if they know the file names or file
  paths. This is limited only by the host operating system. Paths are opened in read only mode.
  The problem has been patched in gradio 2.5.0.
