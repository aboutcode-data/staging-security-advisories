aliases: []
summary: Pixar's Tractor software, versions 2.2 and earlier, contain a stored cross-site scripting
  vulnerability in the field that allows a user to add a note to an existing node. The stored
  information is displayed when a user requests information about the node. An attacker could
  insert Javascript into this note field that is then saved and displayed to the end user. An
  attacker might include Javascript that could execute on an authenticated user's system that
  could lead to website redirects, session cookie hijacking, social engineering, etc. As this
  is stored with the information about the node, all other authenticated users with access to
  this data are also vulnerable.
