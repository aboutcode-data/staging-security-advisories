summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drbd: only clone bio if we have a backing device

  Commit c347a787e34cb (drbd: set ->bi_bdev in drbd_req_new) moved a
  bio_set_dev call (which has since been removed) to "earlier", from
  drbd_request_prepare to drbd_req_new.

  The problem is that this accesses device->ldev->backing_bdev, which is
  not NULL-checked at this point. When we don't have an ldev (i.e. when
  the DRBD device is diskless), this leads to a null pointer deref.

  So, only allocate the private_bio if we actually have a disk. This is
  also a small optimization, since we don't clone the bio to only to
  immediately free it again in the diskless case.
