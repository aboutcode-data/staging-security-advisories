aliases: []
summary: The SearchWiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  post titles in search results in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to
  the plugin using `esc_attr()` instead of `esc_html()` when outputting post titles in search
  results. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in post titles that will execute whenever a user
  performs a search and views the search results page.
