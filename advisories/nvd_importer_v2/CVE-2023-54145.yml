  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: drop unnecessary user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl log

  It's trivial for user to trigger "verifier log line truncated" warning,
  as verifier has a fixed-sized buffer of 1024 bytes (as of now), and there are at
  least two pieces of user-provided information that can be output through
  this buffer, and both can be arbitrarily sized by user:
    - BTF names;
    - BTF.ext source code lines strings.

  Verifier log buffer should be properly sized for typical verifier state
  output. But it's sort-of expected that this buffer won't be long enough
  in some circumstances. So let's drop the check. In any case code will
  work correctly, at worst truncating a part of a single line output.
