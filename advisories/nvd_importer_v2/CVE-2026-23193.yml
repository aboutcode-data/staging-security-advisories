summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: target: iscsi: Fix use-after-free in iscsit_dec_session_usage_count()

  In iscsit_dec_session_usage_count(), the function calls complete() while
  holding the sess->session_usage_lock. Similar to the connection usage count
  logic, the waiter signaled by complete() (e.g., in the session release
  path) may wake up and free the iscsit_session structure immediately.

  This creates a race condition where the current thread may attempt to
  execute spin_unlock_bh() on a session structure that has already been
  deallocated, resulting in a KASAN slab-use-after-free.

  To resolve this, release the session_usage_lock before calling complete()
  to ensure all dereferences of the sess pointer are finished before the
  waiter is allowed to proceed with deallocation.
