aliases: []
summary: In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured with different
  authentication providers on different ports one of which is an HTTP port, then the broker
  can be tricked by a remote unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP port into using
  an authentication provider that was configured on a different port. The attacker still needs
  valid credentials with the authentication provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue
  when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default
  accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented
  by this vulnerability. AMQP ports are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.
