summary: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access
  to digital resources. dspace-jspui is a UI component for DSpace. The JSPUI controlled vocabulary
  servlet is vulnerable to an open redirect attack, where an attacker can craft a malicious
  URL that looks like a legitimate DSpace/repository URL. When that URL is clicked by the target,
  it redirects them to a site of the attacker's choice. This issue has been patched in versions
  5.11 and 6.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.
