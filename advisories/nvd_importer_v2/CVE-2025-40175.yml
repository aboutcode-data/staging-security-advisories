  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  idpf: cleanup remaining SKBs in PTP flows

  When the driver requests Tx timestamp value, one of the first steps is
  to clone SKB using skb_get. It increases the reference counter for that
  SKB to prevent unexpected freeing by another component.
  However, there may be a case where the index is requested, SKB is
  assigned and never consumed by PTP flows - for example due to reset during
  running PTP apps.

  Add a check in release timestamping function to verify if the SKB
  assigned to Tx timestamp latch was freed, and release remaining SKBs.
