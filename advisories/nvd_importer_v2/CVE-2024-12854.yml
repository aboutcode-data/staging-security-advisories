aliases: []
summary: The Garden Gnome Package plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the functionality that automatically extracts 'ggpkg'
  files that have been uploaded in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.0. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files
  on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
