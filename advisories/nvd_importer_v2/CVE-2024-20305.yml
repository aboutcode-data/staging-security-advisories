aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface
  does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information.
