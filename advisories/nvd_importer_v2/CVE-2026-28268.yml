aliases: []
summary: Vikunja is an open-source self-hosted task management platform. Versions prior to 2.1.0
  have a business logic vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism of vikunja/api
  that allows password reset tokens to be reused indefinitely. Due to a failure to invalidate
  tokens upon use and a critical logic bug in the token cleanup cron job, reset tokens remain
  valid forever. This allows an attacker who intercepts a single reset token (via logs, browser
  history, or phishing) to perform a complete, persistent account takeover at any point in the
  future, bypassing standard authentication controls. Version 2.1.0 contains a patch for the
  issue.
