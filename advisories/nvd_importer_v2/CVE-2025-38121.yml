aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: iwlwifi: mld: avoid panic on init failure

  In case of an error during init, in_hw_restart will be set, but it will
  never get cleared.
  Instead, we will retry to init again, and then we will act like we are in a
  restart when we are actually not.

  This causes (among others) to a NULL pointer dereference when canceling
  rx_omi::finished_work, that was not even initialized, because we thought
  that we are in hw_restart.

  Set in_hw_restart to true only if the fw is running, then we know that
  FW was loaded successfully and we are not going to the retry loop.
