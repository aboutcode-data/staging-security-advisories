  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary

  In the ARM64 BPF JIT when prog->aux->exception_boundary is set for a BPF
  program, find_used_callee_regs() is not called because for a program
  acting as exception boundary, all callee saved registers are saved.
  find_used_callee_regs() sets `ctx->fp_used = true;` when it sees FP
  being used in any of the instructions.

  For programs acting as exception boundary, ctx->fp_used remains false
  even if frame pointer is used by the program and therefore, FP is not
  set-up for such programs in the prologue. This can cause the kernel to
  crash due to a pagefault.

  Fix it by setting ctx->fp_used = true for exception boundary programs as
  fp is always saved in such programs.
