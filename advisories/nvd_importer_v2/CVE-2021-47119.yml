summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: fix memory leak in ext4_fill_super

  Buffer head references must be released before calling kill_bdev();
  otherwise the buffer head (and its page referenced by b_data) will not
  be freed by kill_bdev, and subsequently that bh will be leaked.

  If blocksizes differ, sb_set_blocksize() will kill current buffers and
  page cache by using kill_bdev(). And then super block will be reread
  again but using correct blocksize this time. sb_set_blocksize() didn't
  fully free superblock page and buffer head, and being busy, they were
  not freed and instead leaked.

  This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of:

    systemctl start <ext4_on_lvm>.mount, and
    systemctl stop <ext4_on_lvm>.mount

  ... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and
  the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never
  gets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed.
