summary: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version
  version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running
  (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically
  accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected
  version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default,
  elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted
  by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software)
  have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such
  services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only
  able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play
  audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control
  the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any
  that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood
  of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals
  when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk
  entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all,
  and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).
