aliases: []
summary: In sourcecodetester Engineers Online Portal as of 10-21-21, an attacker can manipulate
  the Host header as seen by the web application and cause the application to behave in unexpected
  ways. Very often multiple websites are hosted on the same IP address. This is where the Host
  Header comes in. This header specifies which website should process the HTTP request. The
  web server uses the value of this header to dispatch the request to the specified website.
  Each website hosted on the same IP address is called a virtual host. And It's possible to
  send requests with arbitrary Host Headers to the first virtual host.
