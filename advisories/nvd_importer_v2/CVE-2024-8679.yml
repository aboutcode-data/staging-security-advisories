aliases: []
summary: The Library Management System – Manage e-Digital Books Library plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘value' parameter of the owt_lib_handler AJAX action
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
  parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database.
