summary: "A vulnerability in the implementation of the CLI on a device that is running ConfD\
  \ could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack.\r\n\
  \ The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of a process argument on an affected\
  \ device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting commands during the execution\
  \ of this process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands\
  \ on the underlying operating system with the privilege level of ConfD, which is commonly\
  \ root."
