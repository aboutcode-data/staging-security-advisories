aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform
  Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on
  an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently
  protect sensitive data when responding to a specific API request. An attacker could exploit
  the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected application. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the users of the application,
  including security questions and answers. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would
  need valid Administrator credentials. Cisco expects to release software updates that address
  this vulnerability.
