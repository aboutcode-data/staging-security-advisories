aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the Mail Disguise module before 1.x-1.0.5 for Backdrop CMS.
  It enables a website to obfuscate email addresses, and should prevent spambots from collecting
  them. The module doesn't sufficiently validate the data attribute value on links, potentially
  leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This is mitigated by the fact an attacker
  must be able to insert link (<a>) HTML elements containing data attributes into the page.
