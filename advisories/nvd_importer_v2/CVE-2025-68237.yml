summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mtdchar: fix integer overflow in read/write ioctls

  The "req.start" and "req.len" variables are u64 values that come from the
  user at the start of the function.  We mask away the high 32 bits of
  "req.len" so that's capped at U32_MAX but the "req.start" variable can go
  up to U64_MAX which means that the addition can still integer overflow.

  Use check_add_overflow() to fix this bug.
