aliases: []
summary: By launching the drb_remote_codeexec exploit, a Metasploit Framework user will inadvertently
  expose Metasploit to the same deserialization issue that is exploited by that module, due
  to the reliance on the vulnerable Distributed Ruby class functions. Since Metasploit Framework
  typically runs with elevated privileges, this can lead to a system compromise on the Metasploit
  workstation. Note that an attacker would have to lie in wait and entice the Metasploit user
  to run the affected module against a malicious endpoint in a "hack-back" type of attack. Metasploit
  is only vulnerable when the drb_remote_codeexec module is running. In most cases, this cannot
  happen automatically.
