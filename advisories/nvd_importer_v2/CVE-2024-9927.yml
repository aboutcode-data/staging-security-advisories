summary: The WooCommerce Order Proposal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via order proposal in all versions up to and including 2.0.5. This is due to the improper
  implementation of allow_payment_without_login function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to log in to WordPress as an arbitrary
  user account, including administrators.
