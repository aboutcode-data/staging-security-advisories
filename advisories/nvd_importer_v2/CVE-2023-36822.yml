aliases: []
summary: Uptime Kuma, a self-hosted monitoring tool, has a path traversal vulnerability in versions
  prior to 1.22.1. Uptime Kuma allows authenticated users to install plugins from an official
  list of plugins. This feature is currently disabled in the web interface, but the corresponding
  API endpoints are still available after login. Before a plugin is downloaded, the plugin installation
  directory is checked for existence. If it exists, it's removed before the plugin installation.
  Because the plugin is not validated against the official list of plugins or sanitized, the
  check for existence and the removal of the plugin installation directory are prone to path
  traversal. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to delete files from the server
  Uptime Kuma is running on. Depending on which files are deleted, Uptime Kuma or the whole
  system may become unavailable due to data loss.
