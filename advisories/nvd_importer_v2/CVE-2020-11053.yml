aliases: []
summary: In OAuth2 Proxy before 5.1.1, there is an open redirect vulnerability. Users can provide
  a redirect address for the proxy to send the authenticated user to at the end of the authentication
  flow. This is expected to be the original URL that the user was trying to access. This redirect
  URL is checked within the proxy and validated before redirecting the user to prevent malicious
  actors providing redirects to potentially harmful sites. However, by crafting a redirect URL
  with HTML encoded whitespace characters the validation could be bypassed and allow a redirect
  to any URL provided. This has been patched in 5.1.1.
