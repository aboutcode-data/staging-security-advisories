aliases: []
summary: A flaw was identified in the Docker v2 authentication endpoint of Keycloak, where tokens
  continue to be issued even after a Docker registry client has been administratively disabled.
  This means that turning the client “Enabled” setting to OFF does not fully prevent access.
  As a result, previously valid credentials can still be used to obtain authentication tokens.
  This weakens administrative controls and could allow unintended access to container registry
  resources.
