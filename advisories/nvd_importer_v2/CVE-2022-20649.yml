summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco&nbsp;RCM for Cisco&nbsp;StarOS Software could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to perform remote code execution on the application with root-level privileges&nbsp;in\
  \ the context of the configured container.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the debug\
  \ mode is incorrectly enabled for specific services. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by connecting to the device and navigating to the service with debug mode enabled. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.\r\nThe\
  \ attacker would need to perform detailed reconnaissance to allow for unauthenticated access.\
  \ The vulnerability can also be exploited by an authenticated attacker.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has\
  \ released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that\
  \ address this vulnerability."
