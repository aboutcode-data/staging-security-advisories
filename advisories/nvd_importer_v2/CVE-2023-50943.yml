summary: Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.1, have a vulnerability that allows a potential
  attacker to poison the XCom data by bypassing the protection of "enable_xcom_pickling=False"

  is considered low since it requires a DAG author to exploit it. Users are recommended to upgrade
  to version 2.8.1 or later, which fixes this issue.
