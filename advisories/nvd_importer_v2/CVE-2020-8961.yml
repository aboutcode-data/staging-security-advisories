aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Avira Free-Antivirus before 15.0.2004.1825. The Self-Protection
  feature does not prohibit a write operation from an external process. Thus, code injection
  can be used to turn off this feature. After that, one can construct an event that will modify
  a file at a specific location, and pass this event to the driver, thereby defeating the anti-virus
  functionality.
