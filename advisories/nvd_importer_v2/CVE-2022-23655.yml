aliases: []
summary: Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Affected
  versions of OctoberCMS did not validate gateway server signatures. As a result non-authoritative
  gateway servers may be used to exfiltrate user private keys. Users are advised to upgrade
  their installations to build 474 or v1.1.10. The only known workaround is to manually apply
  the patch (e3b455ad587282f0fbcb7763c6d9c3d000ca1e6a) which adds server signature validation.
