  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: aloop: Fix racy access at PCM trigger

  The PCM trigger callback of aloop driver tries to check the PCM state
  and stop the stream of the tied substream in the corresponding cable.
  Since both check and stop operations are performed outside the cable
  lock, this may result in UAF when a program attempts to trigger
  frequently while opening/closing the tied stream, as spotted by
  fuzzers.

  For addressing the UAF, this patch changes two things:
  - It covers the most of code in loopback_check_format() with
    cable->lock spinlock, and add the proper NULL checks.  This avoids
    already some racy accesses.
  - In addition, now we try to check the state of the capture PCM stream
    that may be stopped in this function, which was the major pain point
    leading to UAF.
