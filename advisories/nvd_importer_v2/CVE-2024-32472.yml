aliases: []
summary: excalidraw is an open source virtual hand-drawn style whiteboard. A stored XSS vulnerability
  in Excalidraw's web embeddable component. This allows arbitrary JavaScript to be run in the
  context of the domain where the editor is hosted. There were two vectors. One rendering untrusted
  string as iframe's `srcdoc` without properly sanitizing against HTML injection. Second by
  improperly sanitizing against attribute HTML injection. This in conjunction with allowing
  `allow-same-origin` sandbox flag (necessary for several embeds) resulted in the XSS. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 0.17.6 and 0.16.4.
