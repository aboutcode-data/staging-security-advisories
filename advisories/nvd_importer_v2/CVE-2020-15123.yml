aliases: []
summary: In codecov (npm package) before version 3.7.1 the upload method has a command injection
  vulnerability. Clients of the codecov-node library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they
  might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability. A similar CVE (CVE-2020-7597 for
  GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh) was issued but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked &, and command
  injection is still possible using backticks instead to bypass the sanitizer. The attack surface
  is low in this case. Particularly in the standard use of codecov, where the module is used
  directly in a build pipeline, not built against as a library in another application that may
  supply malicious input and perform command injection.
