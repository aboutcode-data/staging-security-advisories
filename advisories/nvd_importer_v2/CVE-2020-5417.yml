aliases: []
summary: Cloud Foundry CAPI (Cloud Controller), versions prior to 1.97.0, when used in a deployment
  where an app domain is also the system domain (which is true in the default CF Deployment
  manifest), were vulnerable to developers maliciously or accidentally claiming certain sensitive
  routes, potentially resulting in the developer's app handling some requests that were expected
  to go to certain system components.
