aliases: []
summary: ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems
  with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the ZimaOS API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v3/file?token=<token>&files=<file_path>`
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file reading due to improper input validation. By manipulating
  the `files` parameter, authenticated users can read sensitive system files, including `/etc/shadow`,
  which contains password hashes for all users. This vulnerability exposes critical system data
  and poses a high risk for privilege escalation or system compromise. The vulnerability occurs
  because the API endpoint does not validate or restrict file paths provided via the `files`
  parameter. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the file path to access sensitive
  files outside the intended directory. As of time of publication, no known patched versions
  are available.
