aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the NETCONF service of Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO)\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) on an affected\
  \ system that is running as the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must\
  \ be a member of the admin group.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because user-supplied input\
  \ is not properly validated when NETCONF is used to upload packages to an affected device.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted package file.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write crafted files to arbitrary locations\
  \ on the filesystem or delete arbitrary files from the filesystem of an affected device, resulting\
  \ in a DoS condition. \r\n\r Note: By default, during install, Cisco NSO will be set up to\
  \ run as the root user unless the --run-as-user option is used."
