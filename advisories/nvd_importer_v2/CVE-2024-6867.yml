aliases: []
summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary, specifically
  in the `runs/{run_id}/related` endpoint. This endpoint does not verify that the user has the
  necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only
  the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This
  issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users
  to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of
  a public or non-public run.
