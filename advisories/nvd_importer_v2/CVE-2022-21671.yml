aliases: []
summary: '@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit''s container protocol. A
  vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to
  7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone
  fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the
  library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy
  has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server
  that is outside of Replit''s control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained
  by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched
  in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new
  one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`)
  in the `ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in the GitHub Security
  Advisory.'
