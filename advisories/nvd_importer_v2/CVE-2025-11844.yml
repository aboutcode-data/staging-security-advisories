aliases: []
summary: Hugging Face Smolagents version 1.20.0 contains an XPath injection vulnerability in
  the search_item_ctrl_f function located in src/smolagents/vision_web_browser.py. The function
  constructs an XPath query by directly concatenating user-supplied input into the XPath expression
  without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XPath
  syntax that can alter the intended query logic. The vulnerability enables attackers to bypass
  search filters, access unintended DOM elements, and disrupt web automation workflows. This
  can lead to information disclosure, manipulation of AI agent interactions, and compromise
  the reliability of automated web tasks. The issue is fixed in version 1.22.0.
