summary: The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2 via the 'get_audio' function. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to make web requests
  to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify
  information from internal services, if "Public API" is enabled in the plugin settings, and
  'allow_url_fopen' is set to 'On' on the server.
