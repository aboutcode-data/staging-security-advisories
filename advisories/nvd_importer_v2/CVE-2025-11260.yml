aliases: []
summary: The WP Headless CMS Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to protection mechanism
  bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.15. This is due to the plugin only checking
  for the existence of the Authorization header in a request when determining if the nonce protection
  should be bypassed. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access content
  they should not have access to.
