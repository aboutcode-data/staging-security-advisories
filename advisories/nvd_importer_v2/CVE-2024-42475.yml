aliases: []
summary: In the OAuth library for nim prior to version 0.11, the `state` values generated by
  the `generateState` function do not have sufficient entropy. These can be successfully guessed
  by an attacker allowing them to perform a CSRF vs a user, associating the user's session with
  the attacker's protected resources. While `state` isn't exactly a cryptographic value, it
  should be generated in a cryptographically secure way. `generateState` should be using a CSPRNG.
  Version 0.11 modifies the `generateState` function to generate `state` values of at least
  128 bits of entropy while using a CSPRNG.
