  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen: speed up grant-table reclaim

  When a grant entry is still in use by the remote domain, Linux must put
  it on a deferred list.  Normally, this list is very short, because
  the PV network and block protocols expect the backend to unmap the grant
  first.  However, Qubes OS's GUI protocol is subject to the constraints
  of the X Window System, and as such winds up with the frontend unmapping
  the window first.  As a result, the list can grow very large, resulting
  in a massive memory leak and eventual VM freeze.

  To partially solve this problem, make the number of entries that the VM
  will attempt to free at each iteration tunable.  The default is still
  10, but it can be overridden via a module parameter.

  This is Cc: stable because (when combined with appropriate userspace
  changes) it fixes a severe performance and stability problem for Qubes
  OS users.
