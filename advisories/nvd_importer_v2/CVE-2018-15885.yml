aliases: []
summary: Ovation FindMe 1.4-1083-1 is intended to support transmission of network traffic from
  covert video recorders but does not properly disrupt binary analysis for discovering the product's
  capabilities or purpose. This makes it easier for adversaries to detect the covert operation.
  Specifically, the product uses a compression technique to prevent the identification of certain
  libraries in the software by obfuscation. The software relies on a TLS callback and an additional
  executable file to enable these libraries and their access to certain websites. The unpacked
  software can be exploited by several different types of documented techniques.
