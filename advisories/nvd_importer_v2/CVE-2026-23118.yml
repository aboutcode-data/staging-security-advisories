  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rxrpc: Fix data-race warning and potential load/store tearing

  Fix the following:

          BUG: KCSAN: data-race in rxrpc_peer_keepalive_worker / rxrpc_send_data_packet

  which is reporting an issue with the reads and writes to ->last_tx_at in:

          conn->peer->last_tx_at = ktime_get_seconds();

  and:

          keepalive_at = peer->last_tx_at + RXRPC_KEEPALIVE_TIME;

  The lockless accesses to these to values aren't actually a problem as the
  read only needs an approximate time of last transmission for the purposes
  of deciding whether or not the transmission of a keepalive packet is
  warranted yet.

  Also, as ->last_tx_at is a 64-bit value, tearing can occur on a 32-bit
  arch.

  Fix both of these by switching to an unsigned int for ->last_tx_at and only
  storing the LSW of the time64_t.  It can then be reconstructed at need
  provided no more than 68 years has elapsed since the last transmission.
