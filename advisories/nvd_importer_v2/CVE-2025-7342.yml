aliases: []
summary: A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder where default credentials
  are enabled during the Windows image build process when using the Nutanix or VMware OVA providers.
  These credentials, which allow root access, are disabled at the conclusion of the build. Kubernetes
  clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project
  and the vulnerability was exploited during the build process, which requires an attacker to
  access the build VM and modify the image while the build is in progress.
