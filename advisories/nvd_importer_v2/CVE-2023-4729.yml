aliases: []
summary: The LadiApp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to
  a missing nonce check on the publish_lp() function hooked via an AJAX action in versions up
  to, and including, 4.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the
  LadiPage key (a key fully controlled by the attacker), enabling them to freely create new
  pages, including web pages that trigger stored XSS via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
