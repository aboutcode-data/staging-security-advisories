  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nilfs2: fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread

  Patch series "nilfs2: fix log writer related issues".

  This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 log writer-related issues,
  including a timer use-after-free issue and potential deadlock issue on
  unmount, and a potential freeze issue in event synchronization found
  during their analysis.  Details are described in each commit log.


  This patch (of 3):

  A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on
  the nilfs_sc_info structure.

  The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log
  writer thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure
  is about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime.

  Fix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer
  thread is alive.
