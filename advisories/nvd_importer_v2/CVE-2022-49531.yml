aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  loop: implement ->free_disk

  Ensure that the lo_device which is stored in the gendisk private
  data is valid until the gendisk is freed.  Currently the loop driver
  uses a lot of effort to make sure a device is not freed when it is
  still in use, but to to fix a potential deadlock this will be relaxed
  a bit soon.
