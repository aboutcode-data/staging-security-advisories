summary: The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python applications
  that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. Versions prior to 3.0.2
  are vulnerable to command injection via single sign-on(SSO) browser URL authentication. In
  order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful
  in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource.
  The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO
  URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously
  crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading
  to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting
  as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch for this issue.
