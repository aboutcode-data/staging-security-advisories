aliases: []
summary: AutoGPT, a component of significant-gravitas/autogpt, is vulnerable to an improper
  neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') due to a
  flaw in its shell command validation function. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in versions
  v0.5.0 up to but not including 5.1.0. The issue arises from the application's method of validating
  shell commands against an allowlist or denylist, where it only checks the first word of the
  command. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions by crafting commands
  that are executed despite not being on the allowlist or by including malicious commands not
  present in the denylist. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker
  to execute arbitrary shell commands.
