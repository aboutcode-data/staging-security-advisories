aliases: []
summary: rack-contrib provides contributed rack middleware and utilities for Rack, a Ruby web
  server interface. Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service
  due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation.
  This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential
  denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the
  issue.
