aliases: []
summary: Apache NiFi 1.1.0 through 2.7.2 are missing authorization when updating configuration
  properties on extension components that have specific Required Permissions based on the Restricted
  annotation. The Restricted annotation indicates additional privileges required to add the
  annotated component to the flow configuration, but framework authorization did not check restricted
  status when updating a component previously added. The missing authorization requires a more
  privileged user to add a restricted component to the flow configuration, but permits a less
  privileged user to make property configuration changes. Apache NiFi installations that do
  not implement different levels of authorization for Restricted components are not subject
  to this vulnerability because the framework enforces write permissions as the security boundary.
  Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.8.0 is the recommended mitigation.
