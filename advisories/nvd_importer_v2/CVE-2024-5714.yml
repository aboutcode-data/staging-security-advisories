aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.4, an improper access control vulnerability allows
  members with team management permissions to manipulate project identifiers in requests, enabling
  them to invite users to projects in other organizations, change members to projects in other
  organizations with escalated privileges, and change members from other organizations to their
  own or other projects, also with escalated privileges. This vulnerability is due to the backend's
  failure to validate project identifiers against the current user's organization ID and projects
  belonging to it, as well as a misconfiguration in attribute naming (`org_id` should be `orgId`)
  that prevents proper user organization validation. As a result, attackers can cause inconsistencies
  on the platform for affected users and organizations, including unauthorized privilege escalation.
  The issue is present in the backend API endpoints for user invitation and modification, specifically
  in the handling of project IDs in requests.
