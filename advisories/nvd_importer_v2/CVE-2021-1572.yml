aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in ConfD could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands at the level of the account under which ConfD is running, which is commonly root.
  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on an affected device.
  The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly runs the SFTP user service
  at the privilege level of the account that was running when the ConfD built-in Secure Shell
  (SSH) server for CLI was enabled. If the ConfD built-in SSH server was not enabled, the device
  is not affected by this vulnerability. An attacker with low-level privileges could exploit
  this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a series of commands
  at the SFTP interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges
  to the level of the account under which ConfD is running, which is commonly root. Note: Any
  user who can authenticate to the built-in SSH server may exploit this vulnerability. By default,
  all ConfD users have this access if the server is enabled. Software updates that address this
  vulnerability have been released.'
