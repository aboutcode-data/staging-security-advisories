aliases: []
summary: When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document,
  Hancom Office 2014 will use a field from the structure in an operation that can cause the
  integer to overflow. This result is then used to allocate memory to copy file data in. Due
  to the lack of bounds checking on the integer, the allocated memory buffer can be made to
  be undersized at which point the reading of file data will write outside the bounds of the
  buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
