summary: The X Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the Youtube Video ID field in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.14. This
  is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the Youtube Video ID parameter.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an affected
  page.
