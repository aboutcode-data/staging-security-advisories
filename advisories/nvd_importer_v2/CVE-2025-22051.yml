  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  staging: gpib: Fix Oops after disconnect in agilent usb

  If the agilent usb dongle is disconnected subsequent calls to the
  driver cause a NULL dereference Oops as the bus_interface
  is set to NULL on disconnect.

  This problem was introduced by setting usb_dev from the bus_interface
  for dev_xxx messages.

  Previously bus_interface was checked for NULL only in the functions
  directly calling usb_fill_bulk_urb or usb_control_msg.

  Check for valid bus_interface on all interface entry points
  and return -ENODEV if it is NULL.
