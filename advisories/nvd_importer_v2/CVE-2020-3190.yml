aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the IPsec packet processor of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow
  an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for IPsec
  sessions to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of packets by
  the IPsec packet processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious
  ICMP error messages to an affected device that get punted to the IPsec packet processor. A
  successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete IPsec memory, resulting in all future
  IPsec packets to an affected device being dropped by the device. Manual intervention is required
  to recover from this situation.
