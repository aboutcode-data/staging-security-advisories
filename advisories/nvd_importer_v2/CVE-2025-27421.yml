aliases: []
summary: Abacus is a highly scalable and stateless counting API. A critical goroutine leak vulnerability
  has been identified in the Abacus server's Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. The issue
  occurs when clients disconnect from the /stream endpoint, as the server fails to properly
  clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion
  where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections while
  maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves improper channel cleanup
  in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 1.4.0.
