aliases: []
summary: ironic-image is a container image to run OpenStack Ironic as part of Metal³. Prior
  to version capm3-v1.4.3, if Ironic is not deployed with TLS and it does not have API and Conductor
  split into separate services, access to the API is not protected by any authentication. Ironic
  API is also listening in host network. In case the node is not behind a firewall, the API
  could be accessed by anyone via network without authentication. By default, Ironic API in
  Metal3 is protected by TLS and basic authentication, so this vulnerability requires operator
  to configure API without TLS for it to be vulnerable. TLS and authentication however should
  not be coupled as they are in versions prior to capm3-v1.4.3. A patch exists in versions capm3-v1.4.3
  and newer. Some workarounds are available. Either configure TLS for Ironic API (`deploy.sh
  -t ...`, `IRONIC_TLS_SETUP=true`) or split Ironic API and Conductor via configuration change
  (old implementation, not recommended). With both workarounds, services are configured with
  httpd front-end, which has proper authentication configuration in place.
