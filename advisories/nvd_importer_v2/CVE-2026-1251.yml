aliases: []
summary: The SupportCandy – Helpdesk & Customer Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.4
  via the 'add_reply' function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to steal
  file attachments uploaded by other users by specifying arbitrary attachment IDs in the 'description_attachments'
  parameter, re-associating those files to their own tickets and removing access from the original
  owners.
