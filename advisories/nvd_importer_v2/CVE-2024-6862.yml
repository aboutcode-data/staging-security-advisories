aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version
  1.2.34 due to overly permissive CORS settings. This vulnerability allows an attacker to sign
  up for and create projects or use the instance as if they were a user with local access. The
  main attack vector is for instances hosted locally on personal machines, which are not publicly
  accessible. The CORS settings in the backend permit all origins, exposing unauthenticated
  endpoints to CSRF attacks.
