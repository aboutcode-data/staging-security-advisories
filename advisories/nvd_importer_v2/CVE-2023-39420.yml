aliases: []
summary: The RDPCore.dll component as used in the IRM Next Generation booking engine, allows
  a remote user to connect to customers with an "admin" account and a corresponding password
  computed daily by a routine inside the DLL file. Once reverse-engineered, this routine can
  help an attacker generate the daily password and connect to application customers. Given that
  this is an administrative account, anyone logging into a customer deployment has full, unrestricted
  access to the application.
