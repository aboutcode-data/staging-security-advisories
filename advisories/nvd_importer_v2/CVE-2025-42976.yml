aliases: []
summary: SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP (BIC Document) allows an authenticated attacker
  to craft a request that, when submitted to a BIC Document application, could cause a memory
  corruption error. On successful exploitation, this results in the crash of the target component.
  Multiple submissions can make the target completely unavailable. A similarly crafted submission
  can be used to perform an out-of-bounds read operation as well, revealing sensitive information
  that is loaded in memory at that time. There is no ability to modify any information.
