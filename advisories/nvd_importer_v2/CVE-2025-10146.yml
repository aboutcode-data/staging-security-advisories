summary: The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘user_ids’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.23 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
