summary: Formwork is a flat file-based Content Management System (CMS). Prior to version 2.2.0,
  inserting unsanitized data into the blog tag field results in stored cross‑site scripting

  post will have attacker‑controlled script executed in their browser. The issue is persistent
  and impacts privileged administrative workflows. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.
