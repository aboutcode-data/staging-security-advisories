summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Player for Windows and MacOS could allow an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of values in Webex recording files that are in Webex Recording Format (WRF). An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious WRF file through a
  link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software
  on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code
  on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.
