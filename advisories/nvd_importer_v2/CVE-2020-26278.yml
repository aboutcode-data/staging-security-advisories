summary: 'Weave Net is open source software which creates a virtual network that connects Docker
  containers across multiple hosts and enables their automatic discovery. Weave Net before version
  2.8.0 has a vulnerability in which can allow an attacker to take over any host in the cluster.
  Weave Net is supplied with a manifest that runs pods on every node in a Kubernetes cluster,
  which are responsible for managing network connections for all other pods in the cluster.
  This requires a lot of power over the host, and the manifest sets `privileged: true`, which
  gives it that power. It also set `hostPID: true`, which gave it the ability to access all
  other processes on the host, and write anywhere in the root filesystem of the host. This setting
  was not necessary, and is being removed. You are only vulnerable if you have an additional
  vulnerability (e.g. a bug in Kubernetes) or misconfiguration that allows an attacker to run
  code inside the Weave Net pod, No such bug is known at the time of release, and there are
  no known instances of this being exploited. Weave Net 2.8.0 removes the hostPID setting and
  moves CNI plugin install to an init container. Users who do not update to 2.8.0 can edit the
  hostPID line in their existing DaemonSet manifest to say false instead of true, arrange some
  other way to install CNI plugins (e.g. Ansible) and remove those mounts from the DaemonSet
  manifest.'
