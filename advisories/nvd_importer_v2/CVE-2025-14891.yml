aliases: []
summary: The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'displayName' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.93.1 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with customer-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. While it is possible to invoke
  the AJAX action without authentication, the attacker would need to know a valid form ID, which
  requires them to place an order. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers
  if guest checkout is enabled. However, the form ID still needs to be obtained through placing
  an order.
