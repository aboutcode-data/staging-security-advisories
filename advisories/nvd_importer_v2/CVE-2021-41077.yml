aliases: []
summary: The activation process in Travis CI, for certain 2021-09-03 through 2021-09-10 builds,
  causes secret data to have unexpected sharing that is not specified by the customer-controlled
  .travis.yml file. In particular, the desired behavior (if .travis.yml has been created locally
  by a customer, and added to git) is for a Travis service to perform builds in a way that prevents
  public access to customer-specific secret environment data such as signing keys, access credentials,
  and API tokens. However, during the stated 8-day interval, secret data could be revealed to
  an unauthorized actor who forked a public repository and printed files during a build process.
