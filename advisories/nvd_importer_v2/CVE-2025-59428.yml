aliases: []
summary: EspoCRM is an open source customer relationship management application. In versions
  before 9.1.9, a vulnerability allows arbitrary user creation, including administrative accounts,
  through a combination of stored SVG injection and lack of CSRF protection. An attacker with
  Knowledge Base edit permissions can embed a malicious SVG element containing a link in the
  body field of an article. When an authenticated user clicks the malicious link, they are redirected
  to an attacker-controlled HTML page that executes a CSRF request against the api/v1/User endpoint.
  If the victim is prompted for and enters their credentials, an attacker-controlled account
  is created with privileges determined by the CSRF payload. This issue has been patched in
  version 9.1.9.
