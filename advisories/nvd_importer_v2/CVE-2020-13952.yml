aliases: []
summary: In the course of work on the open source project it was discovered that authenticated
  users running queries against Hive and Presto database engines could access information via
  a number of templated fields including the contents of query description metadata database,
  the hashed version of the authenticated users’ password, and access to connection information
  including the plaintext password for the current connection. It would also be possible to
  run arbitrary methods on the database connection object for the Presto or Hive connection,
  allowing the user to bypass security controls internal to Superset. This vulnerability is
  present in every Apache Superset version < 0.37.2.
