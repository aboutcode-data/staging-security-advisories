aliases: []
summary: Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server contains an unsafe deserialization vulnerability
  in the Web Console. An attacker with write access to the local database could cause arbitrary
  code to execute with SYSTEM privileges on the underlying server when a Web Console user triggers
  retrieval of that data. When chained with a SQL injection vulnerability, the vulnerability
  could be exploited remotely if Web Console users click a series of maliciously crafted URLs.
  All versions prior to 7.11.2 are affected.
