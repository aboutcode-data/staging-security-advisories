aliases: []
summary: Zed, a code editor, has an extension installer allows tar/gzip downloads. Prior to
  version 0.224.4, the tar extractor (`async_tar::Archive::unpack`) creates symlinks from the
  archive without validation, and the path guard (`writeable_path_from_extension`) only performs
  lexical prefix checks without resolving symlinks. An attacker can ship a tar that first creates
  a symlink inside the extension workdir pointing outside (e.g., `escape -> /`), then writes
  files through the symlink, causing writes to arbitrary host paths. This escapes the extension
  sandbox and enables code execution. Version 0.224.4 patches the issue.
