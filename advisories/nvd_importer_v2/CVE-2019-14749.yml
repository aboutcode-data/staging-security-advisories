aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1. CSV (aka
  Formula) injection exists in the export spreadsheets functionality. These spreadsheets are
  generated dynamically from unvalidated or unfiltered user input in the Name and Internal Notes
  fields in the Users tab, and the Issue Summary field in the tickets tab. This allows other
  agents to download data in a .csv file format or .xls file format. This is used as input for
  spreadsheet applications such as Excel and OpenOffice Calc, resulting in a situation where
  cells in the spreadsheets can contain input from an untrusted source. As a result, the end
  user who is accessing the exported spreadsheet can be affected.
