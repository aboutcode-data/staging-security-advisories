summary: The Password for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the get3_init_admin_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
