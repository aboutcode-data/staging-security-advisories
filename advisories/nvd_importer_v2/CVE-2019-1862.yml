aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (Web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell
  of an affected device with root privileges. The vulnerability occurs because the affected
  software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator
  access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input
  parameter on a form in the Web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges, which may
  lead to complete system compromise.
