aliases: []
summary: MX Player Android App versions prior to v1.24.5, are vulnerable to a directory traversal
  vulnerability when user is using the MX Transfer feature in "Receive" mode. An attacker can
  exploit this by connecting to the MX Transfer session as a "sender" and sending a MessageType
  of "FILE_LIST" with a "name" field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will
  result in the file being transferred to the victim's phone, but being saved outside of the
  intended "/sdcard/MXshare" directory. In some instances, an attacker can achieve remote code
  execution by writing ".odex" and ".vdex" files in the "oat" directory of the MX Player application.
