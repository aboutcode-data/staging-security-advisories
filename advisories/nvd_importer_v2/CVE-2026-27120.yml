aliases: []
summary: Leafkit is a templating language with Swift-inspired syntax. Prior to 1.4.1, htmlEscaped
  in leaf-kit will only escape html special characters if the extended grapheme clusters match,
  which allows bypassing escaping by using an extended grapheme cluster containing both the
  special html character and some additional characters. In the case of html attributes, this
  can lead to XSS if there is a leaf variable in the attribute that is user controlled. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.1.
