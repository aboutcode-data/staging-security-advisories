summary: 'Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user''s
  configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided
  by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption
  was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if
  an attacker has access to the user''s configuration data. This issue affects: Apache OpenOffice
