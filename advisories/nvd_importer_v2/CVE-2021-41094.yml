aliases: []
summary: Wire is an open source secure messenger. Users of Wire by Bund may bypass the mandatory
  encryption at rest feature by simply disabling their device passcode. Upon launching, the
  app will attempt to enable encryption at rest by generating encryption keys via the Secure
  Enclave, however it will fail silently if no device passcode is set. The user has no indication
  that encryption at rest is not active since the feature is hidden to them. This issue has
  been resolved in version 3.70
