  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ntfs3: fix uninit memory after failed mi_read in mi_format_new

  Fix a KMSAN un-init bug found by syzkaller.

  ntfs_get_bh() expects a buffer from sb_getblk(), that buffer may not be
  uptodate. We do not bring the buffer uptodate before setting it as
  uptodate. If the buffer were to not be uptodate, it could mean adding a
  buffer with un-init data to the mi record. Attempting to load that record
  will trigger KMSAN.

  Avoid this by setting the buffer as uptodate, if it’s not already, by
  overwriting it.
