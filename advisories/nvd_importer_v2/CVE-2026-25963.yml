aliases: []
summary: Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a broken
  authorization check in Fleet’s certificate template deletion API could allow a team administrator
  to delete certificate templates belonging to other teams within the same Fleet instance. Fleet
  supports certificate templates that are scoped to individual teams. In affected versions,
  the batch deletion endpoint validated authorization using a user-supplied team identifier
  but did not verify that the certificate template IDs being deleted actually belonged to that
  team. As a result, a team administrator could delete certificate templates associated with
  other teams, potentially disrupting certificate-based workflows such as device enrollment,
  Wi-Fi authentication, VPN access, or other certificate-dependent configurations for the affected
  teams. This issue does not allow privilege escalation, access to sensitive data, or compromise
  of Fleet’s control plane. Impact is limited to integrity and availability of certificate templates
  across teams. Version 4.80.1 patches the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators
  should restrict access to certificate template management to trusted users and avoid delegating
  team administrator permissions where not strictly required.
