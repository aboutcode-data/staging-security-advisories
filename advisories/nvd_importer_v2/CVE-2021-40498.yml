summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Application for Android
  - versions older than 2108, which allows an attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing
  a service, either by crashing or flooding the service, which can lead to denial of service.
  The vulnerability is related to Android implementation methods that are widely used across
  Android mobile applications, and such methods are embedded into the SAP SuccessFactors mobile
  application. These Android methods begin executing once the user accesses their profile on
  the mobile application. While executing, it can also pick up the activities from other Android
  applications that are running in the background of the users device and are using the same
  types of methods in the application. Such vulnerability can also lead to phishing attacks
  that can be used for staging other types of attacks.
