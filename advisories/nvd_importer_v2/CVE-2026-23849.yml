aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and can
  be used to upload, delete, preview, rename, and edit files. Prior to version 2.55.0, the JSONAuth.
  Auth function contains a logic flaw that allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate valid
  usernames by measuring the response time of the /api/login endpoint. The vulnerability exists
  due to a "short-circuit" evaluation in the authentication logic. When a username is not found
  in the database, the function returns immediately. However, if the username does exist, the
  code proceeds to verify the password using bcrypt (users.CheckPwd), which is a computationally
  expensive operation designed to be slow. This difference in execution path creates a measurable
  timing discrepancy. Version 2.55.0 contains a patch for the issue.
