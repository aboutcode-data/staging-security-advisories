aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Dahua Smart Park Integrated Management
  Platform (also referred to as the Dahua Smart Campus Integrated Management Platform), affecting
  the SOAP-based GIS bitmap upload interface. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers
  to upload arbitrary files to the server via crafted SOAP requests, including executable JSP
  payloads. Successful exploitation may lead to remote code execution (RCE) and full compromise
  of the affected system. The vulnerability is presumed to affect builds released prior to September
  2023 and is said to be remediated in newer versions of the product, though the exact affected
  range remains undefined. Exploitation evidence was first observed by the Shadowserver Foundation
  on 2024-02-15 UTC.
