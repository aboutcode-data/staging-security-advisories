aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in BeyondTrust Privilege Management for Windows through 5.6.
  An attacker can spawn a process with multiple users as part of the security token (prior to
  Avecto elevation). When Avecto elevates the process, it removes the user who is launching
  the process, but not the second user. Therefore this second user still retains access and
  can give permission to the process back to the first user.
