summary: 'Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals, and @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node
  provides common node.js functionalities for TechDocs. In versions of @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node
  prior to 1.13.11 and 1.14.1, when TechDocs is configured with `runIn: local`, a malicious
  actor who can submit or modify a repository''s `mkdocs.yml` file can execute arbitrary Python
  code on the TechDocs build server via MkDocs hooks configuration. @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node
  versions 1.13.11 and 1.14.1 contain a fix. The fix introduces an allowlist of supported MkDocs
  configuration keys. Unsupported configuration keys (including `hooks`) are now removed from
  `mkdocs.yml` before running the generator, with a warning logged to indicate which keys were
  removed. Users of `@techdocs/cli` should also upgrade to the latest version, which includes
  the fixed `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` dependency. Some workarounds are available. Configure
  TechDocs with `runIn: docker` instead of `runIn: local` to provide container isolation, though
  it does not fully mitigate the risk. Limit who can modify `mkdocs.yml` files in repositories
  that TechDocs processes; only allow trusted contributors. Implement PR review requirements
  for changes to `mkdocs.yml` files to detect malicious `hooks` configurations before they are
  merged. Use MkDocs < 1.4.0 (e.g., 1.3.1) which does not support hooks. Note: This may limit
  access to newer MkDocs features. Building documentation in CI/CD pipelines using `@techdocs/cli`
  does not mitigate this vulnerability, as the CLI uses the same vulnerable `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node`
  package.'
