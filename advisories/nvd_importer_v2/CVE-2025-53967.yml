aliases: []
summary: Framelink Figma MCP Server before 0.6.3 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary operating system commands via a crafted HTTP POST request with shell metacharacters
  in input that is used by a fetchWithRetry curl command. The vulnerable endpoint fails to properly
  sanitize user-supplied input, enabling the attacker to inject malicious commands that are
  executed with the privileges of the MCP process. Exploitation requires network access to the
  MCP interface.
