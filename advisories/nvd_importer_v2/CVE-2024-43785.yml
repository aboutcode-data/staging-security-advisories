aliases: []
summary: gitoxide An idiomatic, lean, fast & safe pure Rust implementation of Git. gitoxide-core,
  which provides most underlying functionality of the gix and ein commands, does not neutralize
  newlines, backspaces, or control characters—including those that form ANSI escape sequences—that
  appear in a repository's paths, author and committer names, commit messages, or other metadata.
  Such text may be written as part of the output of a command, as well as appearing in error
  messages when an operation fails. This sometimes allows an untrusted repository to misrepresent
  its contents and to alter or concoct error messages.
