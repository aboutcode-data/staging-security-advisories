aliases: []
summary: /SecurityManagement/html/createuser.jsf in Nokia NetAct 22 allows CSRF. A remote attacker
  is able to create users with arbitrary privileges, even administrative privileges. The application
  (even if it implements a CSRF token for the random GET request) does not ever verify a CSRF
  token. With a little help of social engineering/phishing (such as sending a link via email
  or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the
  attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the
  user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address,
  and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web
  application.
