  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vsock: fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()

  Syzbot reported a potential lock inversion deadlock between
  vsock_register_mutex and sk_lock-AF_VSOCK when vsock_linger() is called.

  The issue was introduced by commit 687aa0c5581b ("vsock: Fix
  transport_* TOCTOU") which added vsock_register_mutex locking in
  vsock_assign_transport() around the transport->release() call, that can
  call vsock_linger(). vsock_assign_transport() can be called with sk_lock
  held. vsock_linger() calls sk_wait_event() that temporarily releases and
  re-acquires sk_lock. During this window, if another thread hold
  vsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular
  dependency is created.

  Fix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling
  transport->release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe
  because we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the
  old transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by
  obtaining a module reference first via try_module_get().
