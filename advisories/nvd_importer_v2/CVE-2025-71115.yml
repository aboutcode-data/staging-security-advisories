summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  um: init cpu_tasks[] earlier

  This is currently done in uml_finishsetup(), but e.g. with
  KCOV enabled we'll crash because some init code can call
  into e.g. memparse(), which has coverage annotations, and
  then the checks in check_kcov_mode() crash because current
  is NULL.

  Simply initialize the cpu_tasks[] array statically, which
  fixes the crash. For the later SMP work, it seems to have
  not really caused any problems yet, but initialize all of
  the entries anyway.
