aliases: []
summary: Net Monitor for Employees Pro through 5.3.4 has an unquoted service path, which allows
  a Security Feature Bypass of its documented "Block applications" design goal. The local attacker
  must have privileges to write to program.exe in a protected directory, such as the %SYSTEMDRIVE%
  directory, and thus the issue is not interpreted as a direct privilege escalation. However,
  the local attacker might have the goal of executing program.exe even though program.exe is
  a blocked application.
