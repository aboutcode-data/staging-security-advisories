summary: Finit provides fast init for Linux systems. Finit's urandom plugin has a heap buffer
  overwrite vulnerability at boot which leads to it overwriting other parts of the heap, possibly
  causing random instabilities and undefined behavior. The urandom plugin is enabled by default,
  so this bug affects everyone using Finit 4.2 or later that do not explicitly disable the plugin
  at build time. This bug is fixed in Finit 4.12. Those who cannot upgrade or backport the fix
  to urandom.c are strongly recommended to disable the plugin in the call to the `configure`
  script.
