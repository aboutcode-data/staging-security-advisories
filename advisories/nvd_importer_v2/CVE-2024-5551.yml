summary: The WP STAGING Pro WordPress Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the 'sub' parameter called from the WP STAGING WordPress Backup Plugin

  to include any local files that end in '-settings.php' via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
