aliases: []
summary: OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel, is a vendor-neutral open source Observability framework
  for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics,
  and logs. The bearertokenauth extension's server authenticator performs a simple, non-constant
  time string comparison of the received & configured bearer tokens. This impacts anyone using
  the `bearertokenauth` server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector
  may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured
  token, by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This would allow an
  attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline. The
  observable timing vulnerability was fixed by using constant-time comparison in  0.107.0
