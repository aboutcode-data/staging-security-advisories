aliases: []
summary: gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. During checkout, `gix-worktree-state`
  does not verify that paths point to locations in the working tree. A specially crafted repository
  can, when cloned, place new files anywhere writable by the application. This vulnerability
  leads to a major loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but creating files
  outside a working tree without attempting to execute code can directly impact integrity as
  well. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 0.36.0.
