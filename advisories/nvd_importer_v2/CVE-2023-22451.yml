aliases: []
summary: Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when
  users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which
  would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing
  defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the
  password can’t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters,
  can’t be a commonly used password, and can’t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator
  may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.
