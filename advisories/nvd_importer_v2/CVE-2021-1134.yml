aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) integration feature of
  the Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized
  access to sensitive data. The vulnerability is due to an incomplete validation of the X.509
  certificate used when establishing a connection between DNA Center and an ISE server. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted certificate and could then intercept
  communications between the ISE and DNA Center. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to view and alter sensitive information that the ISE maintains about clients that are connected
  to the network.
