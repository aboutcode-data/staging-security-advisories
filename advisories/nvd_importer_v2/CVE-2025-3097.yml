summary: The wp Time Machine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'wpTimeMachineCore.php' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can
  trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
