  drm/amdgpu: fix gpu page fault after hibernation on PF passthrough

  On PF passthrough environment, after hibernate and then resume, coralgemm
  will cause gpu page fault.

  Mode1 reset happens during hibernate, but partition mode is not restored
  on resume, register mmCP_HYP_XCP_CTL and mmCP_PSP_XCP_CTL is not right
  after resume. When CP access the MQD BO, wrong stride size is used,
  this will cause out of bound access on the MQD BO, resulting page fault.

  The fix is to ensure gfx_v9_4_3_switch_compute_partition() is called
  when resume from a hibernation.
  KFD resume is called separately during a reset recovery or resume from
  suspend sequence. Hence it's not required to be called as part of
  partition switch.

  (cherry picked from commit 5d1b32cfe4a676fe552416cb5ae847b215463a1a)
