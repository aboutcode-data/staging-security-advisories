summary: 'Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx Network Recording
  Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by providing a user with a malicious ARF file via email or URL and convincing the user to
  launch the file. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash
  and, in some cases, could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user.
  The Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player is an application that is used to play back WebEx
  meeting recordings that have been recorded on the computer of an online meeting attendee.
  The player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is
  hosted on a WebEx server. The following client builds are affected by this vulnerability:
  Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS29) client builds prior to T29.13.130, Cisco WebEx Business
  Suite (WBS30) client builds prior to T30.17, Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds
