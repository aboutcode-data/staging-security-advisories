aliases: []
summary: The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.11 did not properly
  check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user, allowing an attacker
  to send an arbitrary reset password email to a registered user on behalf of the WordPress
  site. Such issue could be chained with an open redirect (CVE-2021-24358) in version below
  4.1.10, to include a crafted password reset link in the email, which would lead to an account
  takeover.
