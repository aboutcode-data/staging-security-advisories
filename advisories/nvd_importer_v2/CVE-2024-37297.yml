aliases: []
summary: WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform built on WordPress. A vulnerability
  introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site scripting. A bad actor can manipulate
  a link to include malicious HTML & JavaScript content. While the content is not saved to the
  database, the links may be sent to victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript
  could hijack content & data stored in the browser, including the session. The URL content
  is read through the `Sourcebuster.js` library and then inserted without proper sanitization
  to the classic checkout and registration forms. Versions 8.8.5 and 8.9.3 contain a patch for
  the issue. As a workaround, one may disable the Order Attribution feature.
