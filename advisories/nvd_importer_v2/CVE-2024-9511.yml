aliases: []
summary: The FluentSMTP – WP SMTP Plugin with Amazon SES, SendGrid, MailGun, Postmark, Google
  and Any SMTP Provider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.2.82 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'formatResult'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No
  known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional
  plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
  files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. The vulnerability was partially patched in
  version 2.2.82.
