summary: The Testimonial Post type plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the ‘auto_play’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
