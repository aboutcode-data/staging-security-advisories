datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13824
aliases: []
summary: The CiyaShop - Multipurpose WooCommerce Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to
  PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.19.0 via deserialization of untrusted
  input in the 'add_ciyashop_wishlist' and 'ciyashop_get_compare' functions. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the
  vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or
  theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional
  plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions
  like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP
  chain present.
