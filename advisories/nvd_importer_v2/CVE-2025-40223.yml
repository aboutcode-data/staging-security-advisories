  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  most: usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect

  hdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually
  unregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev).
  If that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()
  immediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.

  The old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in
  hdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.
  Depending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or
  double-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also
  performed puts).

  Fix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),
  so they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by
  dropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are
  redundant after device_unregister() and most_deregister_interface().

  This addresses the KASAN slab-use-after-free reported by syzbot in
  hdm_disconnect(). See report and stack traces in the bug link below.
