aliases: []
summary: Frigate is a network video recorder (NVR) with realtime local object detection for
  IP cameras. Prior to 0.16.2, Frigate's export workflow allows an authenticated operator to
  nominate any filesystem location as the thumbnail source for a video export. Because that
  path is copied verbatim into the publicly served clips directory, the feature can be abused
  to read arbitrary files that reside on the host running Frigate. In practice, a low-privilege
  user with API access can pivot from viewing camera footage to exfiltrating sensitive configuration
  files, secrets, or user data from the appliance itself. This behavior violates the principle
  of least privilege for the export subsystem and turns a convenience feature into a direct
  information disclosure vector, with exploitation hinging on a short race window while the
  background exporter copies the chosen file into place before cleanup runs. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.16.2.
