aliases: []
summary: The GameDriverX64.sys kernel-mode anti-cheat driver (v7.23.4.7 and earlier) contains
  an access control vulnerability in one of its IOCTL handlers. A user-mode process can open
  a handle to the driver device and send specially crafted IOCTL requests. These requests are
  executed in kernel-mode context without proper authentication or access validation, allowing
  the attacker to terminate arbitrary processes, including critical system and security services,
  without requiring administrative privileges.
