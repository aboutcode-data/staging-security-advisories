aliases: []
summary: XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8
  and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas
  with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there
  is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing.
  This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious
  scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights
  edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability
  of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.
