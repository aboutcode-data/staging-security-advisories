summary: 'An improper restriction of XML external entity (XXE) reference vulnerability in the
  Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS web interface enables an authenticated administrator to read any

  that causes the service to crash. Repeated attempts to send this request result in denial
  of service to all PAN-OS services by restarting the device and putting it into maintenance
  mode. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.20; PAN-OS 9.0 versions
  earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.10; PAN-OS 10.0 versions
