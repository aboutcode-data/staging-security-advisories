  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Add preempt_count_{sub,add} into btf id deny list

  The recursion check in __bpf_prog_enter* and __bpf_prog_exit*
  leave preempt_count_{sub,add} unprotected. When attaching trampoline to
  them we get panic as follows,

  That is because in __bpf_prog_exit_recur, the preempt_count_{sub,add} are
  called after prog->active is decreased.

  Fixing this by adding these two functions into btf ids deny list.
