aliases: []
summary: The client in OpenText Archive Center Administration through 21.2 allows XXE attacks.
  Authenticated users of the OpenText Archive Center Administration client (Versions 16.2.3,
  21.2, and older versions) could upload XML files to the application that it did not sufficiently
  validate. As a result, attackers could craft XML files that, when processed by the application,
  would cause a negative security impact such as data exfiltration or localized denial of service
  against the application instance and system of the user running it.
