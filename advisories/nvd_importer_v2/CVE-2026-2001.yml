summary: The WowRevenue plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation
  due to a missing capability check in the 'Notice::install_activate_plugin' function in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
