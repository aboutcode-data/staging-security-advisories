aliases: []
summary: The TITLE ANIMATOR plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  settings page form handler in `inc/settings-page.php`. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
