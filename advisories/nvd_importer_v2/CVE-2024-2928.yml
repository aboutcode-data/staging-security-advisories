aliases: []
summary: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in mlflow/mlflow, specifically
  in version 2.9.2, which was fixed in version 2.11.3. This vulnerability arises from the application's
  failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../'.
  An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary
  files on the local file system, including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability
  is a bypass to a previous patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's
  query string, highlighting the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to
  prevent LFI attacks.
