summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vhost: Take a reference on the task in struct vhost_task.

  vhost_task_create() creates a task and keeps a reference to its
  task_struct. That task may exit early via a signal and its task_struct
  will be released.
  A pending vhost_task_wake() will then attempt to wake the task and
  access a task_struct which is no longer there.

  Acquire a reference on the task_struct while creating the thread and
  release the reference while the struct vhost_task itself is removed.
  If the task exits early due to a signal, then the vhost_task_wake() will
  still access a valid task_struct. The wake is safe and will be skipped
  in this case.
