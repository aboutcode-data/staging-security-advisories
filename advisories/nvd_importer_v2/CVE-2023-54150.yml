  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd: Fix an out of bounds error in BIOS parser

  The array is hardcoded to 8 in atomfirmware.h, but firmware provides
  a bigger one sometimes. Deferencing the larger array causes an out
  of bounds error.

  commit 4fc1ba4aa589 ("drm/amd/display: fix array index out of bound error
  in bios parser") fixed some of this, but there are two other cases
  not covered by it.  Fix those as well.
