aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0. It employs caching of std::shared_ptr
  values, using the raw pointer address as a unique identifier. This becomes problematic if
  an std::shared_ptr variable goes out of scope and is freed, and a new std::shared_ptr is allocated
  at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes dependent upon memory layout.
  In short, serialized std::shared_ptr variables cannot always be expected to serialize back
  into their original values. This can have any number of consequences, depending on the context
  within which this manifests.
