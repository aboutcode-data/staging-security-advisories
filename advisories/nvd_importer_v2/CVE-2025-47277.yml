aliases: []
summary: vLLM, an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs), has an issue
  in versions 0.6.5 through 0.8.4 that ONLY impacts environments using the `PyNcclPipe` KV cache
  transfer integration with the V0 engine. No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports
  the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data
  transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented
  through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled
  via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​ The intention was that this interface
  should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip`
  CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network.
  The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens
  on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only
  used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore`
  instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits
  the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured.
