aliases: []
summary: vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly
  known as bitwarden_rs. Attacker with authenticated access to the vaultwarden admin panel can
  execute arbitrary code in the system. The attacker could then change some settings to use
  sendmail as mail agent but adjust the settings in such a way that it would use a shell command.
  It then also needed to craft a special favicon image which would have the commands embedded
  to run during for example sending a test email. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.33.0.
