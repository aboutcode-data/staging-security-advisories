  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: phy: isp1301: fix non-OF device reference imbalance

  A recent change fixing a device reference leak in a UDC driver
  introduced a potential use-after-free in the non-OF case as the
  isp1301_get_client() helper only increases the reference count for the
  returned I2C device in the OF case.

  Increment the reference count also for non-OF so that the caller can
  decrement it unconditionally.

  Note that this is inherently racy just as using the returned I2C device
  is since nothing is preventing the PHY driver from being unbound while
  in use.
