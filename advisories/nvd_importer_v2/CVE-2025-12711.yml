summary: The Share to Google Classroom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the share_to_google shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due

  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
