summary: Zed, a code editor, has an aribtrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior
  to 0.218.2-pre. The Zed IDE loads Language Server Protocol (LSP) configurations from the `settings.json`
  file located within a project’s `.zed` subdirectory. A malicious LSP configuration can contain
  arbitrary shell commands that run on the host system with the privileges of the user running
  the IDE. This can be triggered when a user opens project file for which there is an LSP entry.  A
  concerted effort by an attacker to seed a project settings file (`./zed/settings.json`) with
  malicious language server configurations could result in arbitrary code execution with the
  user's privileges if the user opens the project in Zed without reviewing the contents. Version
  0.218.2-pre fixes the issue by implementing worktree trust mechanism. As a workaround, users
  should carefully review the contents of project settings files (`./zed/settings.json`) before
  opening new projects in Zed.
