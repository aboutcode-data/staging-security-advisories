summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/waitid: always prune wait queue entry in io_waitid_wait()

  For a successful return, always remove our entry from the wait queue
  entry list. Previously this was skipped if a cancelation was in
  progress, but this can race with another invocation of the wait queue
  entry callback.
