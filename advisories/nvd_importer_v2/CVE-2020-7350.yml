summary: 'Rapid7 Metasploit Framework versions before 5.0.85 suffers from an instance of CWE-78:
  OS Command Injection, wherein the libnotify plugin accepts untrusted user-supplied data via
  a remote computer''s hostname or service name. An attacker can create a specially-crafted
  hostname or service name to be imported by Metasploit from a variety of sources and trigger
  a command injection on the operator''s terminal. Note, only the Metasploit Framework and products
  that expose the plugin system is susceptible to this issue -- notably, this does not include
  Rapid7 Metasploit Pro. Also note, this vulnerability cannot be triggered through a normal
  scan operation -- the attacker would have to supply a file that is processed with the db_import
  command.'
