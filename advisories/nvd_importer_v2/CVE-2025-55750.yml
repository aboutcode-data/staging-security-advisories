aliases: []
summary: Gitpod is a developer platform for cloud development environments. In versions before
  main-gha.33628 for both Gitpod Classic and Gitpod Classic Enterprise, OAuth integration with
  Bitbucket in certain conditions allowed a crafted link to expose a valid Bitbucket access
  token via the URL fragment when clicked by an authenticated user. This resulted from how Bitbucket
  returned tokens and how Gitpod handled the redirect flow. The issue was limited to Bitbucket
  (GitHub and GitLab integrations were not affected), required user interaction, and has been
  mitigated through redirect handling and OAuth logic hardening. The issue was resolved in main-gha.33628
  and later. There are no workarounds.
