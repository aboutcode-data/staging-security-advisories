  ALSA: pcm: Fix potential data race at PCM memory allocation helpers

  The PCM memory allocation helpers have a sanity check against too many
  buffer allocations.  However, the check is performed without a proper
  lock and the allocation isn't serialized; this allows user to allocate
  more memories than predefined max size.

  Practically seen, this isn't really a big problem, as it's more or
  less some "soft limit" as a sanity check, and it's not possible to
  allocate unlimitedly.  But it's still better to address this for more
  consistent behavior.

  The patch covers the size check in do_alloc_pages() with the
  card->memory_mutex, and increases the allocated size there for
  preventing the further overflow.  When the actual allocation fails,
  the size is decreased accordingly.
