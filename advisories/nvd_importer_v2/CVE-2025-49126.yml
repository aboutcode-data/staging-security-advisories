aliases: []
summary: Visionatrix is an AI Media processing tool using ComfyUI. In versions 1.5.0 to before
  2.5.1, the /docs/flows endpoint is vulnerable to a Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack
  allowing full takeover of the application and exfiltration of secrets stored in the application.
  The implementation uses the get_swagger_ui_html function from FastAPI. This function does
  not encode or sanitize its arguments before using them to generate the HTML for the swagger
  documentation page and is not intended to be used with user-controlled arguments. Any user
  of this application can be targeted with a one-click attack that can takeover their session
  and all the secrets that may be contained within it. This issue has been patched in version
  2.5.1.
