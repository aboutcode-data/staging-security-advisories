aliases: []
summary: Versions of the Traccar open-source GPS tracking system up to and including 6.11.1
  contain a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability in the `/api/socket` endpoint.
  The application fails to validate the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake. This
  allows a remote attacker to bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP) and establish a full-duplex
  WebSocket connection using a legitimate user's credentials (JSESSIONID). As of time of publication,
  it is unclear whether a fix is available.
