aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Kaseya VSA RMM through 9.5.0.22. When using the default
  configuration, the LAN Cache feature creates a local account FSAdminxxxxxxxxx (e.g., FSAdmin123456789)
  on the server that hosts the LAN Cache and all clients that are assigned to a LAN Cache. This
  account is placed into the local Administrators group of all clients assigned to the LAN Cache.
  When the assigned client is a Domain Controller, the FSAdminxxxxxxxxx account is created as
  a domain account and automatically added as a member of the domain BUILTIN\Administrators
  group. Using the well known Pass-the-Hash techniques, an attacker can use the same FSAdminxxxxxxxxx
  hash from any LAN Cache client and pass this to a Domain Controller, providing administrative
  rights to the attacker on any Domain Controller. (Local account Pass-the-Hash mitigations
  do not protect domain accounts.)
