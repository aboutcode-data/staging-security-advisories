summary: 2FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate
  their security codes. Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and
  URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting
  a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality, it is possible
  to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be
  stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally, the library
  does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an
  image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the
  URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from
  the application, as long as their content type is text based. If not, the request is still
  sent, but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.
