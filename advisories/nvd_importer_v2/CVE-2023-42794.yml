summary: "Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nThe internal fork of Commons\
  \ FileUpload packaged with Apache Tomcat 9.0.70 through 9.0.80 and 8.5.85 through 8.5.93 included\
  \ an unreleased, \nin progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on \n\
  Windows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but \nfailed to close the\
  \ stream. The file would never be deleted from disk \ncreating the possibility of an eventual\
  \ denial of service due to the \ndisk being full.\n\nOther, EOL versions may also be affected.\n\
  \n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes\
  \ the issue."
