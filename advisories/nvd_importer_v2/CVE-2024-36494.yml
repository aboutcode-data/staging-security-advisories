aliases: []
summary: Due to missing input sanitization, an attacker can perform cross-site-scripting attacks
  and run arbitrary Javascript in the browser of other users. The login page at /cgi/slogin.cgi
  suffers from XSS due to improper input filtering of the -tsetup+-uuser parameter, which can
  only be exploited if the target user is not already logged in. This makes it ideal for login
  form phishing attempts.
