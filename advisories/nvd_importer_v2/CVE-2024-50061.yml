  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  i3c: master: cdns: Fix use after free vulnerability in cdns_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition

  In the cdns_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with
  cdns_i3c_master_hj. And cdns_i3c_master_interrupt can call
  cnds_i3c_master_demux_ibis function to start the work.

  If we remove the module which will call cdns_i3c_master_remove to
  make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister
  while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations
  that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

  CPU0                                      CPU1

                                       | cdns_i3c_master_hj
  cdns_i3c_master_remove               |
  i3c_master_unregister(&master->base) |
  device_unregister(&master->dev)      |
  device_release                       |
  //free master->base                  |
                                       | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)
                                       | //use master->base

  Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with
  the cleanup in cdns_i3c_master_remove.
