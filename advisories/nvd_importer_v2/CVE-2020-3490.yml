aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage
  Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to conduct
  directory traversal attacks and obtain read access to sensitive files on an affected system.
  The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate
  user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP
  request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to read files on the underlying operating system with root
  privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative
  privileges on the affected system.
