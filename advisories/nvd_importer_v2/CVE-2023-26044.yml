aliases: []
summary: react/http is an event-driven, streaming HTTP client and server implementation for
  ReactPHP.  Previous versions of ReactPHP's HTTP server component contain a potential DoS vulnerability
  that can cause high CPU load when processing large HTTP request bodies. This vulnerability
  has little to no impact on the default configuration, but can be exploited when explicitly
  using the RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with very large settings. This might lead to consuming
  large amounts of CPU time for processing requests and significantly delay or slow down the
  processing of legitimate user requests. This issue has been addressed in release 1.9.0. Users
  are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may keep the request body limited using RequestBodyBufferMiddleware
  with a sensible value which should mitigate the issue. An infrastructure or DevOps workaround
  could be to place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any excessive
  HTTP request bodies.
