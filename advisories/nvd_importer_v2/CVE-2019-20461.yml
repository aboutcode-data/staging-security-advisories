aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on Alecto IVM-100 2019-11-12 devices. The device uses a custom
  UDP protocol to start and control video and audio services. The protocol has been partially
  reverse engineered. Based upon the reverse engineering, no password or username is ever transferred
  over this protocol. Thus, one can set up the camera connection feed with only the encoded
  UID. It is possible to set up sessions with the camera over the Internet by using the encoded
  UID and the custom UDP protocol, because authentication happens at the client side.
