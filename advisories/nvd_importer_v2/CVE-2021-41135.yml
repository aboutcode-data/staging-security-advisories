aliases: []
summary: The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang. Affected
  versions of the SDK were vulnerable to a consensus halt due to non-deterministic behaviour
  in a ValidateBasic method in the x/authz module. The MsgGrant of the x/authz module contains
  a Grant field which includes a user-defined expiration time for when the authorization grant
  expires. In Grant.ValidateBasic(), that time is compared to the node’s local clock time. Any
  chain running an affected version of the SDK with the authz module enabled could be halted
  by anyone with the ability to send transactions on that chain. Recovery would require applying
  the patch and rolling back the latest block. Users are advised to update to version 0.44.2.
