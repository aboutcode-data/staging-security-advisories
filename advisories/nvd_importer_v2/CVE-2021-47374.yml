aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dma-debug: prevent an error message from causing runtime problems

  For some drivers, that use the DMA API. This error message can be reached
  several millions of times per second, causing spam to the kernel's printk
  buffer and bringing the CPU usage up to 100% (so, it should be rate
  limited). However, since there is at least one driver that is in the
  mainline and suffers from the error condition, it is more useful to
  err_printk() here instead of just rate limiting the error message (in hopes
  that it will make it easier for other drivers that suffer from this issue
  to be spotted).
