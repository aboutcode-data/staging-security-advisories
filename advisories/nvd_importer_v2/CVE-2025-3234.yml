aliases: []
summary: The File Manager Pro – Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file
  uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.8. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above,
  to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible. Administrators have the ability to extend file manager usage privileges to lower-level
  users including subscribers, which would make this vulnerability more severe on such sites.
