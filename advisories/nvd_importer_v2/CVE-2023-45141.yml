aliases: []
summary: Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to obtain
  tokens and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This can lead to unauthorized actions
  being taken on the user's behalf, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the
  application. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens
  within the application. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users
  are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor
  Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the
  Secure and HttpOnly attributes.
