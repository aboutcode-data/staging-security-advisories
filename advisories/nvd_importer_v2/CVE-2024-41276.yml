aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Kaiten version 57.131.12 and earlier allows attackers to bypass
  the PIN code authentication mechanism. The application requires users to input a 6-digit PIN
  code sent to their email for authorization after entering their login credentials. However,
  the request limiting mechanism can be easily bypassed, enabling attackers to perform a brute
  force attack to guess the correct PIN and gain unauthorized access to the application.
