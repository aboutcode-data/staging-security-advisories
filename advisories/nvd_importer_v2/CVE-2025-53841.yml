aliases: []
summary: The GC-AGENTS-SERVICE running as part of Akamai´s Guardicore Platform Agent for Windows
  versions prior to v49.20.1, v50.15.0, v51.12.0, v52.2.0 is affected by a local privilege escalation
  vulnerability. The service will attempt to read an OpenSSL configuration file from a non-existent
  location that standard Windows users have default write access to. This allows an unprivileged
  local user to create a crafted "openssl.cnf" file in that location and, by specifying the
  path to a custom DLL file in a custom OpenSSL engine definition, execute arbitrary commands
  with the privileges of the Guardicore Agent process. Since Guardicore Agent runs with SYSTEM
  privileges, this permits an unprivileged user to fully elevate privileges to SYSTEM level
  in this manner.
