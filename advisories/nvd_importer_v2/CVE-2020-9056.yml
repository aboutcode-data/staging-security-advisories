aliases: []
summary: Periscope BuySpeed version 14.5 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, which
  could allow a local, authenticated attacker to store arbitrary JavaScript within the application.
  This JavaScript is subsequently displayed by the application without sanitization and is executed
  in the browser of the user, which could possibly cause website redirection, session hijacking,
  or information disclosure. This vulnerability has been patched in BuySpeed version 15.3.
