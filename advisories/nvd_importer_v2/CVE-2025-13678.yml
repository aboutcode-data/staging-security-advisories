aliases: []
summary: The Thai Lottery Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the `thailottery` shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the user supplied `width` and `height`
  shortcode attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
