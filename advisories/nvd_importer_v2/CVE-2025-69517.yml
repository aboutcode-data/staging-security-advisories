aliases: []
summary: 'An HTML injection vulnerability in Amidaware Inc Tactical RMM v1.3.1 and earlier allows
  authenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML content during the creation of a new agent via
  the POST /api/v3/newagent/ endpoint. The agent_id parameter accepts up to 255 characters and
  is improperly sanitized using DOMPurify.sanitize() with the html: true option enabled, which
  fails to adequately filter HTML input. The injected HTML is rendered in the Tactical RMM management
  panel when an administrator attempts to remove or shut down the affected agent, potentially
  leading to client-side attacks such as UI manipulation or phishing. NOTE: the Supplier''s
  position is that this has incorrect information.'
