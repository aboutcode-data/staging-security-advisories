summary: Discourse Calendar adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post
  of a topic on the open-source discussion platform Discourse. Prior to version 0.4, event invitees
  created in topics in private categories or PMs (private messages) can be retrieved by anyone,
  even if they're not logged in. This problem is resolved in version 0.4 of the discourse-calendar
  plugin. While no known workaround is available, putting the site behind `login_required` will
  disallow this endpoint to be used by anonymous users, but logged in users can still get the
  list of invitees in the private topics.
