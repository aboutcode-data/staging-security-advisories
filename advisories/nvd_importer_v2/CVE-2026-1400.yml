aliases: []
summary: The AI Engine – The Chatbot and AI Framework for WordPress plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `rest_helpers_update_media_metadata`
  function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible. The attacker can upload a benign image
  file, then use the `update_media_metadata` endpoint to rename it to a PHP file, creating an
  executable PHP file in the uploads directory.
