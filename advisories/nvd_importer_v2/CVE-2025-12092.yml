aliases: []
summary: The CYAN Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to
  insufficient file path validation in the 'delete' functionality in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
  code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
