summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing header

  The driver expects to receive a struct gs_host_frame in
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback().

  Use struct_group to describe the header of the struct gs_host_frame and
  check that we have at least received the header before accessing any
  members of it.

  To resubmit the URB, do not dereference the pointer chain
  "dev->parent->hf_size_rx" but use "parent->hf_size_rx" instead. Since
  "urb->context" contains "parent", it is always defined, while "dev" is not
  defined if the URB it too short.
