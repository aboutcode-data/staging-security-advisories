aliases: []
summary: Manifest offers users a one-file micro back end. Prior to version 4.9.2, Manifest employs
  a weak password hashing implementation that uses SHA3 without a salt. This exposes user passwords
  to a higher risk of being cracked if an attacker gains access to the database. Without the
  use of a salt, identical passwords across multiple users will result in the same hash, making
  it easier for attackers to identify and exploit patterns, thereby accelerating the cracking
  process. Version 4.9.2 fixes the issue.
