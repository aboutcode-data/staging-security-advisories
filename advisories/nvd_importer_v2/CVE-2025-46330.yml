summary: libsnowflakeclient is the Snowflake Connector for C/C++. Versions starting from 0.5.0
  to before 2.2.0, incorrectly treat malformed requests that caused the HTTP response status
  code 400, as able to be retried. This could hang the application until SF_CON_MAX_RETRY requests
  were sent. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.
