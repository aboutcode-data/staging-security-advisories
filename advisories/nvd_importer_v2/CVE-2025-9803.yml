aliases: []
summary: lunary-ai/lunary version 1.9.34 is vulnerable to an account takeover due to improper
  authentication in the Google OAuth integration. The application fails to verify the 'aud'
  (audience) field in the access token issued by Google, which is crucial for ensuring the token
  is intended for the application. This oversight allows attackers to use tokens issued to malicious
  applications to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. The issue is resolved in version
  1.9.35.
