summary: The Droit Elementor Addons – Widgets, Blocks, Templates Library For Elementor Builder
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's widgets
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output

  attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in
  pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
