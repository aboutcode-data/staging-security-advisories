summary: An issue was discovered in ClickHouse before 22.9.1.2603. An attacker could send a
  crafted HTTP request to the HTTP Endpoint (usually listening on port 8123 by default), causing
  a heap-based buffer overflow that crashes the process. This does not require authentication.
  The fixed versions are 22.9.1.2603, 22.8.2.11, 22.7.4.16, 22.6.6.16, and 22.3.12.19.
