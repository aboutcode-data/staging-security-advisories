aliases: []
summary: HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents from constructs
  that can lead to XSS attacks. The vulnerability occurs in configurations where foreign content
  is allowed, i.e. either `svg` or `math` are in the list of allowed elements. In the case an
  application sanitizes user input with a vulnerable configuration, an attacker could bypass
  the sanitization and inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code. Note that in the default
  configuration the vulnerability is not present. The vulnerability has been fixed in versions
  8.0.723 and 8.1.722-beta (preview version).
