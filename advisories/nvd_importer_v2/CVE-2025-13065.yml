aliases: []
summary: The Starter Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in
  all versions up to, and including, 4.4.41. This is due to insufficient file type validation
  detecting WXR files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted
  as a valid WXR file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
