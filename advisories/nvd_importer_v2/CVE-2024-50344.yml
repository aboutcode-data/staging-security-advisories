aliases: []
summary: I, Librarian is an open-source version of a PDF managing SaaS. Supplemental Files are
  allowed to be viewed in the browser, only if they have a white-listed MIME type. Unfortunately,
  this logic is broken, thus allowing unsafe files containing Javascript to be executed with
  the application context. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a supplementary
  file that contains a malicious code or script. This code will then be executed when the file
  is loaded in the browser. The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.11.2.
