summary: The WooCommerce Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ajax_manage_file_chunk_upload() function

  to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible.
