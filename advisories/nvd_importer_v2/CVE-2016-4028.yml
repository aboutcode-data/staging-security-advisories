aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX Guard before 2.4.0-rev8. OX Guard uses an
  authentication token to identify and transfer guest users' credentials.  The OX Guard API
  acts as a padding oracle by responding with different error codes depending on whether the
  provided token matches the encryption padding.  In combination with AES-CBC, this allows attackers
  to guess the correct padding.  Attackers may run brute-forcing attacks on the content of the
  guest authentication token and discover user credentials.  For a practical attack vector,
  the guest users needs to have logged in, the content of the guest user's "OxReaderID" cookie
  and the value of the "auth" parameter needs to be known to the attacker.
