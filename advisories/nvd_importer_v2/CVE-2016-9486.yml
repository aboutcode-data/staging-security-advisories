aliases: []
summary: On Windows endpoints, the SecureConnector agent must run under the local SYSTEM account
  or another administrator account in order to enable full functionality of the agent. The typical
  configuration is for the agent to run as a Windows service under the local SYSTEM account.
  The SecureConnector agent runs various plugin scripts and executables on the endpoint in order
  to gather and report information about the host to the CounterACT management appliance. The
  SecureConnector agent downloads these scripts and executables as needed from the CounterACT
  management appliance and runs them on the endpoint. By default, these executable files are
  downloaded to and run from the %TEMP% directory of the currently logged on user, despite the
  fact that the SecureConnector agent is running as SYSTEM. Aside from the downloaded scripts,
  the SecureConnector agent runs a batch file with SYSTEM privileges from the temp directory
  of the currently logged on user. If the naming convention of this script can be derived, which
  is made possible by placing it in a directory to which the user has read access, it may be
  possible overwrite the legitimate batch file with a malicious one before SecureConnector executes
  it. It is possible to change this directory by setting the the configuration property config.script_run_folder.value
  in the local.properties configuration file on the CounterACT management appliance, however
  the batch file which is run does not follow this property.
