aliases: []
summary: Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other
  apps. Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued
  by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior
  to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious
  website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the
  process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining
  access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this
  issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
