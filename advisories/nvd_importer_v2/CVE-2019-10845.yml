aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14. When entering new credentials
  to a site that isn't registered within this product, a pop-up window will appear asking the
  user if they want to save these new credentials. The code of the pop-up window can be read
  and, to some extent, manipulated by remote servers. This pop-up window will stay on any page
  the user visits within the browser until a decision is made. A malicious web server can forcefully
  manipulate the pop-up and cause it not to appear, stopping users from securing their credentials.
  This vulnerability is related to id="uniqkey-password-popup" and password-popup/popup.html,
  but is a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-10676.
