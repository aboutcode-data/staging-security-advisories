aliases: []
summary: PostgreSQL Anonymizer contains a vulnerability that allows a user to gain superuser
  privileges by creating a temporary view based on a function containing malicious code. When
  the anon.get_tablesample_ratio function is then called, the malicious code is executed with
  superuser privileges. This privilege elevation can be exploited by users having the CREATE
  privilege in PostgreSQL 15 and later. The risk is higher with PostgreSQL 14 or with instances
  upgraded from PostgreSQL 14 or a prior version because the creation permission on the public
  schema is granted by default. The problem is resolved in PostgreSQL Anonymizer 3.0.1 and further
  versions
