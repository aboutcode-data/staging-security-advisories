aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange Guard before 2.2.0-rev8. The "getprivkeybyid"
  API call is used to download a PGP Private Key for a specific user after providing authentication
  credentials. Clients provide the "id" and "cid" parameter to specify the current user by its
  user- and context-ID. The "auth" parameter contains a hashed password string which gets created
  by the client by asking the user to enter his or her OX Guard password. This parameter is
  used as single point of authentication when accessing PGP Private Keys. In case a user has
  set the same password as another user, it is possible to download another user's PGP Private
  Key by iterating the "id" and "cid" parameters. This kind of attack would also be able by
  brute-forcing login credentials, but since the "id" and "cid" parameters are sequential they
  are much easier to predict than a user's login name. At the same time, there are some obvious
  insecure standard passwords that are widely used. A attacker could send the hashed representation
  of typically weak passwords and randomly fetch Private Key of matching accounts. The attack
  can be executed by both internal users and "guests" which use the external mail reader.
