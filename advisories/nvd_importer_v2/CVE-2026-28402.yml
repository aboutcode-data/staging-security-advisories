aliases: []
summary: nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol
  based on the Albatross consensus algorithm. Prior to version 1.2.2, a malicious or compromised
  validator that is elected as proposer can publish a macro block proposal where `header.body_root`
  does not match the actual macro body hash. The proposal can pass proposal verification because
  the macro proposal verification path validates the header but does not validate the binding
  `body_root == hash(body)`; later code expects this binding and may panic on mismatch, crashing
  validators. Note that the impact is only for validator nodes. The patch for this vulnerability
  is formally released as part of v1.2.2. The patch adds the corresponding body root verification
  in the proposal checks. No known workarounds are available.
