summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper
  validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially
  crafted messages that contain Universal Naming Convention (UNC) links to a targeted user and
  convincing the user to follow the provided link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the application to access a remote system, possibly allowing the attacker to gain
  access to sensitive information that the attacker could use in additional attacks.
