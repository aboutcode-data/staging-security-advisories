summary: Cloudflare quiche was discovered to be vulnerable to unbounded storage of information
  related to connection ID retirement, which could lead to excessive resource consumption. Each
  QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see  RFC 9000 Section 5.1
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of
  active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active_connection_id_limit transport
  parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within
  the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID
  includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame
  as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending
  NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion
  window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they
  are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded
  queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem. There is
  no workaround for affected versions.
