aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary application,
  specifically within the endpoint '/auth/saml/tto/download-idp-xml'. The vulnerability arises
  due to the application's failure to validate user-supplied URLs before using them in server-side
  requests. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request
  to the affected endpoint, allowing them to make unauthorized requests to internal or external
  resources. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, service disruption,
  or further attacks against the network infrastructure. The issue affects the latest version
  of the application as of the report.
