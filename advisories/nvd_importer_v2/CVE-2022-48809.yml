  net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata

  When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata, a new
  dst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb.
  This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific
  skb.

  The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of
  1, which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. When
  tun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from a
  single place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never
  drop to 0 (when the skb is consumed), leading to a memory leak.

  Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as the
  dst+metadata refcount is already 1.
