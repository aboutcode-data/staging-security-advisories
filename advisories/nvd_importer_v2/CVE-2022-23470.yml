aliases: []
summary: Galaxy is an open-source platform for data analysis. An arbitrary file read exists
  in Galaxy 22.01 and Galaxy 22.05 due to the switch to Gunicorn, which can be used to read
  any file accessible to the operating system user under which Galaxy is running. This vulnerability
  affects Galaxy 22.01 and higher, after the switch to gunicorn, which serve static contents
  directly.  Additionally, the vulnerability is mitigated when using Nginx or Apache to serve
  /static/* contents, instead of Galaxy's internal middleware. This issue has been patched in
  commit `e5e6bda4f` and will be included in future releases. Users are advised to manually
  patch their installations. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
