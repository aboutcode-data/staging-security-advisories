aliases: []
summary: Apache VCL versions 2.1 through 2.5 do not properly validate cookie input when determining
  what node (if any) was previously selected in the privilege tree. The cookie data is then
  used in an SQL statement. This allows for an SQL injection attack. Access to this portion
  of a VCL system requires admin level rights. Other layers of security seem to protect against
  malicious attack. However, all VCL systems running versions earlier than 2.5.1 should be upgraded
  or patched. This vulnerability was found and reported to the Apache VCL project by ADLab of
  Venustech.
