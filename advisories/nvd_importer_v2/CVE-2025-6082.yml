aliases: []
summary: The Birth Chart Compatibility plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to insufficient protection against
  directly accessing the plugin's index.php file, which causes an error exposing the full path.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web
  application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful
  on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
