summary: A vulnerability exists in NeuVector versions up to and including 5.4.5, where a fixed
  string is used as the default password for the built-in `admin` account. If this password
  is not changed immediately after deployment, any workload with network access within the cluster
  could use the default credentials to obtain an authentication token. This token can then be
  used to perform any operation via NeuVector APIs.
