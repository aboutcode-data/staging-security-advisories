  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: hns3: add VLAN id validation before using

  Currently, the VLAN id may be used without validation when
  receive a VLAN configuration mailbox from VF. The length of
  vlan_del_fail_bmap is BITS_TO_LONGS(VLAN_N_VID). It may cause
  out-of-bounds memory access once the VLAN id is bigger than
  or equal to VLAN_N_VID.

  Therefore, VLAN id needs to be checked to ensure it is within
  the range of VLAN_N_VID.
