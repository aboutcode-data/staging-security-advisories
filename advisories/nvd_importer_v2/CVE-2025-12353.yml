summary: The WPFunnels – The Easiest Funnel Builder For WordPress And WooCommerce To Collect
  Leads And Increase Sales plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user registration
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.2. This is due to the plugin relying on a user controlled
  value 'optin_allow_registration' to determine if user registration is allowed, instead of
  the site-specific setting. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register
  new user accounts, even when user registration is disabled.
