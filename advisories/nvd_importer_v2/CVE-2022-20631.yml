summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;ECE could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface\
  \ of an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface\
  \ does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by inserting malicious script code in a chat window. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker\
  \ to access sensitive browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that\
  \ address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
