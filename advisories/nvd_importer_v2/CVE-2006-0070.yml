aliases: []
summary: 'Drupal allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an
  IMG tag with an unusual encoded Javascript function name, as demonstrated using variations
  of the alert() function.  NOTE: a followup by the vendor suggests that the issue does not
  exist in 4.5.6 or 4.6.4 when "Filtered HTML" is enabled, and since "Full HTML" would not filter
  HTML by design, perhaps this should not be included in CVE'
