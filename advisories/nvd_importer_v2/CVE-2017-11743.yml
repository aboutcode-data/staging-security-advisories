aliases: []
summary: MEDHOST Connex contains a hard-coded Mirth Connect admin credential that is used for
  customer Mirth Connect management access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credential
  and the ability to communicate directly with the Mirth Connect management console may be able
  to intercept sensitive patient information. The admin account password is hard-coded as $K8t1ng
  throughout the application, and is the same across all installations. Customers do not have
  the option to change the Mirth Connect admin account password. The Mirth Connect admin account
  is created during the Connex install. The plaintext account password is hard-coded multiple
  times in the Connex install and update scripts.
