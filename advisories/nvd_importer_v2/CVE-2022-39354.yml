aliases: []
summary: SputnikVM, also called evm, is a Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. A
  custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if the call is executed
  in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide if stateful operations should be done.
  Prior to version 0.36.0, the passed `is_static` parameter was incorrect -- it was only set
  to `true` if the call came from a direct `STATICCALL` opcode. However, once a static call
  context is entered, it should stay static. The issue only impacts custom precompiles that
  actually uses `is_static`. For those affected, the issue can lead to possible incorrect state
  transitions. Version 0.36.0 contains a patch. There are no known workarounds.
