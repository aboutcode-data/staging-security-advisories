aliases: []
summary: The SVG Support plugin for WordPress defaults to insecure settings in version 2.5 and
  2.5.1. SVG files containing malicious javascript are not sanitized. While version 2.5 adds
  the ability to sanitize image as they are uploaded, the plugin defaults to disable sanitization
  and does not restrict SVG upload to only administrators. This allows authenticated attackers,
  with author-level privileges and higher, to upload malicious SVG files that can be embedded
  in posts and pages by higher privileged users. Additionally, the embedded JavaScript is also
  triggered on visiting the image URL, which allows an attacker to execute malicious code in
  browsers visiting that URL.
