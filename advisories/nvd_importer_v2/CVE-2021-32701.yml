summary: 'ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API
  that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an
  endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope,
  introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second
  requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired.
  Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch
  will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection`
  authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked
  in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152).
  From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97)
  it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has
  or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed
  to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the
  vulnerability passed the review process.'
