aliases: []
summary: SoftVision webPDF before 10.0.2 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
  The PDF converter function does not check if internal or external resources are requested
  in the uploaded files and allows for protocols such as http:// and file:///. This allows an
  attacker to upload an XML or HTML file in the application, which when rendered to a PDF allows
  for internal port scanning and Local File Inclusion (LFI).
