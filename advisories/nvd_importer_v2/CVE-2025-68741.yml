  scsi: qla2xxx: Fix improper freeing of purex item

  In qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb(), an item is allocated via
  qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), which internally calls
  qla24xx_alloc_purex_item().

  The qla24xx_alloc_purex_item() function may return a pre-allocated item
  from a per-adapter pool for small allocations, instead of dynamically
  allocating memory with kzalloc().

  An error handling path in qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb() incorrectly uses
  kfree() to release the item. If the item was from the pre-allocated
  pool, calling kfree() on it is a bug that can lead to memory corruption.

  Fix this by using the correct deallocation function,
  qla24xx_free_purex_item(), which properly handles both dynamically
  allocated and pre-allocated items.
