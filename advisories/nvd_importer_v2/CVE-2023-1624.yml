aliases: []
summary: The WPCode WordPress plugin before 2.0.9 has a flawed CSRF when deleting log, and does
  not ensure that the file to be deleted is inside the expected folder. This could allow attackers
  to make users with the wpcode_activate_snippets capability delete arbitrary log files on the
  server, including outside of the blog folders
