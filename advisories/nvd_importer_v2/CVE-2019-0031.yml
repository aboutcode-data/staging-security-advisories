aliases: []
summary: 'Specific IPv6 DHCP packets received by the jdhcpd daemon will cause a memory resource
  consumption issue to occur on a Junos OS device using the jdhcpd daemon configured to respond
  to IPv6 requests. Once started, memory consumption will eventually impact any IPv4 or IPv6
  request serviced by the jdhcpd daemon, thus creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition to
  clients requesting and not receiving IP addresses. Additionally, some clients which were previously
  holding IPv6 addresses will not have their IPv6 Identity Association (IA) address and network
  tables agreed upon by the jdhcpd daemon after the failover event occurs, which leads to more
  than one interface, and multiple IP addresses, being denied on the client. Affected releases
  are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2.'
