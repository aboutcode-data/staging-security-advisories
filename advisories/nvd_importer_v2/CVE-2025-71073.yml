aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Input: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device

  lkkbd_interrupt() schedules lk->tq via schedule_work(), and the work
  handler lkkbd_reinit() dereferences the lkkbd structure and its
  serio/input_dev fields.

  lkkbd_disconnect() and error paths in lkkbd_connect() free the lkkbd
  structure without preventing the reinit work from being queued again
  until serio_close() returns. This can allow the work handler to run
  after the structure has been freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.

  Use disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() to ensure the
  reinit work cannot be re-queued, and call it both in lkkbd_disconnect()
  and in lkkbd_connect() error paths after serio_open().
