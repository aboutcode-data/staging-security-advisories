aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in DTEX DEC-M (DTEX Forwarder) 6.1.1. The com.dtexsystems.helper
  service, responsible for handling privileged operations within the macOS DTEX Event Forwarder
  agent, fails to implement critical client validation during XPC interprocess communication
  (IPC). Specifically, the service does not verify the code requirements, entitlements, security
  flags, or version of any client attempting to establish a connection. This lack of proper
  logic validation allows malicious actors to exploit the service's methods via unauthorized
  client connections, and escalate privileges to root by abusing the DTConnectionHelperProtocol
  protocol's submitQuery method over an unauthorized XPC connection.
