aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application
  Delivery Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based
  management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected
  interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
