aliases: []
summary: The ScrollTo Bottom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to missing nonce
  validation and missing file type validation in the 'options_page' function. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
