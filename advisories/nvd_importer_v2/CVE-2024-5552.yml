summary: kubeflow/kubeflow is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack
  due to inefficient regular expression complexity in its email validation mechanism. An attacker
  can remotely exploit this vulnerability without authentication by providing specially crafted

  affects the latest version of kubeflow/kubeflow, specifically within the centraldashboard-angular
  backend component. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability includes resource exhaustion,
  and service disruption.
