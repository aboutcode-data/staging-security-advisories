  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommu/amd: Fix potential out-of-bounds read in iommu_mmio_show

  In iommu_mmio_write(), it validates the user-provided offset with the
  check: `iommu->dbg_mmio_offset > iommu->mmio_phys_end - 4`.
  This assumes a 4-byte access. However, the corresponding
  show handler, iommu_mmio_show(), uses readq() to perform an 8-byte
  (64-bit) read.

  If a user provides an offset equal to `mmio_phys_end - 4`, the check
  passes, and will lead to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read.

  Fix this by adjusting the boundary check to use sizeof(u64), which
  corresponds to the size of the readq() operation.
