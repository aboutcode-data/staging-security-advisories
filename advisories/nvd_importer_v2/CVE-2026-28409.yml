summary: WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to version 3.6.5, a critical
  Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the WeGIA application's database restoration

  reported Authentication Bypass) can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server by uploading
  a backup file with a specifically crafted filename. Version 3.6.5 fixes the issue.
