  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: qla2xxx: Sanitize payload size to prevent member overflow

  In qla27xx_copy_fpin_pkt() and qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), the frame_size
  reported by firmware is used to calculate the copy length into
  item->iocb. However, the iocb member is defined as a fixed-size 64-byte
  array within struct purex_item.

  If the reported frame_size exceeds 64 bytes, subsequent memcpy calls will
  overflow the iocb member boundary. While extra memory might be allocated,
  this cross-member write is unsafe and triggers warnings under
  CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

  Fix this by capping total_bytes to the size of the iocb member (64 bytes)
  before allocation and copying. This ensures all copies remain within the
  bounds of the destination structure member.
