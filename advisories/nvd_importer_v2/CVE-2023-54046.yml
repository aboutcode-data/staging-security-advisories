summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: essiv - Handle EBUSY correctly

  As it is essiv only handles the special return value of EINPROGERSS,
  which means that in all other cases it will free data related to the
  request.

  However, as the caller of essiv may specify MAY_BACKLOG, we also need
  to expect EBUSY and treat it in the same way.  Otherwise backlogged
  requests will trigger a use-after-free.
