  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/rockchip: dw_hdmi: cleanup drm encoder during unbind

  This fixes a use-after-free crash during rmmod.

  The DRM encoder is embedded inside the larger rockchip_hdmi,
  which is allocated with the component. The component memory
  gets freed before the main drm device is destroyed. Fix it
  by running encoder cleanup before tearing down its container.

  [moved encoder cleanup above clk_disable, similar to bind-error-path]
