aliases: []
summary: Ray is an AI compute engine. Prior to version 2.52.0, developers working with Ray as
  a development tool can be exploited via a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox
  and Safari. This vulnerability is due to an insufficient guard against browser-based attacks,
  as the current defense uses the User-Agent header starting with the string "Mozilla" as a
  defense mechanism. This defense is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the User-Agent
  header to be modified. Combined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser, and this
  vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently visits a malicious
  website, or is served a malicious advertisement (malvertising). This issue has been patched
  in version 2.52.0.
