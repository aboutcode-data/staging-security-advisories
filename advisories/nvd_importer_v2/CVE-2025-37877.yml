summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

  If iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing
  down already-configured groups and default domains, however this
  currently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even
  historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across
  architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present
  whose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to
  work anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put
  things back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all, and certainly
  the potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure
  we clean up the dev->dma_iommu flag along with everything else.
