aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  regulator: core: Prevent integer underflow

  By using a ratio of delay to poll_enabled_time that is not integer
  time_remaining underflows and does not exit the loop as expected.
  As delay could be derived from DT and poll_enabled_time is defined
  in the driver this can easily happen.

  Use a signed iterator to make sure that the loop exits once
  the remaining time is negative.
