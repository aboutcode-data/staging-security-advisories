aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process for the GUI of the Cisco Identity Services
  Engine (ISE) 2.1(0.474) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
  of service (DoS) condition on an affected device where the ISE GUI may fail to respond to
  new or established connection requests. The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP rate
  limiting protection on the GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the
  affected device a high rate of TCP connections to the GUI. An exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the GUI to stop responding while the high rate of connections is in progress. Cisco
