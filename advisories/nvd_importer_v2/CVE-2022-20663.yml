summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;Secure Network\
  \ Analytics, formerly Stealthwatch Enterprise, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\nThe vulnerability\
  \ is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface\
  \ of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user\
  \ to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based\
  \ information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There\
  \ are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.Attention: Simplifying the Cisco&nbsp;portfolio\
  \ includes the renaming of security products under one brand: Cisco&nbsp;Secure. For more\
  \ information, see ."
