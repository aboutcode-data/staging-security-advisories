aliases: []
summary: In Ruckus Network Director (RND) < 4.5.0.54, the OVA appliance contains hardcoded credentials
  for the ruckus PostgreSQL database user. In the default configuration, the PostgreSQL service
  is accessible over the network on TCP port 5432. An attacker can use the hardcoded credentials
  to authenticate remotely, gaining superuser access to the database. This allows creation of
  administrative users for the web interface, extraction of password hashes, and execution of
  arbitrary OS commands.
