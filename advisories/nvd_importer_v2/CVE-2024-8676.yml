aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in CRI-O, where it can be requested to take a checkpoint
  archive of a container and later be asked to restore it. When it does that restoration, it
  attempts to restore the mounts from the restore archive instead of the pod request. As a result,
  the validations run on the pod spec, verifying that the pod has access to the mounts it specifies
  are not applicable to a restored container. This flaw allows a malicious user to trick CRI-O
  into restoring a pod that doesn't have access to host mounts. The user needs access to the
  kubelet or cri-o socket to call the restore endpoint and trigger the restore.
