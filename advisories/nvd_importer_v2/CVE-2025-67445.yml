aliases: []
summary: TOTOLINK X5000R V9.1.0cu.2415_B20250515 contains a denial-of-service vulnerability
  in /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The CGI reads the CONTENT_LENGTH environment variable and allocates
  memory using malloc (CONTENT_LENGTH + 1) without sufficient bounds checking. When lighttpd
  s request size limit is not enforced, a crafted large POST request can cause memory exhaustion
  or a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the management CGI and loss of availability
  of the web interface.
