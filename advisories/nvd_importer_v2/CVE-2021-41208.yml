aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the
  code for boosted trees in TensorFlow is still missing validation. As a result, attackers can
  trigger denial of service (via dereferencing `nullptr`s or via `CHECK`-failures) as well as
  abuse undefined behavior (binding references to `nullptr`s). An attacker can also read and
  write from heap buffers, depending on the API that gets used and the arguments that are passed
  to the call. Given that the boosted trees implementation in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it
  is recommend to no longer use these APIs. We will deprecate TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs
  in subsequent releases. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range.
