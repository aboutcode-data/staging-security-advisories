aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bnxt_en: Shutdown FW DMA in bnxt_shutdown()

  The netif_close() call in bnxt_shutdown() only stops packet DMA.  There
  may be FW DMA for trace logging (recently added) that will continue.  If
  we kexec to a new kernel, the DMA will corrupt memory in the new kernel.

  Add bnxt_hwrm_func_drv_unrgtr() to unregister the driver from the FW.
  This will stop the FW DMA.  In case the call fails, call pcie_flr() to
  reset the function and stop the DMA.
