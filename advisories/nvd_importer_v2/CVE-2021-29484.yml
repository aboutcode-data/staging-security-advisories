aliases: []
summary: Ghost is a Node.js CMS. An unused endpoint added during the development of 4.0.0 has
  left sites vulnerable to untrusted users gaining access to Ghost Admin. Attackers can gain
  access by getting logged in users to click a link containing malicious code. Users do not
  need to enter credentials and may not know they've visited a malicious site. Ghost(Pro) has
  already been patched. We can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior
  to the patch being added. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version between 4.0.0
  and 4.3.2. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site. The issue has been fixed
  in 4.3.3, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible. As the endpoint is unused, the
  patch simply removes it. As a workaround blocking access to /ghost/preview can also mitigate
  the issue.
