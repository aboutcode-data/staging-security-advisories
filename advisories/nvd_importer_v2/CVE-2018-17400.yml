summary: 'The PhonePe wallet (aka com.PhonePe.app) application 3.0.6 through 3.3.26 for Android
  might allow attackers to perform Account Takeover attacks by intercepting the user name and
  PIN during the initial configuration of the application.  NOTE: the vendor says that, to exploit
  this, the user has to explicitly install a malicious app and provide accessibility permission
  to the malicious app, that the Android platform provides fair warnings to the users before
  turning on accessibility for any application, and that it believes it is similar to installing
  malicious keyboards, or malicious apps taking screenshots'
