aliases: []
summary: biscuit-rust is the Rust implementation of Biscuit, an authentication and authorization
  token for microservices architectures. Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring
  the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a ThirdPartyBlock request can be sent,
  providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it, which includes
  the public key of the previous block (used in the signature) and the public keys part of the
  token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request
  forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting
  the wrong keypair.
