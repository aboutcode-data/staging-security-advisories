aliases: []
summary: The Crypto Payment Gateway with Payeer for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to payment bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the plugin not
  properly verifying a payments status through server-side validation though the /wc-api/bp-payeer-gateway-callback
  endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update unpaid order statuses
  to paid resulting in a loss of revenue.
