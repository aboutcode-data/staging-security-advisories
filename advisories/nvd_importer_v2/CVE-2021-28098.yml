aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Forescout CounterACT before 8.1.4. A local privilege escalation
  vulnerability is present in the logging function. SecureConnector runs with administrative
  privileges and writes logs entries to a file in %PROGRAMDATA%\ForeScout SecureConnector\ that
  has full permissions for the Everyone group. Using a symbolic link allows an attacker to point
  the log file to a privileged location such as %WINDIR%\System32. The resulting log file adopts
  the file permissions of the source of the symbolic link (in this case, the Everyone group).
  The log file in System32 can be replaced and renamed with a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.
