aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in libsoup, an HTTP client/server library. This HTTP Request Smuggling
  vulnerability arises from non-RFC-compliant parsing in the soup_filter_input_stream_read_line()
  logic, where libsoup accepts malformed chunk headers, such as lone line feed (LF) characters
  instead of the required carriage return and line feed (CRLF). A remote attacker can exploit
  this without authentication or user interaction by sending specially crafted chunked requests.
  This allows libsoup to parse and process multiple HTTP requests from a single network message,
  potentially leading to information disclosure.
