aliases: []
summary: FACTION is a PenTesting Report Generation and Collaboration Framework. Prior to version
  1.7.1, an extension execution path in Faction’s extension framework permits untrusted extension
  code to execute arbitrary system commands on the server when a lifecycle hook is invoked,
  resulting in remote code execution (RCE) on the host running Faction. Due to a missing authentication
  check on the /portal/AppStoreDashboard endpoint, an attacker can access the extension management
  UI and upload a malicious extension without any authentication, making this vulnerability
  exploitable by unauthenticated users. This issue has been patched in version 1.7.1.
