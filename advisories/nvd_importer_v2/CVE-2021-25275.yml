aliases: []
summary: SolarWinds Orion Platform before 2020.2.4, as used by various SolarWinds products,
  installs and uses a SQL Server backend, and stores database credentials to access this backend
  in a file readable by unprivileged users. As a result, any user having access to the filesystem
  can read database login details from that file, including the login name and its associated
  password. Then, the credentials can be used to get database owner access to the SWNetPerfMon.DB
  database. This gives access to the data collected by SolarWinds applications, and leads to
  admin access to the applications by inserting or changing authentication data stored in the
  Accounts table of the database.
