aliases: []
summary: It was found in OpenShift, before version 4.8, that the generated certificate for the
  in-cluster Service CA, incorrectly included additional certificates. The Service CA is automatically
  mounted into all pods, allowing them to safely connect to trusted in-cluster services that
  present certificates signed by the trusted Service CA. The incorrect inclusion of additional
  CAs in this certificate would allow an attacker that compromises any of the additional CAs
  to masquerade as a trusted in-cluster service.
