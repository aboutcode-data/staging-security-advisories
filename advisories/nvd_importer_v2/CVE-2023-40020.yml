summary: PrivateUploader is an open source image hosting server written in Vue and TypeScript.
  In affected versions `app/routes/v3/admin.controller.ts` did not correctly verify whether
  the user was an administrator (High Level) or moderator (Low Level) causing the request to
  continue processing. The response would be a 403 with ADMIN_ONLY, however, next() would call
  leading to any updates/changes in the route to process. This issue has been addressed in version
  3.2.49. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
