aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the inter-device communication mechanisms between devices that\
  \ are running Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software and devices that are running Cisco\
  \ Firepower Management (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute\
  \ arbitrary commands with root permissions on the underlying operating system of an affected\
  \ device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the expert mode of an affected\
  \ device and submitting specific commands to a connected system. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an FMC device if the attacker\
  \ has administrative privileges on an associated FTD device. Alternatively, a successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an FTD device if the\
  \ attacker has administrative privileges on an associated FMC device."
