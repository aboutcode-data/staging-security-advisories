aliases: []
summary: Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and automated testing.
  Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions
  of Kiwi TCMS had introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous files
  from being uploaded and Content-Security-Policy definition to prevent cross-site-scripting
  attacks. The upload validation checks were not 100% robust which left the possibility to circumvent
  them and upload a potentially dangerous file which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript
  in the browser. Additionally we've discovered that Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive will strip
  some headers negating protections built into Kiwi TCMS when served behind a reverse proxy.
  This issue has been addressed in version 12.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade who are serving Kiwi TCMS behind a reverse proxy should make sure that additional
  header values are still passed to the client browser. If they aren't redefining them inside
  the proxy configuration.
