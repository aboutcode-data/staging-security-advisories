aliases: []
summary: The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up
  to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency). This is
  due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a
  value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  execute arbitrary shortcodes.
