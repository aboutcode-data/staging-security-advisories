  bpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace

  There is a potential infinite loop issue that can occur when using a
  combination of tail calls and freplace.

  In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of
  tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in
  entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:

  entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.

  The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to
  zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism
  to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.

  To fix this issue, the solution is twofold:

  1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a
     prog_array map.
  2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map
     with an freplace program.

  This ensures that:

  * If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,
    it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.
  * If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its
    subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.

  Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return
  -EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a
  prog_array map.

  Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a
  tab for proper formatting.
