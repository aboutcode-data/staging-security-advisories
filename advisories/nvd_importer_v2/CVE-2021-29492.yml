aliases: []
summary: 'Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy does not decode escaped slash
  sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in HTTP URL paths in versions 1.18.2 and before. A remote attacker
  may craft a path with escaped slashes, e.g. `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`, to bypass access control,
  e.g. a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then decode slash sequences and normalize
  path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.
  ### Impact Escalation of Privileges when using RBAC or JWT filters with enforcement based
  on URL path. Users with back end servers that interpret `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably
  are impacted. ### Attack Vector URL paths containing escaped slash characters delivered by
  untrusted client. Patches in versions 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5 contain new path normalization
  option to decode escaped slash characters. As a workaround, if back end servers treat `%2F`
  and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably and a URL path based access control is configured,
  one may reconfigure the back end server to not treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably.'
