  bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storage

  Lonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storage
  can be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing a
  cgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program
  doing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of
  the indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context
  the bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the
  BPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program
  uses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the
  runtime context:

    ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);
    storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];

    if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)
      ptr = &READ_ONCE(storage->buf)->data[0];
    else
      ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);

  For the second program which was called from the originally attached
  one, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former
  program's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can result
  in an unintended out-of-bounds access.

  To fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of
  storage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original
  program if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or
  ii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not
  using any of the cgroup local storage maps.
