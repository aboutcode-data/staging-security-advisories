aliases: []
summary: 'Directory traversal vulnerability in SAP Business Connector (BC) 4.6 and 4.7 allows
  remote attackers to read or delete arbitrary files via the fullName parameter to (1) sapbc/SAP/chopSAPLog.dsp
  or (2) invoke/sap.monitor.rfcTrace/deleteSingle.  Details will be updated after the grace
  period has ended.  NOTE: SAP Business Connector is an OEM version of webMethods Integration
  Server.  webMethods states that this issue can only occur when the product is installed as
  root/admin, and if the attacker has access to a general purpose port; however, both are discouraged
  in the documentation.  In addition, the attacker must already have acquired administrative
  privileges through other means.'
