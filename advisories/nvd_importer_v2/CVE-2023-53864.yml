  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/mxsfb: Disable overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_disable()

  When disabling overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_update(),
  overlay plane's framebuffer pointer is NULL.  So, dereferencing it would
  cause a kernel Oops(NULL pointer dereferencing).  Fix the issue by
  disabling overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_disable() instead.
