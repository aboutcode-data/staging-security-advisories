aliases: []
summary: The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that is intended to be used to validate the
  path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such as pg_dump and pg_restore. The utility
  is executed by the server to determine what PostgreSQL version it is from. Versions of pgAdmin
  prior to 6.17 failed to properly secure this API, which could allow an unauthenticated user
  to call it with a path of their choosing, such as a UNC path to a server they control on a
  Windows machine. This would cause an appropriately named executable in the target path to
  be executed by the pgAdmin server.
