aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: starfive - Correctly handle return of sg_nents_for_len

  The return value of sg_nents_for_len was assigned to an unsigned long
  in starfive_hash_digest, causing negative error codes to be converted
  to large positive integers.

  Add error checking for sg_nents_for_len and return immediately on
  failure to prevent potential buffer overflows.
