aliases: []
summary: Lif Auth Server is a server for validating logins, managing information, and account
  recovery for Lif Accounts. The issue relates to the `get_pfp` and `get_banner` routes on Auth
  Server. The issue is that there is no check to ensure that the file that Auth Server is receiving
  through these URLs is correct. This could allow an attacker access to files they shouldn't
  have access to. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0.
