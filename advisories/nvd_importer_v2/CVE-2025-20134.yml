summary: "A vulnerability in the certificate processing of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security\
  \ Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting\
  \ in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper parsing\
  \ of SSL/TLS certificates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted\
  \ DNS packets that match a static Network Address Translation (NAT) rule with DNS inspection\
  \ enabled through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause\
  \ the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
