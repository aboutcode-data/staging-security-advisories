aliases: []
summary: Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.7.0 a malicious
  actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server
  to exit, resulting in denial of service. This is possible only while a live query is currently
  ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given the requirement that
  the actor has a valid node key. There is no information disclosure, privilege escalation,
  or code execution. The issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0.
