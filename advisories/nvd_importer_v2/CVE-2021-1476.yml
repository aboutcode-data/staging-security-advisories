summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and
  Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of commands that are supplied by
  the user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting
  crafted input for specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  commands on the underlying OS with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
  must have valid administrator-level credentials.
