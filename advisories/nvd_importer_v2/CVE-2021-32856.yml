summary: Microweber is a drag and drop website builder and content management system. Versions
  1.2.12 and prior are vulnerable to copy-paste cross-site scripting (XSS). For this particular
  type of XSS, the victim needs to be fooled into copying a malicious payload into the text
  editor. A fix was attempted in versions 1.2.9 and 1.2.12, but it is incomplete.
