aliases: []
summary: Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language
  development. In some cases, Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that
  would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This occurs when dependency
  verification is disabled on one or more configurations and those configurations have common
  dependencies with other configurations that have dependency verification enabled. If the configuration
  that has dependency verification disabled is resolved first, Gradle does not verify the common
  dependencies for the configuration that has dependency verification enabled. Gradle 7.4 fixes
  that issue by validating artifacts at least once if they are present in a resolved configuration
  that has dependency verification active. For users who cannot update either do not use `ResolutionStrategy.disableDependencyVerification()`
  and do not use plugins that use that method to disable dependency verification for a single
  configuration or make sure resolution of configuration that disable that feature do not happen
  in builds that resolve configuration where the feature is enabled.
