summary: A vulnerability in the SageMaker Workflow component of aws/sagemaker-python-sdk allows
  for the possibility of MD5 hash collisions in all versions. This can lead to workflows being
  inadvertently replaced due to the reuse of results from different configurations that produce
  the same MD5 hash. This issue can cause integrity problems within the pipeline, potentially
  leading to erroneous processing outcomes.
