aliases: []
summary: 'Javamail does not properly handle a series of invalid login attempts in which the
  same e-mail address is entered as username and password, and the domain portion of this address
  yields a Java UnknownHostException error, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (connection pool exhaustion) via a large number of requests, resulting in a SQLNestedException.  NOTE:
  Sun disputes this issue, stating "The report makes references to source code and files that
  do not exist in the mentioned products.'
