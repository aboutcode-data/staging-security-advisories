aliases: []
summary: The Tabs for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 via deserialization of untrusted input in the
  'product_has_custom_tabs' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Shop Manager-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
  in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin
  or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an
  additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform
  actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on
  the POP chain present.
