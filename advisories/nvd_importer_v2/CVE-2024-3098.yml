summary: A vulnerability was identified in the `exec_utils` class of the `llama_index` package,
  specifically within the `safe_eval` function, allowing for prompt injection leading to arbitrary
  code execution. This issue arises due to insufficient validation of input, which can be exploited
  to bypass method restrictions and execute unauthorized code. The vulnerability is a bypass
  of the previously addressed CVE-2023-39662, demonstrated through a proof of concept that creates
  a file on the system by exploiting the flaw.
