summary: The Traveler theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.1.8 via the 'hotel_alone_load_more_post' function 'style' parameter.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files

  bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php
  file type can be uploaded and included.
