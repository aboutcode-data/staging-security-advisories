aliases: []
summary: RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, contains a network
  stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. An attacker can send a crafted frame to
  the device resulting in a large out of bounds write beyond the packet buffer. The write will
  create a hard fault exception after reaching the last page of RAM. The hard fault is not handled
  and the system will be stuck until reset. Thus the impact is denial of service. Version 2022.10
  fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patch manually.
