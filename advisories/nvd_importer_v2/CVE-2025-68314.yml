summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/msm: make sure last_fence is always updated

  Update last_fence in the vm-bind path instead of kernel managed path.

  last_fence is used to wait for work to finish in vm_bind contexts but not
  used for kernel managed contexts.

  This fixes a bug where last_fence is not waited on context close leading
  to faults as resources are freed while in use.
