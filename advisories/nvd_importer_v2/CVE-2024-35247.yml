  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount

  The current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level
  module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer
  to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can
  lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region
  during programming if the parent device does not have a driver.

  To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region
  struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for
  registering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and
  rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper
  macros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the
  owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules
  and reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.

  Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface
  for registering an fpga region.
