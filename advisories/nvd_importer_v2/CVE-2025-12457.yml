summary: The Enable SVG, WebP, and ICO Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
