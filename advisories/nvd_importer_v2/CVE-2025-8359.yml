summary: The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 6.0.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity
  prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log
  in as other users, including administrators, without access to a password.
