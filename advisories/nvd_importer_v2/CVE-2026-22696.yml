aliases: []
summary: dcap-qvl implements the quote verification logic for DCAP (Data Center Attestation
  Primitives). A vulnerability present in versions prior to 0.3.9 involves a critical gap in
  the cryptographic verification process within the dcap-qvl. The library fetches QE Identity
  collateral (including qe_identity, qe_identity_signature, and qe_identity_issuer_chain) from
  the PCCS. However, it skips to verify the QE Identity signature against its certificate chain
  and does not enforce policy constraints on the QE Report. An attacker can forge the QE Identity
  data to whitelist a malicious or non-Intel Quoting Enclave. This allows the attacker to forge
  the QE and sign untrusted quotes that the verifier will accept as valid. Effectively, this
  bypasses the entire remote attestation security model, as the verifier can no longer trust
  the entity responsible for signing the quotes. All deployments utilizing the dcap-qvl library
  for SGX or TDX quote verification are affected. The vulnerability has been patched in dcap-qvl
  version 0.3.9. The fix implements the missing cryptographic verification for the QE Identity
  signature and enforces the required checks for MRSIGNER, ISVPRODID, and ISVSVN against the
  QE Report. Users of the `@phala/dcap-qvl-node` and `@phala/dcap-qvl-web` packages should switch
  to the pure JavaScript implementation, `@phala/dcap-qvl`. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability. Users must upgrade to the patched version to ensure that QE Identity collateral
  is properly verified.
