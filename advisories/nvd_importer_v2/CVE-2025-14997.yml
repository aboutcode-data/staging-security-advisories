aliases: []
summary: The BuddyPress Xprofile Custom Field Types plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'delete_field' function in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can
  easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
