summary: "A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) polling for Cisco Secure\
  \ Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could\
  \ allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain confidential information about the underlying\
  \ operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the appliances do not protect\
  \ confidential information at rest in response to SNMP poll requests. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP poll request to the affected appliance. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information that should be restricted.\
  \ To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the configured SNMP credentials."
