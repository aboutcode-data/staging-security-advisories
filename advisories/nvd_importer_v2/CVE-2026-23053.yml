  NFS: Fix a deadlock involving nfs_release_folio()

  Wang Zhaolong reports a deadlock involving NFSv4.1 state recovery
  waiting on kthreadd, which is attempting to reclaim memory by calling
  nfs_release_folio(). The latter cannot make progress due to state
  recovery being needed.

  It seems that the only safe thing to do here is to kick off a writeback
  of the folio, without waiting for completion, or else kicking off an
  asynchronous commit.
