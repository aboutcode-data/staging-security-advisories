aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the SIP processing subsystem of Cisco BroadWorks could allow an\
  \ unauthenticated, remote attacker to halt the processing of incoming SIP requests, resulting\
  \ in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper memory\
  \ handling for certain SIP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ a high number of SIP requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to exhaust the memory that was allocated to the Cisco BroadWorks Network Servers\
  \ that handle SIP traffic. If no memory is available, the Network Servers can no longer process\
  \ incoming requests, resulting in a DoS condition that requires manual intervention to recover."
