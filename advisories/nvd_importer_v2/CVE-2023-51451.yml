aliases: []
summary: Symbolicator is a service used in Sentry. Starting in Symbolicator version 0.3.3 and
  prior to version 21.12.1, an attacker could make Symbolicator send GET HTTP requests to arbitrary
  URLs with internal IP addresses by using an invalid protocol. The responses of those requests
  could be exposed via Symbolicator's API. In affected Sentry instances, the data could be exposed
  through the Sentry API and user interface if the attacker has a registered account. The issue
  has been fixed in Symbolicator release 23.12.1, Sentry self-hosted release 23.12.1, and has
  already been mitigated on sentry.io on December 18, 2023. If updating is not possible, some
  other mitigations are available. One may disable JS processing by toggling the option `Allow
  JavaScript Source Fetching` in `Organization Settings > Security & Privacy` and/or disable
  all untrusted public repositories under `Project Settings > Debug Files`. Alternatively, if
  JavaScript and native symbolication are not required, disable Symbolicator completely in `config.yml`.
