aliases: []
summary: 'n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. From version 1.0.0 to before 2.0.0,
  a sandbox bypass vulnerability exists in the Python Code Node that uses Pyodide. An authenticated
  user with permission to create or modify workflows can exploit this vulnerability to execute
  arbitrary commands on the host system running n8n, using the same privileges as the n8n process.
  This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0. Workarounds for this issue involve disabling
  the Code Node by setting the environment variable NODES_EXCLUDE: "[\"n8n-nodes-base.code\"]",
  disabling Python support in the Code node by setting the environment variable N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=false,
  which was introduced in n8n version 1.104.0, and configuring n8n to use the task runner based
  Python sandbox via the N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED and N8N_NATIVE_PYTHON_RUNNER environment variables.'
