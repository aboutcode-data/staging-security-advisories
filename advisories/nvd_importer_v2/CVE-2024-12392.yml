summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in binary-husky/gpt_academic
  version git 310122f. The application has a functionality to download papers from arxiv.org,
  but the URL validation is incomplete. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make the

  used to access data that are only accessible from the server, such as AWS metadata credentials,
  and can escalate local exploits to network-based attacks.
