aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in ClusterLabs Hawk (aka HA Web Konsole) through 2.3.0-15.
  It ships the binary hawk_invoke (built from tools/hawk_invoke.c), intended to be used as a
  setuid program. This allows the hacluster user to invoke certain commands as root (with an
  attempt to limit this to safe combinations). This user is able to execute an interactive "shell"
  that isn't limited to the commands specified in hawk_invoke, allowing escalation to root.
