summary: The WP Private Content Plus through 3.6.2 provides a global content protection feature
  that requires a password. However, the access control check is based only on the presence
  of an unprotected client-side cookie. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can completely
  bypass the password protection by manually setting the cookie value in their browser.
