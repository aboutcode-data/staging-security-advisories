summary: The ContentMX Content Publisher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the cmx_activate_connection function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to bind their own ContentMX connection via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
