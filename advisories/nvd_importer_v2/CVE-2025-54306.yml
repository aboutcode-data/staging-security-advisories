aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the Thermo Fisher Torrent Suite Django application 5.18.1.
  A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the network configuration functionality, stemming
  from insufficient input validation when processing network configuration parameters through
  administrative endpoints. The application allows administrators to modify the server's network
  configuration through the Django application. This configuration is processed by Bash scripts
  (TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy) that write user-controlled data directly to environment variables
  without proper sanitization. After updating environment variables, the scripts execute a source
  command on /etc/environment; if an attacker injects malicious data into environment variables,
  this command can enable arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability begins with the /admin/network
  endpoint, which passes user-supplied form data as arguments to subprocess.Popen calls. The
  user-supplied input is then used to update environment variables in TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy,
  and finally source $environment is executed.
