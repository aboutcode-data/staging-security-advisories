summary: The Oliver POS – A WooCommerce Point of Sale (POS) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on several functions hooked via AJAX
  in the includes/class-pos-bridge-install.php file in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.8.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
  to perform several unauthorized actions like deactivating the plugin, disconnecting the subscription,
  syncing the status and more.
