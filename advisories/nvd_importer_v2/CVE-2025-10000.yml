summary: The Qyrr – simply and modern QR-Code creation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the blob_to_file() function

  with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
