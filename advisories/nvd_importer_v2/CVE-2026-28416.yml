aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. Prior to version
  6.6.0, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Gradio allows an attacker to
  make arbitrary HTTP requests from a victim's server by hosting a malicious Gradio Space. When
  a victim application uses `gr.load()` to load an attacker-controlled Space, the malicious
  `proxy_url` from the config is trusted and added to the allowlist, enabling the attacker to
  access internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, and private networks through the victim's
  infrastructure. Version 6.6.0 fixes the issue.
