aliases: []
summary: The Form Maker by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.35. This is due to the plugin's default file upload
  allowlist including SVG files combined with weak substring-based extension validation. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious SVG files containing JavaScript
  code that will execute when viewed by administrators or site visitors via file upload fields
  in forms granted they can submit forms.
