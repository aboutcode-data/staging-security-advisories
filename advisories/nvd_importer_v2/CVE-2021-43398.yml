aliases: []
summary: 'Crypto++ (aka Cryptopp) 8.6.0 and earlier contains a timing leakage in MakePublicKey().
  There is a clear correlation between execution time and private key length, which may cause
  disclosure of the length information of the private key. This might allow attackers to conduct
  timing attacks. NOTE: this report is disputed by the vendor and multiple third parties. The
  execution-time differences are intentional. A user may make a choice of a longer key as a
  tradeoff between strength and performance. In making this choice, the amount of information
  leaked to an adversary is of infinitesimal value'
