aliases: []
summary: Wasmtime is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's filesystem sandbox
  implementation on Windows blocks access to special device filenames such as "COM1", "COM2",
  "LPT0", "LPT1", and so on, however it did not block access to the special device filenames
  which use superscript digits, such as "COM¹", "COM²", "LPT⁰", "LPT¹", and so on. Untrusted
  Wasm programs that are given access to any filesystem directory could bypass the sandbox and
  access devices through those special device filenames with superscript digits, and through
  them gain access peripheral devices connected to the computer, or network resources mapped
  to those devices. This can include modems, printers, network printers, and any other device
  connected to a serial or parallel port, including emulated USB serial ports. Patch releases
  for Wasmtime have been issued as 24.0.2, 25.0.3, and 26.0.1. Users of Wasmtime 23.0.x and
  prior are recommended to upgrade to one of these patched versions. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue. Affected Windows users are recommended to upgrade.
