aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager and Web Security Agent components of
  Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to perform a DLL injection attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need
  to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by inserting a configuration file in a specific path in the system
  which, in turn, causes a malicious DLL file to be loaded when the application starts. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM
  privileges.
