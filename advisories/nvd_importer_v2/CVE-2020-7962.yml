aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in One Identity Password Manager 5.8. An attacker could enumerate
  valid answers for a user. It is possible for an attacker to detect a valid answer based on
  the HTTP response content, and reuse this answer later for a password reset on a chosen password.
  The enumeration is possible because, within the HTTP response content, WRONG ID is only returned
  when the answer is incorrect.
