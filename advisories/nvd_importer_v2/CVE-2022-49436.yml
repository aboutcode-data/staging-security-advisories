  powerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking nvdimm_events_map elements

  Right now 'char *' elements allocated for individual 'stat_id' in
  'papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map[]' during papr_scm_pmu_check_events(), get
  leaked in papr_scm_remove() and papr_scm_pmu_register(),
  papr_scm_pmu_check_events() error paths.

  Also individual 'stat_id' arent NULL terminated 'char *' instead they are fixed
  8-byte sized identifiers. However papr_scm_pmu_register() assumes it to be a
  NULL terminated 'char *' and at other places it assumes it to be a
  'papr_scm_perf_stat.stat_id' sized string which is 8-byes in size.

  Fix this by allocating the memory for papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map to also
  include space for 'stat_id' entries. This is possible since number of available
  events/stat_ids are known upfront. This saves some memory and one extra level of
  indirection from 'nvdimm_events_map' to 'stat_id'. Also rest of the code
  can continue to call 'kfree(papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map)' without needing to
  iterate over the array and free up individual elements.
