  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/damon/sysfs: cleanup attrs subdirs on context dir setup failure

  When a context DAMON sysfs directory setup is failed after setup of attrs/
  directory, subdirectories of attrs/ directory are not cleaned up.  As a
  result, DAMON sysfs interface is nearly broken until the system reboots,
  and the memory for the unremoved directory is leaked.

  Cleanup the directories under such failures.
