aliases: []
summary: Alloy Core libraries at the root of the Rust Ethereum ecosystem. Prior to 0.8.26 and
  1.4.1, an uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData could lead
  to a denial-of-service (DoS) via eip712_signing_hash(). Software with high availability requirements
  such as network services may be particularly impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting
  mechanisms can partially mitigate the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible.
  The vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before
  accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version
  v1.4.1 and backported to v0.8.26.
