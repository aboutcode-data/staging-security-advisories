aliases: []
summary: A script injection vulnerability was identified in the Tuned package. The `instance_create()`
  D-Bus function can be called by locally logged-in users without authentication. This flaw
  allows a local non-privileged user to execute a D-Bus call with `script_pre` or `script_post`
  options that permit arbitrary scripts with their absolute paths to be passed. These user or
  attacker-controlled executable scripts or programs could then be executed by Tuned with root
  privileges that could allow attackers to local privilege escalation.
