aliases: []
summary: Attackers with access to the "documentconverterws" API were able to inject serialized
  Java objects, that were not properly checked during deserialization. Access to this API endpoint
  is restricted to local networks by default. Arbitrary code could be injected that is being
  executed when processing the request. A check has been introduced to restrict processing of
  legal and expected classes for this API. We now log a warning in case there are attempts to
  inject illegal classes. No publicly available exploits are known.
