aliases: []
summary: Multiple interpretation error in Ukrainian National Antivirus (UNA) 1.83.2.16 with
  kernel 265 allows remote attackers to bypass virus scanning via a file such as BAT, HTML,
  and EML with an "MZ" magic byte sequence which is normally associated with EXE, which causes
  the file to be treated as a safe type that could still be executed as a dangerous file type
  by applications on the end system, as demonstrated by a "triple headed" program that contains
  EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka the "magic byte bug."
