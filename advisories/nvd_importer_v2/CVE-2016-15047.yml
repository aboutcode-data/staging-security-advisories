aliases: []
summary: AVTECH devices that include the CloudSetup.cgi management endpoint are vulnerable to
  authenticated OS command injection. The `exefile` parameter in CloudSetup.cgi is passed to
  the underlying system command execution without proper validation or whitelisting. An authenticated
  attacker who can invoke this endpoint can supply crafted input to execute arbitrary system
  commands as root. Successful exploitation grants full control of the device, and - depending
  on deployment and whether the device stores credentials or has network reachability to internal
  systems - may enable credential theft, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. The archived
  SEARCH-LAB disclosure implies that this vulnerability was remediated in early 2017, but AVTECH
  has not defined an affected version range.
