aliases: []
summary: Multiple XSS issues were discovered in Sage XRT Business Exchange 12.4.302 that allow
  an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. The attacker
  needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Filters
  and Display model features (OnlineBanking > Web Monitoring > Settings > Filters / Display
  models). The name of a filter or a display model is interpreted as HTML and can thus embed
  JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a stored XSS. Another issue is
  present in the Notification feature (OnlineBanking > Configuration > Notifications and alerts
  > Alerts *). The name of an alert is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code,
  which is executed when displayed. This is a stored XSS. (Also, an issue is present in the
  File download feature, accessible via /OnlineBanking/cgi/isapi.dll/DOWNLOADFRS. When requesting
  to show the list of downloadable files, the contents of three form fields are embedded in
  the JavaScript code without prior sanitization. This is essentially a self-XSS.)
