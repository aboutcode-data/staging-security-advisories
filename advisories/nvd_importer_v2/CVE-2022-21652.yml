aliases: []
summary: Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. In affected versions shopware
  would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7
  the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password
  change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that
  upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically
  considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.
