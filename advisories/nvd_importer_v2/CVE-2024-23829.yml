aliases: []
summary: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Security-sensitive
  parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that
  must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect
  against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions
  that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.  Being more lenient
  than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request
  smuggling. The unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application
  server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for
  CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2 fixes this vulnerability.
