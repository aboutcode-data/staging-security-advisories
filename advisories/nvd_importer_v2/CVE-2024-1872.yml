aliases: []
summary: The Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.1.28 via deserialization of untrusted input in the button_shortcode
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin.
  If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,
  it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code.
