summary: The Remote Content Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'remote_content' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 due

  it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
