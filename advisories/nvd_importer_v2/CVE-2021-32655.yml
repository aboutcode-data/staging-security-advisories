aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. In versions prior
  to 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2, an attacker is able to convert a Files Drop link to a federated
  share. This causes an issue on the UI side of the sharing user. When the sharing user opens
  the sharing panel and tries to remove the "Create" privileges of this unexpected share, Nextcloud
  server would silently grant the share read privileges. The vulnerability is patched in versions
  19.0.11, 20.0.10 and 21.0.2. No workarounds are known to exist.
