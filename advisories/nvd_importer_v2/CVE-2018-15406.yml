summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Director could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface
  of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of
  the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access
  sensitive, browser-based information.
