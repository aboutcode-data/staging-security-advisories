summary: In Splunk Add-on for Palo Alto Networks versions below 2.0.2, the add-on exposes client
  secrets in plain text in the _internal index during the addition of new “Data Security Accounts“.
  The vulnerability would require either local access to the log files or administrative access
  to internal indexes, which by default only the admin role receives. Review roles and capabilities
  on your instance and restrict internal index access to administrator-level roles. See [Define
  roles on the Splunk platform with capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities)
  in the Splunk documentation for more information.
