summary: 'There exists a use after free vulnerability in Reverb. Reverb supports the VARIANT
  datatype, which is supposed to represent an arbitrary object in C++. When a tensor proto of
  type VARIANT is unpacked, memory is first allocated to store the entire tensor, and a ctor
  is called on each instance. Afterwards, Reverb copies the content in tensor_content to the
  previously mentioned pre-allocated memory, which results in the bytes in tensor_content overwriting
  the vtable pointers of all the objects which were previously allocated. Reverb exposes 2 relevant
  gRPC endpoints: InsertStream and SampleStream. The attacker can insert this stream into the
  server’s database, then when the client next calls SampleStream they will unpack the tensor
  into RAM, and when any method on that object is called (including its destructor) the attacker
  gains control of the Program Counter. We recommend upgrading past git commit  https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb/commit/6a0dcf4c9e842b7f999912f792aaa6f6bd261a25'
