  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  regulator: raa215300: Fix resource leak in case of error

  The clk_register_clkdev() allocates memory by calling vclkdev_alloc() and
  this memory is not freed in the error path. Similarly, resources allocated
  by clk_register_fixed_rate() are not freed in the error path.

  Fix these issues by using devm_clk_hw_register_fixed_rate() and
  devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev().

  After this, the static variable clk is not needed. Replace it with 
  local variable hw in probe() and drop calling clk_unregister_fixed_rate()
  from raa215300_rtc_unregister_device().
