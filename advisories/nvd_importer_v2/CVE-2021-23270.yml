aliases: []
summary: In Gargoyle OS 1.12.0, when IPv6 is used, a routing loop can occur that generates excessive
  network traffic between an affected device and its upstream ISP's router. This occurs when
  a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to
  the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at
  least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set.
