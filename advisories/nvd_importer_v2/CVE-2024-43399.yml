aliases: []
summary: Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment
  framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. Before 4.0.7, there is a flaw
  in the Static Libraries analysis section. Specifically, during the extraction of .a extension
  files, the measure intended to prevent Zip Slip attacks is improperly implemented. Since the
  implemented measure can be bypassed, the vulnerability allows an attacker to extract files
  to any desired location within the server running MobSF. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.7.
