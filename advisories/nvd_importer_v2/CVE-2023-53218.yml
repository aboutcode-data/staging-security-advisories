summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted

  When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection
  and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling
  data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the
  connection parameters.

  However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned
  and further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is
  made.

  Fix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on
  EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start
  the call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an
  oops may follow shortly thereafter.
