aliases: []
summary: Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel. In Livewire v3 up to and including
  v3.6.3, a vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote command execution
  in specific scenarios. The issue stems from how certain component property updates are hydrated.
  This vulnerability is unique to Livewire v3 and does not affect prior major versions. Exploitation
  requires a component to be mounted and configured in a particular way, but does not require
  authentication or user interaction. This issue has been patched in Livewire v3.6.4. All users
  are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version or later as soon as possible. No known
  workarounds are available.
