aliases: []
summary: Novu provides an API for sending notifications through multiple channels. Versions
  prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the "Sign In with GitHub" functionality
  of Novu's open-source repository. It could have allowed an attacker to force a victim into
  opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into the repository under the victim's account
  gaining full control of the account. This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source
  deployments if the user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on their self-hosted instance of
  Novu. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.0 to receive a patch.
