  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iocost: Fix divide-by-zero on donation from low hweight cgroup

  The donation calculation logic assumes that the donor has non-zero
  after-donation hweight, so the lowest active hweight a donating cgroup can
  have is 2 so that it can donate 1 while keeping the other 1 for itself.
  Earlier, we only donated from cgroups with sizable surpluses so this
  condition was always true. However, with the precise donation algorithm
  implemented, f1de2439ec43 ("blk-iocost: revamp donation amount
  determination") made the donation amount calculation exact enabling even low
  hweight cgroups to donate.

  This means that in rare occasions, a cgroup with active hweight of 1 can
  enter donation calculation triggering the following warning and then a
  divide-by-zero oops.

   iocg: invalid donation weights in /a/b: active=1 donating=1 after=0

  Fix it by excluding cgroups w/ active hweight < 2 from donating. Excluding
  these extreme low hweight donations shouldn't affect work conservation in
  any meaningful way.
