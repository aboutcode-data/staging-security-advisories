  6.0.0 - 6.0.8, 5.3.0 - 5.3.17, 5.2.x and prior Purity//FA releases, and Pure Storage FlashBlade
  products running Purity//FB 3.3.0, 3.2.0 - 3.2.4, 3.1.0 - 3.1.12, 3.0.x and prior Purity//FB
  releases are vulnerable to possibly exposed credentials for accessing the product’s management
  interface. The password may be known outside Pure Storage and could be used on an affected
  system, if reachable, to execute arbitrary instructions with root privileges. No other Pure
  Storage products or services are affected. Remediation is available from Pure Storage via
  a self-serve “opt-in” patch, manual patch application or a software upgrade to an unaffected
  version of Purity software.
