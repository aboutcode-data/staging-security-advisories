aliases: []
summary: Garden is an automation platform for Kubernetes development and testing. In versions
  prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not require authentication. In some operating modes
  this allows for an attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The configuration
  is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server that is responsible for serving the
  Garden dashboard. At the moment, this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible
  to anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a public, static IP).
  This may lead to the ability to compromise credentials, secrets or environment variables.
  Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade
  should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all untrusted network machines.
