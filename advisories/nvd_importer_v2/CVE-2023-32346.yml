aliases: []
summary: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a function that
  allows users to claim their devices. This function returns information based on whether the
  serial number of a device has already been claimed, the MAC address of a device has already
  been claimed, or whether the attempt to claim a device was successful. An attacker could exploit
  this to create a list of the serial numbers and MAC addresses of all devices cloud-connected
  to the Remote Management System.
