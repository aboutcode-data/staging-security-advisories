aliases: []
summary: 'The FindAll Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the ''findall_listing_user_registration_additional_params''
  function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to supply the ''administrator'' role during registration and
  gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability can only be exploited if the
  FindAll Membership plugin is also activated, because user registration is in that plugin.'
