aliases: []
summary: keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for existing plain files when writing data to a temporary
  file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. If a local attacker had previously created a
  file with the expected name (e.g., /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats), with read
  access for the attacker and write access for the keepalived process, then this potentially
  leaked sensitive information.
