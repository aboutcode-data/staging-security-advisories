  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction

  There are two problems with the recursive correction:

  1. It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that
  has 253 iterations. For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block
  recursively. There is a limit of 4 nested recursions - that means that
  there may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE team
  actually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this
  image just makes the udev-worker process get stuck in the 'D' state.

  2. It doesn't work. In fec_read_bufs we store data into the variable
  "fio->bufs", but fio bufs is shared between recursive invocations, if
  "verity_hash_for_block" invoked correction recursively, it would
  overwrite partially filled fio->bufs.
