aliases: []
summary: The Restrict File Access plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the 'restrict-file-access' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when
  the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php), via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
