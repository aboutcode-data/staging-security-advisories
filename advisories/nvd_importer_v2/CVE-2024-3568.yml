aliases: []
summary: The huggingface/transformers library is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through
  deserialization of untrusted data within the `load_repo_checkpoint()` function of the `TFPreTrainedModel()`
  class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized
  payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources.
  This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading
  a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers
  to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine.
