aliases: []
summary: Rucio is a software framework that provides functionality to organize, manage, and
  access large volumes of scientific data using customizable policies. The common Rucio helm-charts
  for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui`, and `rucio-webui` define the log format for the apache
  access log of these components. The `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`, which is part of each request header
  sent to Rucio, is part of this log format. Thus, each access log line potentially exposes
  the credentials (Internal Rucio token, or JWT in case of OIDC authentication) of the user.
  Due to the length of the token (Especially for a JWT) the tokens are often truncated, and
  thus not usable as credential; nevertheless, the (partial) credential should not be part of
  the logfile. The impact of this issue is amplified if the access logs are made available to
  a larger group of people than the instance administrators themselves. An updated release has
  been supplied for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui` and `rucio-webui` helm-chart. The change
  was also retrofitted for the currently supported Rucio LTS releases. The patched versions
  are rucio-server 37.0.2, 35.0.1, and 32.0.1; rucio-ui 37.0.4, 35.0.1, and 32.0.2; and rucio-webui
  37.0.2, 35.1.1, and 32.0.1. As a workaround, one may update the `logFormat` variable and remove
  the `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`.
