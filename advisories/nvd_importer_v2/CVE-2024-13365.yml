aliases: []
summary: The Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to the plugin uploading and extracting .zip archives when scanning them for
  malware through the checkUploadedArchive() function  in all versions up to, and including,
  2.149. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the
  affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
