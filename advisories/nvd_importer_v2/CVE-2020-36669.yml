aliases: []
summary: The JetBackup – WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.3.9. This is due to missing
  nonce validation on the backup_guard_get_import_backup() function. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the vulnerable site's server via
  a forged request, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
