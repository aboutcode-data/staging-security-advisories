aliases: []
summary: A critical vulnerability exists in the NLTK downloader component of nltk/nltk, affecting
  all versions. The _unzip_iter function in nltk/downloader.py uses zipfile.extractall() without
  performing path validation or security checks. This allows attackers to craft malicious zip
  packages that, when downloaded and extracted by NLTK, can execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability
  arises because NLTK assumes all downloaded packages are trusted and extracts them without
  validation. If a malicious package contains Python files, such as __init__.py, these files
  are executed automatically upon import, leading to remote code execution. This issue can result
  in full system compromise, including file system access, network access, and potential persistence
  mechanisms.
