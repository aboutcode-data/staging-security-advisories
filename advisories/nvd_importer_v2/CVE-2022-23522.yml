aliases: []
summary: MindsDB is an open source machine learning platform. An unsafe extraction is being
  performed using `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead
  to the writing of the extracted files to an unintended location. This vulnerability is sometimes
  called a **TarSlip** or a **ZipSlip variant**. Unpacking files using the high-level function
  `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a potentially malicious tarball without validating that the
  destination file path remained within the intended destination directory may cause files to
  be overwritten outside the destination directory. An attacker could craft a malicious tarball
  with a filename path, such as `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, and then serve the archive
  remotely using a personal bucket `s3`, thus, retrieve the tarball through **mindsdb** and
  overwrite the system files of the hosting server. This issue has been addressed in version
  22.11.4.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting archives
  from untrusted sources.
