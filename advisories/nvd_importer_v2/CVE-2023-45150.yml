aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud calendar is a calendar app for the Nextcloud server platform. Due to missing
  precondition checks the server was trying to validate strings of any length as email addresses
  even when megabytes of data were provided, eventually making the server busy and unresponsive.
  It is recommended that the Nextcloud Calendar app is upgraded to 4.4.4. The only workaround
  for users unable to upgrade is to disable the calendar app.
