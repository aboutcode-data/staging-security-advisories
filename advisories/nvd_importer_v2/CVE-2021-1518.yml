summary: A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) On-Box Software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying
  operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization
  of user input on specific REST API commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
