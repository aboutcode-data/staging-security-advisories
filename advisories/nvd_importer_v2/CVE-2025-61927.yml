aliases: []
summary: Happy DOM is a JavaScript implementation of a web browser without its graphical user
  interface. Happy DOM v19 and lower contains a security vulnerability that puts the owner system
  at the risk of RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks. A Node.js VM Context is not an isolated
  environment, and if the user runs untrusted JavaScript code within the Happy DOM VM Context,
  it may escape the VM and get access to process level functionality. It seems like what the
  attacker can get control over depends on if the process is using ESM or CommonJS. With CommonJS
  the attacker can get hold of the `require()` function to import modules. Happy DOM has JavaScript
  evaluation enabled by default. This may not be obvious to the consumer of Happy DOM and can
  potentially put the user at risk if untrusted code is executed within the environment. Version
  20.0.0 patches the issue by changing JavaScript evaluation to be disabled by default.
