aliases: []
summary: An insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in the BentoML framework, allowing
  remote code execution (RCE) by sending a specially crafted POST request. By exploiting this
  vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the BentoML
  application. The vulnerability is triggered when a serialized object, crafted to execute OS
  commands upon deserialization, is sent to any valid BentoML endpoint. This issue poses a significant
  security risk, enabling attackers to compromise the server and potentially gain unauthorized
  access or control.
