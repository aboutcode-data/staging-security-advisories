summary: "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort 3 HTTP Decoder\
  \ that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort 3 Detection Engine\
  \ to restart.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of complete error checking when the\
  \ MIME fields of the HTTP header are parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending crafted HTTP packets through an established connection to be parsed by Snort\
  \ 3. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition when the Snort\
  \ 3 Detection Engine unexpectedly restarts."
