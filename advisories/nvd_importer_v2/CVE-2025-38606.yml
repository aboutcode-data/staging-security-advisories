  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: ath12k: Avoid accessing uninitialized arvif->ar during beacon miss

  During beacon miss handling, ath12k driver iterates over active virtual
  interfaces (vifs) and attempts to access the radio object (ar) via
  arvif->deflink->ar.

  However, after commit aa80f12f3bed ("wifi: ath12k: defer vdev creation for
  MLO"), arvif is linked to a radio only after vdev creation, typically when
  a channel is assigned or a scan is requested.
  For P2P capable devices, a default P2P interface is created by
  wpa_supplicant along with regular station interfaces, these serve as dummy
  interfaces for P2P-capable stations, lack an associated netdev and initiate
  frequent scans to discover neighbor p2p devices. When a scan is initiated
  on such P2P vifs, driver selects destination radio (ar) based on scan
  frequency, creates a scan vdev, and attaches arvif to the radio. Once the
  scan completes or is aborted, the scan vdev is deleted, detaching arvif
  from the radio and leaving arvif->ar uninitialized.

  While handling beacon miss for station interfaces, P2P interface is also
  encountered in the vif iteration and ath12k_mac_handle_beacon_miss_iter()
  tries to dereference the uninitialized arvif->deflink->ar.

  Fix this by verifying that vdev is created for the arvif before accessing
  its ar during beacon miss handling and similar vif iterator callbacks.
