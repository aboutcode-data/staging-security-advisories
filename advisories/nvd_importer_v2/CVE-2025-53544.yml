aliases: []
summary: Trilium Notes is an open-source, cross-platform hierarchical note taking application
  with focus on building large personal knowledge bases. In versions below 0.97.0, a brute-force
  protection bypass in the initial sync seed retrieval endpoint allows unauthenticated attackers
  to guess the login password without triggering rate limiting. Trilium is a single-user app
  without a username requirement, and brute-force protection bypass makes exploitation much
  more feasible. Multiple features provided by Trilium (e.g. MFA, share notes, custom request
  handler) indicate that Trilium can be exposed to the internet. This is fixed in version 0.97.0.
