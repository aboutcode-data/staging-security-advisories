summary: The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including,
  1.6.8.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly
  validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
