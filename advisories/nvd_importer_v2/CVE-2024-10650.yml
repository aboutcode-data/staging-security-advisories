aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was identified in ChuanhuChatGPT
  version 20240918, which could be exploited by sending large data payloads using a multipart
  boundary. Although a patch was applied for CVE-2024-7807, the issue can still be exploited
  by sending data in groups with 10 characters in a line, with multiple lines. This can cause
  the system to continuously process these characters, resulting in prolonged unavailability
  of the service. The exploitation now requires low privilege if authentication is enabled due
  to a version upgrade in Gradio.
