summary: "Sony XAV-AX5500 CarPlay TLV Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.\
  \ This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected\
  \ installations of \tSony XAV-AX5500 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this\
  \ vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the Apple CarPlay\
  \ protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied\
  \ data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage\
  \ this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.\n\nWas ZDI-CAN-23238"
