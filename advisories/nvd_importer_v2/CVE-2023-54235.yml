  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI/DOE: Fix destroy_work_on_stack() race

  The following debug object splat was observed in testing:

    ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: 0000000097d23782 object type: work_struct hint: doe_statemachine_work+0x0/0x510
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 71 at lib/debugobjects.c:514 debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0
    ...
    Workqueue: pci 0000:36:00.0 DOE [1 doe_statemachine_work
    RIP: 0010:debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0
    ...
    Call Trace:
     ? debug_print_object+0x7d/0xb0
     ? __pfx_doe_statemachine_work+0x10/0x10
     debug_object_free.part.0+0x11b/0x150
     doe_statemachine_work+0x45e/0x510
     process_one_work+0x1d4/0x3c0

  This occurs because destroy_work_on_stack() was called after signaling
  the completion in the calling thread.  This creates a race between
  destroy_work_on_stack() and the task->work struct going out of scope in
  pci_doe().

  Signal the work complete after destroying the work struct.  This is safe
  because signal_task_complete() is the final thing the work item does and
  the workqueue code is careful not to access the work struct after.
