aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Wing FTP Server 6.2.5 before February 2020. Due to insecure
  permissions when handling session cookies, a local user may view the contents of the session
  and session_admin directories, which expose active session cookies within the Wing FTP HTTP
  interface and administration panel. These cookies may be used to hijack user and administrative
  sessions, including the ability to execute Lua commands as root within the administration
  panel.
