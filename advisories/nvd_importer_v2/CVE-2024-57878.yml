  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_FPMR

  Currently fpmr_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'fpmr' variable,
  and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this
  uninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to
  target->thread.uw.fpmr, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from
  the kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,
  and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.

  Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset
  from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,
  NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing
  contents of FPMR will be retained.

  Before this patch:

  | # ./fpmr-test
  | Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d
  | SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) wrote 8 bytes
  |
  | Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr
  | GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes
  | Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d
  |
  | Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR (zero length)
  | SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=0) wrote 0 bytes
  |
  | Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr
  | GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes
  | Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0xffff800083963d50

  After this patch:

  | # ./fpmr-test
  | Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d
  | SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) wrote 8 bytes
  |
  | Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr
  | GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes
  | Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d
  |
  | Attempting to write NT_ARM_FPMR (zero length)
  | SETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=0) wrote 0 bytes
  |
  | Attempting to read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr
  | GETREGSET(nt=0x40e, len=8) read 8 bytes
  | Read NT_ARM_FPMR::fpmr = 0x900d900d900d900d
