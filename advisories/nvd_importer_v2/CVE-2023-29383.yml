aliases: []
summary: 'In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fields provided to
  the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it is not possible to exploit this directly
  (e.g., adding a new user fails because \n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent
  the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around
  blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been
  added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take
  the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that
  "cat /etc/passwd" shows a rogue user account.'
