aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of TCP packets to a
  specific port on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust
  system memory, which could cause the device to reload unexpectedly. No manual intervention
  is needed to recover the device after it has reloaded.
