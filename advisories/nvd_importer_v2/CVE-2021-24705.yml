aliases: []
summary: The NEX-Forms WordPress plugin before 8.4.3 does not have CSRF checks in place when
  editing a form, and does not escape some of its settings as well as form fields before outputting
  them in attributes. This could allow attackers to make a logged in admin edit arbitrary forms
  with Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them
