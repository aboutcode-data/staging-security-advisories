aliases: []
summary: The Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.9. This
  is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. These
  actions may result in form deletion, and lead signup as well as file upload.
