aliases: []
summary: The Tablesome Table – Contact Form DB – WPForms, CF7, Gravity, Forminator, Fluent plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation
  in the set_featured_image_from_external_url() function in all versions up to, and including,
  1.1.32. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on
  the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible in configurations
  where unauthenticated users have been provided with a method for adding featured images, and
  the workflow trigger is created.
