summary: Mantis Bug Tracker (MantisBT) is an open source issue tracker. In versions 2.27.1 and
  below, when a user edits their profile to change their e-mail address, the system saves it
  without validating that it actually belongs to the user. This could result in storing an invalid
  email address, preventing the user from receiving system notifications. Notifications sent
  to another person's email address could lead to information disclosure. This issue is fixed
  in version 2.27.2.
