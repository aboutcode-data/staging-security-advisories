aliases: []
summary: HedgeDoc is a platform to write and share markdown. HedgeDoc before version 1.8.2 is
  vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack using the YAML-metadata of a note. An attacker
  with write access to a note can embed HTML tags in the Open Graph metadata section of the
  note, resulting in the frontend rendering the script tag as part of the `<head>` section.
  Unless your instance prevents guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows unauthenticated
  attackers to inject JavaScript into notes that allow guest edits. If your instance prevents
  guests from editing notes, this vulnerability allows authenticated attackers to inject JavaScript
  into any note pages they have write-access to. This vulnerability is patched in version 1.8.2.
  As a workaround, one can disable guest edits until the next update.
