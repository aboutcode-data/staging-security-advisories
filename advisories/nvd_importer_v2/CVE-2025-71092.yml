  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix OOB write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats()

  Commit ef56081d1864 ("RDMA/bnxt_re: RoCE related hardware counters
  update") added three new counters and placed them after
  BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR.

  BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR acts as a boundary marker for allocating hardware
  statistics with different num_counters values on chip_gen_p5_p7 devices.

  As a result, BNXT_RE_NUM_STD_COUNTERS are used when allocating
  hw_stats, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in
  bnxt_re_copy_err_stats().

  The counters BNXT_RE_REQ_CQE_ERROR, BNXT_RE_RESP_CQE_ERROR, and
  BNXT_RE_RESP_REMOTE_ACCESS_ERRS are applicable to generic hardware, not
  only p5/p7 devices.

  Fix this by moving these counters before BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR so they
  are included in the generic counter set.
