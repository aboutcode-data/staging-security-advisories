aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot

  We could leak stack memory through the payload field when running
  AES with a key from one of the hardware's key slots. Fix this by
  ensuring the payload field is set to 0 in such cases.

  This does not affect the common use case when the key is supplied
  from main memory via the descriptor payload.
