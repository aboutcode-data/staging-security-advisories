aliases: []
summary: Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth
  and OpenId Connect access tokens. HTTP Clients created by `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` may
  use a different user's access token after a token refresh occurs. This occurs because a refreshed
  token will be captured in pooled `HttpClient` instances, which may be used by a different
  user. Instead of using `AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient` to create an `HttpClient` that automatically
  adds a managed token to outgoing requests, you can use the `HttpConext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync`
  extension method or the `IUserTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync` method. This issue
  is fixed in Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect 3.0.1. All users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
