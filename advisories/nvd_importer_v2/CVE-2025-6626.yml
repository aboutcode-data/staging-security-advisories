summary: The ShortPixel Adaptive Images – WebP, AVIF, CDN, Image Optimization plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the API URL Setting in all versions up to,
  and including, 3.10.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes

  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
  affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
