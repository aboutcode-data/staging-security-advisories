aliases: []
summary: 'Kirby is an open source file structured CMS ### Impact Kirby''s writer field stores
  its formatted content as HTML code. Unlike with other field types, it is not possible to escape
  HTML special characters against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, otherwise the formatting
  would be lost. If the user is logged in to the Panel, a harmful script can for example trigger
  requests to Kirby''s API with the permissions of the victim. Because the writer field did
  not securely sanitize its contents on save, it was possible to inject malicious HTML code
  into the content file by sending it to Kirby''s API directly without using the Panel. This
  malicious HTML code would then be displayed on the site frontend and executed in the browsers
  of site visitors and logged in users who are browsing the site. Attackers must be in your
  group of authenticated Panel users in order to exploit this weakness. Users who do not make
  use of the writer field are not affected. This issue has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8 by sanitizing
  all writer field contents on the backend whenever the content is modified via Kirby''s API.
  Please update to this or a later version to fix the vulnerability.'
