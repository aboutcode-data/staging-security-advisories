aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: imx: clk-imx8mp: improve error handling in imx8mp_clocks_probe()

  Replace of_iomap() and kzalloc() with devm_of_iomap() and devm_kzalloc()
  which can automatically release the related memory when the device
  or driver is removed or unloaded to avoid potential memory leak.

  In this case, iounmap(anatop_base) in line 427,433 are removed
  as manual release is not required.

  Besides, referring to clk-imx8mq.c, check the return code of
  of_clk_add_hw_provider, if it returns negtive, print error info
  and unregister hws, which makes the program more robust.
