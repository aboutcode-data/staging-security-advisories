aliases: []
summary: clamscan through 1.2.0 is vulnerable to Command Injection. It is possible to inject
  arbitrary commands as part of the `_is_clamav_binary` function located within `Index.js`.
  It should be noted that this vulnerability requires a pre-requisite that a folder should be
  created with the same command that will be chained to execute. This lowers the risk of this
  issue.
