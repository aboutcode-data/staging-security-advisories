aliases: []
summary: The cacheservice API could be abused to indirectly inject parameters with SQL syntax
  which was insufficiently sanitized and would later be executed when creating new cache groups.
  Attackers with access to a local or restricted network could perform arbitrary SQL queries.
  We have improved the input check for API calls and filter for potentially malicious content.
  No publicly available exploits are known.
