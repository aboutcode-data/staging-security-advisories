aliases: []
summary: The Alloggio Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating
  a user's identity through the alloggio_membership_init_rest_api_facebook_login and alloggio_membership_init_rest_api_google_login
  functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including
  administrators, without knowing a password.
