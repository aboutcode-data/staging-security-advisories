summary: 'Buffer overflow in the font command of mIRC, probably 6.16, allows local users to
  execute arbitrary code via a long string. NOTE: the original researcher claims that issue
  has been disputed by the vendor, and that the vendor stated "as far as I can tell, this is
  neither an exploit nor a vulnerability.  The above report describes a local bug in mIRC."  It
  could be that this is only exploitable by the user of the application, and thus would not
  cross privilege boundaries unless under an otherwise restrictive environment such as a kiosk'
