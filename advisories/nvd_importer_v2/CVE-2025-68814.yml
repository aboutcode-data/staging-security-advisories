  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring: fix filename leak in __io_openat_prep()

   __io_openat_prep() allocates a struct filename using getname(). However,
  for the condition of the file being installed in the fixed file table as
  well as having O_CLOEXEC flag set, the function returns early. At that
  point, the request doesn't have REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP flag set. Due to this,
  the memory for the newly allocated struct filename is not cleaned up,
  causing a memory leak.

  Fix this by setting the REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP for the request just after the
  successful getname() call, so that when the request is torn down, the
  filename will be cleaned up, along with other resources needing cleanup.
