aliases: []
summary: Sliver is a command and control framework that uses a custom Wireguard netstack. In
  versions 1.5.43 and earlier, and in development version 1.6.0-dev, the netstack does not limit
  traffic between Wireguard clients. This allows clients to communicate with each other unrestrictedly,
  potentially enabling leaked or recovered keypairs to be used to attack operators or allowing
  port forwardings to be accessible from other implants.
