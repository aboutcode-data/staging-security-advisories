  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free and race in fastrpc_map_find

  Currently, there is a race window between the point when the mutex is
  unlocked in fastrpc_map_lookup and the reference count increasing
  (fastrpc_map_get) in fastrpc_map_find, which can also lead to
  use-after-free.

  So lets merge fastrpc_map_find into fastrpc_map_lookup which allows us
  to both protect the maps list by also taking the &fl->lock spinlock and
  the reference count, since the spinlock will be released only after.
  Add take_ref argument to make this suitable for all callers.
