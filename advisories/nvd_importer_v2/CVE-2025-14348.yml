aliases: []
summary: The weMail - Email Marketing, Lead Generation, Optin Forms, Email Newsletters, A/B
  Testing, and Automation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This is due to the plugin's REST API trusting the `x-wemail-user`
  HTTP header to identify users without verifying the request originates from an authenticated
  WordPress session. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know or can guess
  an admin email (easily enumerable via `/wp-json/wp/v2/users`) to impersonate that user and
  access the CSV subscriber endpoints, potentially exfiltrating subscriber PII (emails, names,
  phone numbers) from imported CSV files.
