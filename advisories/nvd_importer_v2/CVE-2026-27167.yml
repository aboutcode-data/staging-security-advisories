aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. Starting in
  version 4.16.0 and prior to version 6.6.0, Gradio applications running outside of Hugging
  Face Spaces automatically enable "mocked" OAuth routes when OAuth components (e.g. `gr.LoginButton`)
  are used. When a user visits `/login/huggingface`, the server retrieves its own Hugging Face
  access token via `huggingface_hub.get_token()` and stores it in the visitor's session cookie.
  If the application is network-accessible, any remote attacker can trigger this flow to steal
  the server owner's HF token. The session cookie is signed with a hardcoded secret derived
  from the string `"-v4"`, making the payload trivially decodable. Version 6.6.0 fixes the issue.
