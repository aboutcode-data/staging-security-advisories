summary: The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress, used by the Woffice Theme, is vulnerable to
  arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'saveFeaturedImage' function

  with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
