aliases: []
summary: google-translate-api-browser is an npm package which interfaces with the google translate
  web api. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability is present in applications utilizing
  the `google-translate-api-browser` package and exposing the `translateOptions` to the end
  user. An attacker can set a malicious `tld`, causing the application to return unsafe URLs
  pointing towards local resources. The `translateOptions.tld` field is not properly sanitized
  before being placed in the Google translate URL. This can allow an attacker with control over
  the `translateOptions` to set the `tld` to a payload such as `@127.0.0.1`. This causes the
  full URL to become `https://translate.google.@127.0.0.1/...`, where `translate.google.` is
  the username used to connect to localhost. An attacker can send requests within internal networks
  and the local host. Should any HTTPS application be present on the internal network with a
  vulnerability exploitable via a GET call, then it would be possible to exploit this using
  this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.1.3. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
