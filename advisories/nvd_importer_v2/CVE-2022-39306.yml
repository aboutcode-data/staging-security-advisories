aliases: []
summary: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions prior
  to 9.2.4, or 8.5.15 on the 8.X branch, are subject to Improper Input Validation. Grafana admins
  can invite other members to the organization they are an admin for. When admins add members
  to the organization, non existing users get an email invite, existing members are added directly
  to the organization. When an invite link is sent, it allows users to sign up with whatever
  username/email address the user chooses and become a member of the organization. This introduces
  a vulnerability which can be used with malicious intent. This issue is patched in version
  9.2.4, and has been backported to 8.5.15. There are no known workarounds.
