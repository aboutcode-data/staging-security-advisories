summary: 'Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Atsphp 5.0.1 allow remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the CONF[path] parameter to (1) index.php, (2)
  sources/usercp.php, or (3) sources/admin.php.  NOTE: Another researcher has disputed this
  vulnerability, noting that CONF[path] is defined before use in index.php, that CONF[path]
  inclusion cannot occur through a direct request to other affected files, and that usercp.php
  is a typo of user_cp.php'
