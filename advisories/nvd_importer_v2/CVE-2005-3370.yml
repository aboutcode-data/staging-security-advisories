aliases: []
summary: Multiple interpretation error in ArcaVir 2005 package 2005-06-21 allows remote attackers
  to bypass virus scanning via a file such as BAT, HTML, and EML with an "MZ" magic byte sequence
  which is normally associated with EXE, which causes the file to be treated as a safe type
  that could still be executed as a dangerous file type by applications on the end system, as
  demonstrated by a "triple headed" program that contains EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka the
  "magic byte bug."
