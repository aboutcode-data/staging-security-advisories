summary: The parisneo/lollms-webui repository is susceptible to a path traversal vulnerability
  due to inadequate validation of user-supplied file paths. This flaw allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to read, write, and in certain configurations execute arbitrary files on the server
  by exploiting various endpoints. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the service
  is bound to localhost, through cross-site requests facilitated by malicious HTML/JS pages.
