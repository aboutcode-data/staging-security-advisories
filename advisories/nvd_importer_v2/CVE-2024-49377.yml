aliases: []
summary: OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint
  versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the login
  dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog.  An attacker who successfully
  talked a victim into clicking on a specially crafted login link, or a malicious app running
  on a victim's computer triggering the application key workflow with specially crafted parameters
  and then redirecting the victim to the related standalone confirmation dialog could use this
  to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact
  with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The above mentioned specific vulnerabilities
  of the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog have been patched
  in the bugfix release 1.10.3 by individual escaping of the detected locations. A global change
  throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle
  this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack
  surface in general. The latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During
  a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping.
  With OctoPrint 1.13.0, automatic escaping will be switched over to be enforced even for third
  party plugins, unless they explicitly opt-out.
