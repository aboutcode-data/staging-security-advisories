summary: October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework.
  A bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469 and 1.1.0) was discovered that has the same impact
  as CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts,
  or cms.manage_partials permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code
  to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific
  Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for
  anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within
  the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying
  on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have
  access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) and
  v1.1.1.
