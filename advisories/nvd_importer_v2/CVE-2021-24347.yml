summary: The SP Project & Document Manager WordPress plugin before 4.22 allows users to upload
  files, however, the plugin attempts to prevent php and other similar files that could be executed
  on the server from being uploaded by checking the file extension. It was discovered that php
  files could still be uploaded by changing the file extension's case, for example, from "php"
  to "pHP".
