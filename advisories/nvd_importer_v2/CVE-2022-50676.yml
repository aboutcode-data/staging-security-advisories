  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: rds: don't hold sock lock when cancelling work from rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()

  syzbot is reporting lockdep warning at rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() [1], for
  commit ac3615e7f3cffe2a ("RDS: TCP: Reduce code duplication in
  rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()") added cancel_delayed_work_sync() into a section
  protected by lock_sock() without realizing that rds_send_xmit() might call
  lock_sock().

  We don't need to protect cancel_delayed_work_sync() using lock_sock(), for
  even if rds_{send,recv}_worker() re-queued this work while __flush_work()
   from cancel_delayed_work_sync() was waiting for this work to complete,
  retried rds_{send,recv}_worker() is no-op due to the absence of RDS_CONN_UP
  bit.
