summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings could have allowed an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to redirect a targeted Webex Meetings user to an untrusted website. Cisco has addressed\
  \ this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability existed because of insufficient validation of URLs that were included\
  \ in a meeting-join URL. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have\
  \ exploited this vulnerability by including a URL to a website of their choosing in a specific\
  \ value of a Cisco Webex Meetings join URL. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker\
  \ to redirect a targeted user to a website that was controlled by the attacker, possibly making\
  \ the user more likely to believe the website was trusted by Webex and perform additional\
  \ actions as part of phishing attacks."
