summary: The AI Image Lab – Free AI Image Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect

  to update the plugin's API key via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
