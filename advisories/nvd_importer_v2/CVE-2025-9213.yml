aliases: []
summary: The TextBuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  versions 1.0.0 to 1.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'handleToken'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update a user's authorization
  token via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link. Once the token is updated, an attacker can update the user's
  password and email address.
