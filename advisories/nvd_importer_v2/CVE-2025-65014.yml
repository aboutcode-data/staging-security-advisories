summary: LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Prior
  to version 25.11.0, a weak password policy vulnerability was identified in the user management
  functionality of the LibreNMS application. This vulnerability allows administrators to create
  accounts with extremely weak and predictable passwords, such as 12345678. This exposes the
  platform to brute-force and credential stuffing attacks. This issue has been patched in version
  25.11.0.
