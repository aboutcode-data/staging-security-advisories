aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Prior to version 8.0.0, the OpenEMR application is vulnerable to an access control
  flaw that allows low-privileged users, such as receptionists, to export the entire message
  list containing sensitive patient and user data. The vulnerability lies in the message_list.php
  report export functionality, where there is no permission check before executing sensitive
  database queries. The only control in place is CSRF token verification, which does not prevent
  unauthorized data access if the token is acquired through other means. Version 8.0.0 fixes
  the vulnerability.
