  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841

  The blamed commit started to use the ptp workqueue to get the second
  part of the timestamp. And when the port was set down, then this
  workqueue is stopped. But if the config option NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING
  is not enabled, then the ptp_clock is not initialized so then it would
  crash when it would try to access the delayed work.
  So then basically by setting up and then down the port, it would crash.
  The fix consists in checking if the ptp_clock is initialized and only
  then cancel the delayed work.
