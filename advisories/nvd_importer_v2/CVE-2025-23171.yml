aliases: []
summary: "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform provides an option to upload various\
  \ types of files. The Versa Director does not correctly limit file upload permissions. The\
  \ UI appears not to allow file uploads but uploads still succeed. In addition, the Versa Director\
  \ discloses the full filename of uploaded temporary files, including the UUID prefix. Insecure\
  \ UCPE image upload in Versa Director allows an authenticated attacker to upload a webshell.\
  \ \r\n\r\nExploitation Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance\
  \ where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been\
  \ disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\
  \nThere are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded\
  \ to one of the remediated software versions."
