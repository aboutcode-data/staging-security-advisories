aliases: []
summary: The Default Thumbnail Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'get_cache_image' function in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.0.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
  remote code execution possible.
