summary: A carefully crafted invocation on the Image plugin could trigger an CSRF vulnerability
  on Apache JSPWiki before 2.11.3, which could allow a group privilege escalation of the attacker's
  account. Further examination of this issue established that it could also be used to modify
  the email associated with the attacked account, and then a reset password request from the
  login page.
