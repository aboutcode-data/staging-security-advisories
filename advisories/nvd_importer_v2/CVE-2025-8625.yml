aliases: []
summary: The Copypress Rest API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
  via copyreap_handle_image() Function in versions 1.1 to 1.2. The plugin falls back to a hard-coded
  JWT signing key when no secret is defined and does not restrict which file types can be fetched
  and saved as attachments. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can forge a valid token to
  gain elevated privileges and upload an arbitrary file (e.g. a PHP script) through the image
  handler, leading to remote code execution.
