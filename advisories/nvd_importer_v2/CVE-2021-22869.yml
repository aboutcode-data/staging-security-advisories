aliases: []
summary: An improper access control vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed a workflow
  job to execute in a self-hosted runner group it should not have had access to. This affects
  customers using self-hosted runner groups for access control. A repository with access to
  one enterprise runner group could access all of the enterprise runner groups within the organization
  because of improper authentication checks during the request. This could cause code to be
  run unintentionally by the incorrect runner group. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise
  Server versions from 3.0.0 to 3.0.15 and 3.1.0 to 3.1.7 and was fixed in 3.0.16 and 3.1.8
  releases.
