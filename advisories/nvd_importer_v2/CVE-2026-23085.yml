  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  irqchip/gic-v3-its: Avoid truncating memory addresses

  On 32-bit machines with CONFIG_ARM_LPAE, it is possible for lowmem
  allocations to be backed by addresses physical memory above the 32-bit
  address limit, as found while experimenting with larger VMSPLIT
  configurations.

  This caused the qemu virt model to crash in the GICv3 driver, which
  allocates the 'itt' object using GFP_KERNEL. Since all memory below
  the 4GB physical address limit is in ZONE_DMA in this configuration,
  kmalloc() defaults to higher addresses for ZONE_NORMAL, and the
  ITS driver stores the physical address in a 32-bit 'unsigned long'
  variable.

  Change the itt_addr variable to the correct phys_addr_t type instead,
  along with all other variables in this driver that hold a physical
  address.

  The gicv5 driver correctly uses u64 variables, while all other irqchip
  drivers don't call virt_to_phys or similar interfaces. It's expected that
  other device drivers have similar issues, but fixing this one is
  sufficient for booting a virtio based guest.
