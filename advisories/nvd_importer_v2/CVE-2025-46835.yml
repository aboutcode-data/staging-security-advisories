summary: Git GUI allows you to use the Git source control management tools via a GUI. When a
  user clones an untrusted repository and is tricked into editing a file located in a maliciously
  named directory in the repository, then Git GUI can create and overwrite files for which the
  user has write permission. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4,
  2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50.1.
