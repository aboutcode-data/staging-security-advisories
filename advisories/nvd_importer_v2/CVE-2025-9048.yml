aliases: []
summary: The Wptobe-memberships plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to insufficient file path validation in the del_img_ajax_call() function in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.4.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
  code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
