aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client for Linux 1.5 through
  2.3+ allows remote attackers to bypass an intended VPN kill switch mechanism and read sensitive
  information via intercepting network traffic. Since 1.5, PIA has supported a “split tunnel”
  OpenVPN bypass option. The PIA killswitch & associated iptables firewall is designed to protect
  you while using the Internet. When the kill switch is configured to block all inbound and
  outbound network traffic, privileged applications can continue sending & receiving network
  traffic if net.ipv4.ip_forward has been enabled in the system kernel parameters. For example,
  a Docker container running on a host with the VPN turned off, and the kill switch turned on,
  can continue using the internet, leaking the host IP (CWE 200). In PIA 2.4.0+, policy-based
  routing is enabled by default and is used to direct all forwarded packets to the VPN interface
  automatically.
