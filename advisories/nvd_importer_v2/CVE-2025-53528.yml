summary: Cadwyn creates production-ready community-driven modern Stripe-like API versioning
  in FastAPI. In versions before 5.4.3, the version parameter of the "/docs" endpoint is vulnerable
  to a Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. This XSS would notably allow an attacker
  to execute JavaScript code on a user's session for any application based on Cadwyn via a one-click
  attack. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 5.4.3.
