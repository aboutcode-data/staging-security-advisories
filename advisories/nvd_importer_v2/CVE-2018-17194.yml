aliases: []
summary: 'When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes in the cluster
  for verification, the Content-Length was forwarded. On a DELETE request, the body was ignored,
  but if the initial request had a Content-Length value other than 0, the receiving nodes would
  wait for the body and eventually timeout. Mitigation: The fix to check DELETE requests and
  overwrite non-zero Content-Length header values was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release.
  Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.'
