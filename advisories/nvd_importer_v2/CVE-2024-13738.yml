summary: "The The Motors - Car Dealer, Rental & Listing WordPress theme theme for WordPress\
  \ is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.65.\
  \ This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate\
  \ a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers\
  \ to execute arbitrary shortcodes.\r\n\r\n*It is unclear exactly which version the issue was\
  \ patched in from the changelog. Therefore, we used the latest version at the time of verification."
