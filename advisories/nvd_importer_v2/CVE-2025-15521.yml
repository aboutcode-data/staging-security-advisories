aliases: []
summary: The Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
  3.5.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating
  their password and relying solely on a publicly-exposed nonce for authorization. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's password, including administrators,
  and gain access to their account.
