aliases: []
summary: Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior
  to version 1.7.0, if an arbitrary path is specified in the request body's `fs_path`, the server
  serializes the Flow object into JSON and creates/overwrites a file at that path. There is
  no path restriction, normalization, or allowed directory enforcement, so absolute paths (e.g.,
  /etc/poc.txt) are interpreted as is. Version 1.7.0 fixes the issue.
