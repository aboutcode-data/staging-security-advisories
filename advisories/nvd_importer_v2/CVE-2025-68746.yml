  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling

  When the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)
  is excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not
  running before the transfer timeout is reached.

  While handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and
  the message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves
  the curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.

  To avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this
  condition when the IRQ thread is finally run.

  While at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new
  interrupts can be run.

  A better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a
  hard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ
  thread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the
  extra check for a valid transfer.
