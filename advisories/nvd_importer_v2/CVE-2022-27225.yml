aliases: []
summary: Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.3 relies on cleartext data transmission in some situations.
  It uses Keycloak for identity management services. During the sign-in process, Keycloak sets
  browser cookies that effectively provide remember-me functionality. For backwards compatibility
  with older Safari versions, Keycloak sets a duplicate of the cookie without the Secure attribute,
  which allows the cookie to be sent when accessing the location that cookie is set for via
  HTTP. This creates the potential for an attacker (with the ability to impersonate the Gradle
  Enterprise host) to capture the login session of a user by having them click an http:// link
  to the server, despite the real server requiring HTTPS.
