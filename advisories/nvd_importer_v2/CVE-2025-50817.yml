aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Python-Future 1.0.0 module allows for arbitrary code execution
  via the unintended import of a file named test.py. When the module is loaded, it automatically
  imports test.py, if present in the same directory or in the sys.path. This behavior can be
  exploited by an attacker who has the ability to write files to the server, allowing the execution
  of arbitrary code. NOTE: Multiple third parties have disputed this issue and stated that it
  is not a security flaw in python-future and is a documented feature of Python’s import system
  in the handling of sys.path.'
