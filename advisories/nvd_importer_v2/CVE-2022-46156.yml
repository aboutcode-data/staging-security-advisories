aliases: []
summary: The Synthetic Monitoring Agent for Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring application provides
  probe functionality and executes network checks for monitoring remote targets. Users running
  the Synthetic Monitoring agent prior to version 0.12.0 in their local network are impacted.
  The authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring API is exposed
  through a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring
  checks created by the user and assigned to the agent identified with that token. The Synthetic
  Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected agents, so access to the token
  does not guarantee access to the checks. Version 0.12.0 contains a fix. Users are advised
  to rotate the agent tokens. After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later, it's recommended
  that users of distribution packages review the configuration stored in `/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf`,
  specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to `SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`. As a
  workaround for previous versions, it's recommended that users review the agent settings and
  set the HTTP listening address in a manner that limits the exposure, for example, localhost
  or a non-routed network, by using the command line parameter `-listen-address`, e.g. `-listen-address
  localhost:4050`.
