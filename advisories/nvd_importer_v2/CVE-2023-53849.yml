  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/msm: fix workqueue leak on bind errors

  Make sure to destroy the workqueue also in case of early errors during
  bind (e.g. a subcomponent failing to bind).

  Since commit c3b790ea07a1 ("drm: Manage drm_mode_config_init with
  drmm_") the mode config will be freed when the drm device is released
  also when using the legacy interface, but add an explicit cleanup for
  consistency and to facilitate backporting.
