aliases: []
summary: Local Deep Research is an AI-powered research assistant for deep, iterative research.
  In versions from 1.3.0 to before 1.3.9, the download service (download_service.py) makes HTTP
  requests using raw requests.get() without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (safe_requests.py).
  This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud provider metadata
  endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network reconnaissance, by submitting
  malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment and surrounding controls. This
  issue has been patched in version 1.3.9.
