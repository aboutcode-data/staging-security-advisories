aliases: []
summary: The WP Magazine Modules Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2 via the 'blockLayout' parameter. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include
  and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those
  files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code
  execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
