aliases: []
summary: The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
  input via the 'images_array' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.8. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to call files using a
  PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform
  a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that
  the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
