  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/mediatek: Fix device use-after-free on unbind

  A recent change fixed device reference leaks when looking up drm
  platform device driver data during bind() but failed to remove a partial
  fix which had been added by commit 80805b62ea5b ("drm/mediatek: Fix
  kobject put for component sub-drivers").

  This results in a reference imbalance on component bind() failures and
  on unbind() which could lead to a user-after-free.

  Make sure to only drop the references after retrieving the driver data
  by effectively reverting the previous partial fix.

  Note that holding a reference to a device does not prevent its driver
  data from going away so there is no point in keeping the reference.
