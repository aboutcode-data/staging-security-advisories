aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the malware detection functionality within Advanced Malware Protection
  (AMP) of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESAs) could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an email attachment containing malware to be delivered
  to the end user. The vulnerability is due to the failure of AMP to scan certain EML attachments
  that could contain malware. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email
  with a crafted EML attachment through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to bypass the configured ESA email message and content filtering and allow the
  malware to be delivered to the end user. Vulnerable Products: This vulnerability affects Cisco
  AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA, both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured
  with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments on the ESA. Cisco Bug IDs:
  CSCuz81533.'
