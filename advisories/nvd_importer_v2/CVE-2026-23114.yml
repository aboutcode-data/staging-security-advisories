  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Fix SVE writes on !SME systems

  When SVE is supported but SME is not supported, a ptrace write to the
  NT_ARM_SVE regset can place the tracee into an invalid state where
  (non-streaming) SVE register data is stored in FP_STATE_SVE format but
  TIF_SVE is clear. This can result in a later warning from
  fpsimd_restore_current_state(), e.g.

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 7214 at arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.c:383 fpsimd_restore_current_state+0x50c/0x748

  When this happens, fpsimd_restore_current_state() will set TIF_SVE,
  placing the task into the correct state. This occurs before any other
  check of TIF_SVE can possibly occur, as other checks of TIF_SVE only
  happen while the FPSIMD/SVE/SME state is live. Thus, aside from the
  warning, there is no functional issue.

  This bug was introduced during rework to error handling in commit:

    9f8bf718f2923 ("arm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Gracefully handle errors")

  ... where the setting of TIF_SVE was moved into a block which is only
  executed when system_supports_sme() is true.

  Fix this by removing the system_supports_sme() check. This ensures that
  TIF_SVE is set for (SVE-formatted) writes to NT_ARM_SVE, at the cost of
  unconditionally manipulating the tracee's saved svcr value. The
  manipulation of svcr is benign and inexpensive, and we already do
  similar elsewhere (e.g. during signal handling), so I don't think it's
  worth guarding this with system_supports_sme() checks.

  Aside from the above, there is no functional change. The 'type' argument
  to sve_set_common() is only set to ARM64_VEC_SME (in ssve_set())) when
  system_supports_sme(), so the ARM64_VEC_SME case in the switch statement
  is still unreachable when !system_supports_sme(). When
  CONFIG_ARM64_SME=n, the only caller of sve_set_common() is sve_set(),
  and the compiler can constant-fold for the case where type is
  ARM64_VEC_SVE, removing the logic for other cases.
