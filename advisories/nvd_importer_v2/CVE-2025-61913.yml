aliases: []
summary: Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model
  flow. In versions prior to 3.0.8, WriteFileTool and ReadFileTool in Flowise do not restrict
  file path access, allowing authenticated attackers to exploit this vulnerability to read and
  write arbitrary files to any path in the file system, potentially leading to remote command
  execution. Flowise 3.0.8 fixes this vulnerability.
