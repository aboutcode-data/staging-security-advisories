summary: Philips e-Alert Unit (non-medical device), Version R2.1 and prior. The software transmits

  by unauthorized actors. The Philips e-Alert communication channel is not encrypted which could
  therefore lead to disclosure of personal contact information and application login credentials
  from within the same subnet.
