aliases: []
summary: The salt.auth.pki module does not properly authenticate callers. The "password" field
  contains a public certificate which is validated against a CA certificate by the module. This
  is not pki authentication, as the caller does not need access to the corresponding private
  key for the authentication attempt to be accepted.
