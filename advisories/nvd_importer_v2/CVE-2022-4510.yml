aliases: []
summary: |
  A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction, would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.
   This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py.

  This issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.
