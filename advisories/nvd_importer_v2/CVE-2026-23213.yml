  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/amd/pm: Disable MMIO access during SMU Mode 1 reset

  During Mode 1 reset, the ASIC undergoes a reset cycle and becomes
  temporarily inaccessible via PCIe. Any attempt to access MMIO registers
  during this window (e.g., from interrupt handlers or other driver threads)
  can result in uncompleted PCIe transactions, leading to NMI panics or
  system hangs.

  To prevent this, set the `no_hw_access` flag to true immediately after
  triggering the reset. This signals other driver components to skip
  register accesses while the device is offline.

  A memory barrier `smp_mb()` is added to ensure the flag update is
  globally visible to all cores before the driver enters the sleep/wait
  state.

  (cherry picked from commit 7edb503fe4b6d67f47d8bb0dfafb8e699bb0f8a4)
