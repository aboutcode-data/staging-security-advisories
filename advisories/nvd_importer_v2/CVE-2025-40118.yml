  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: pm80xx: Fix array-index-out-of-of-bounds on rmmod

  Since commit f7b705c238d1 ("scsi: pm80xx: Set phy_attached to zero when
  device is gone") UBSAN reports:

    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_sas.c:786:17
    index 28 is out of range for type 'pm8001_phy [16]'

  on rmmod when using an expander.

  For a direct attached device, attached_phy contains the local phy id.
  For a device behind an expander, attached_phy contains the remote phy
  id, not the local phy id.

  I.e. while pm8001_ha will have pm8001_ha->chip->n_phy local phys, for a
  device behind an expander, attached_phy can be much larger than
  pm8001_ha->chip->n_phy (depending on the amount of phys of the
  expander).

  E.g. on my system pm8001_ha has 8 phys with phy ids 0-7.  One of the
  ports has an expander connected.  The expander has 31 phys with phy ids
  0-30.

  The pm8001_ha->phy array only contains the phys of the HBA.  It does not
  contain the phys of the expander.  Thus, it is wrong to use attached_phy
  to index the pm8001_ha->phy array for a device behind an expander.

  Thus, we can only clear phy_attached for devices that are directly
  attached.
