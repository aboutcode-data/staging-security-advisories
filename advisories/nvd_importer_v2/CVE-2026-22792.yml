aliases: []
summary: 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context
  protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe HTML rendering permits untrusted HTML
  (including on* event attributes) to execute in the renderer context. An attacker can inject
  an `<img onerror=...>` payload to run arbitrary JavaScript in the renderer, which can call
  exposed bridge APIs such as `window.bridge.mcpServersManager.createServer`. This enables unauthorized
  creation of MCP servers and lead to remote command execution. Version 0.15.3 fixes the issue.
