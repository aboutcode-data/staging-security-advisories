aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Wind River VxWorks 6.9 and 7. The function ``tarExtract``
  implements TAR file extraction and thereby also processes files within an archive that have
  relative or absolute file paths. A developer using the "tarExtract" function may expect that
  the function will strip leading slashes from absolute paths or stop processing when encountering
  relative paths that are outside of the extraction path, unless otherwise forced. This could
  lead to unexpected and undocumented behavior, which in general could result in a directory
  traversal, and associated unexpected behavior.
