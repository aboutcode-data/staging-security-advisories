summary: "A vulnerability in the OpenAPI of Cisco Secure Workload could allow an authenticated,\
  \ remote attacker with the privileges of a read-only user to execute operations that should\
  \ require Administrator privileges. The attacker would need valid user credentials.\r\n\r\
  \ This vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) of certain OpenAPI\
  \ operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a crafted OpenAPI function\
  \ call with valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute OpenAPI\
