aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: nf_conncount: update last_gc only when GC has been performed

  Currently last_gc is being updated everytime a new connection is
  tracked, that means that it is updated even if a GC wasn't performed.
  With a sufficiently high packet rate, it is possible to always bypass
  the GC, causing the list to grow infinitely.

  Update the last_gc value only when a GC has been actually performed.
