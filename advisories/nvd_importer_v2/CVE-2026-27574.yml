aliases: []
summary: OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. In versions 9.5.13
  and below, custom JavaScript monitor feature uses Node.js's node:vm module (explicitly documented
  as not a security mechanism) to execute user-supplied code, allowing trivial sandbox escape
  via a well-known one-liner that grants full access to the underlying process. Because the
  probe runs with host networking and holds all cluster credentials (ONEUPTIME_SECRET, DATABASE_PASSWORD,
  REDIS_PASSWORD, CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD) in its environment variables, and monitor creation is
  available to the lowest role (ProjectMember) with open registration enabled by default, any
  anonymous user can achieve full cluster compromise in about 30 seconds. This issue has been
  fixed in version 10.0.5.
