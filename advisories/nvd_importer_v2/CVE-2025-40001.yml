  scsi: mvsas: Fix use-after-free bugs in mvs_work_queue

  During the detaching of Marvell's SAS/SATA controller, the original code
  calls cancel_delayed_work() in mvs_free() to cancel the delayed work
  item mwq->work_q. However, if mwq->work_q is already running, the
  cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel it. This can lead to
  use-after-free scenarios where mvs_free() frees the mvs_info while
  mvs_work_queue() is still executing and attempts to access the
  already-freed mvs_info.

  A typical race condition is illustrated below:

  CPU 0 (remove)            | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
  mvs_pci_remove()          |
    mvs_free()              | mvs_work_queue()
      cancel_delayed_work() |
        kfree(mvi)          |
                            |   mvi-> // UAF

  Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
  that the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing
  delayed work item completes before the mvs_info is deallocated.

  This bug was found by static analysis.
