summary: lunary-ai/lunary version 1.0.1 is vulnerable to improper authorization, allowing removed
  members to read, create, modify, and delete prompt templates using an old authorization token.
  Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on
  prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token.
  This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template
  data.
