  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tracing: Add recursion protection in kernel stack trace recording

  A bug was reported about an infinite recursion caused by tracing the rcu
  events with the kernel stack trace trigger enabled. The stack trace code
  called back into RCU which then called the stack trace again.

  Expand the ftrace recursion protection to add a set of bits to protect
  events from recursion. Each bit represents the context that the event is
  in (normal, softirq, interrupt and NMI).

  Have the stack trace code use the interrupt context to protect against
  recursion.

  Note, the bug showed an issue in both the RCU code as well as the tracing
  stacktrace code. This only handles the tracing stack trace side of the
  bug. The RCU fix will be handled separately.
