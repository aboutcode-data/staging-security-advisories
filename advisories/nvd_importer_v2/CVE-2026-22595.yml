summary: Ghost is a Node.js content management system. In versions 5.121.0 through 5.130.5 and
  6.0.0 through 6.10.3, a vulnerability in Ghost's handling of Staff Token authentication allowed
  certain endpoints to be accessed that were only intended to be accessible via Staff Session
  authentication. External systems that have been authenticated via Staff Tokens for Admin/Owner-role
  users would have had access to these endpoints. This issue has been patched in versions 5.130.6
  and 6.11.0.
