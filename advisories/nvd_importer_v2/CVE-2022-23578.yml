summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. If a graph node is invalid,
  TensorFlow can leak memory in the implementation of `ImmutableExecutorState::Initialize`.
  Here, we set `item->kernel` to `nullptr` but it is a simple `OpKernel*` pointer so the memory
  that was previously allocated to it would leak. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow
  2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
