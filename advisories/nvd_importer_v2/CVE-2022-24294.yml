summary: A regular expression used in Apache MXNet (incubating) is vulnerable to a potential
  denial-of-service by excessive resource consumption. The bug could be exploited when loading
  a model in Apache MXNet that has a specially crafted operator name that would cause the regular
  expression evaluation to use excessive resources to attempt a match. This issue affects Apache
  MXNet versions prior to 1.9.1.
