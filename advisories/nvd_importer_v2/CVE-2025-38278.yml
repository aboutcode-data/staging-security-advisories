  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  octeontx2-pf: QOS: Refactor TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST callback

  This patch addresses below issues,

  1. Active traffic on the leaf node must be stopped before its send queue
     is reassigned to the parent. This patch resolves the issue by marking
     the node as 'Inner'.

  2. During a system reboot, the interface receives TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL
     and TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST callbacks to delete its HTB queues.
     In the case of TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST, although the same send queue
     is reassigned to the parent, the current logic still attempts to update
     the real number of queues, leadning to below warnings

          New queues can't be registered after device unregistration.
