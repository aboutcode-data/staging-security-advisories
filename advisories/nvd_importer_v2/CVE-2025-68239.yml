summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  binfmt_misc: restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()

  bm_register_write() opens an executable file using open_exec(), which
  internally calls do_open_execat() and denies write access on the file to
  avoid modification while it is being executed.

  However, when an error occurs, bm_register_write() closes the file using
  filp_close() directly. This does not restore the write permission, which
  may cause subsequent write operations on the same file to fail.

  Fix this by calling exe_file_allow_write_access() before filp_close() to
  restore the write permission properly.
