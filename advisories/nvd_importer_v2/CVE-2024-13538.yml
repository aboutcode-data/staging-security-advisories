aliases: []
summary: The BigBuy Dropshipping Connector for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.19. This is due the /vendor/cocur/slugify/bin/generate-default.php
  file being directly accessible and triggering an error. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other
  attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability
  to be present for damage to an affected website.
