summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe/oa: Limit num_syncs to prevent oversized allocations

  The OA open parameters did not validate num_syncs, allowing
  userspace to pass arbitrarily large values, potentially
  leading to excessive allocations.

  Add check to ensure that num_syncs does not exceed DRM_XE_MAX_SYNCS,
  returning -EINVAL when the limit is violated.

  v2: use XE_IOCTL_DBG() and drop duplicated check. (Ashutosh)

  (cherry picked from commit e057b2d2b8d815df3858a87dffafa2af37e5945b)
