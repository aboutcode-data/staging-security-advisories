aliases: []
summary: SysAid - Okta SSO integration - was found vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection
  vulnerability. Any SysAid environment that uses the Okta SSO integration might be vulnerable.
  An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability by sending a malformed POST
  request to the identity provider endpoint. An attacker can extract the identity provider endpoint
  by decoding the SAMLRequest parameter's value and searching for the AssertionConsumerServiceURL
  parameter's value. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem
  and interact with any back-end or external systems that the application can access. In some
  situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or
  other back-end infrastructure by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request
  forgery (SSRF) attacks.
