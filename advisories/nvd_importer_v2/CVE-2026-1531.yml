aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in foreman_kubevirt. When configuring the connection to OpenShift,
  the system disables SSL verification if a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate is not explicitly
  set. This insecure default allows a remote attacker, capable of intercepting network traffic
  between Satellite and OpenShift, to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Such an attack
  could lead to the disclosure or alteration of sensitive information.
