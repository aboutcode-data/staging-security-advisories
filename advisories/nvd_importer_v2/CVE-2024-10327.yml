summary: "A vulnerability in Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including\
  \ beta) allows push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature allowing\
  \ the authentication to proceed regardless of the user’s selection. When a user long-presses\
  \ the notification banner and selects an option, both options allow the authentication to\
  \ succeed. \nThe ContextExtension feature is one of several push mechanisms available when\
  \ using Okta Verify Push on iOS devices. The vulnerable flows include: \n* When a user is\
  \ presented with a notification on a locked screen, the user presses on the notification directly\
  \ and selects their reply without unlocking the device; \n* When a user is presented with\
  \ a notification on the home screen and drags the notification down and selects their reply;\
  \ \n* When an Apple Watch is used to reply directly to a notification. \n\n A pre-condition\
  \ for this vulnerability is that the user must have enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta\
  \ customer was using Okta Classic. This applies irrespective of whether the organization has\
  \ since upgraded to Okta Identity Engine."
