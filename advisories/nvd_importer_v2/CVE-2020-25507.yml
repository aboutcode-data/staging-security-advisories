aliases: []
summary: An incorrect permission assignment during the installation script of TeamworkCloud
  18.0 thru 19.0 allows a local unprivileged attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. During
  installation, the user is instructed to set the system enviroment file with world writable
  permissions (0777 /etc/environment). Any local unprivileged user can execute arbitrary code
  simply by writing to /etc/environment, which will force all users, including root, to execute
  arbitrary code during the next login or reboot. In addition, the entire home directory of
  the twcloud user at /home/twcloud is recursively given world writable permissions. This allows
  any local unprivileged attacker to execute arbitrary code, as twcloud. This product was previous
  named Cameo Enterprise Data Warehouse (CEDW).
