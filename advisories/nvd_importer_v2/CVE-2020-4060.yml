summary: In LoRa Basics Station before 2.0.4, there is a Use After Free vulnerability that leads
  to memory corruption. This bug is triggered on 32-bit machines when the CUPS server responds
  with a message (https://doc.sm.tc/station/cupsproto.html#http-post-response) where the signature
  length is larger than 2 GByte (never happens in practice), or the response is crafted specifically
  to trigger this issue (i.e. the length signature field indicates a value larger than (2**31)-1
  although the signature actually does not contain that much data). In such a scenario, on 32
  bit machines, Basic Station would execute a code path, where a piece of memory is accessed
  after it has been freed, causing the process to crash and restarted again. The CUPS transaction
  is typically mutually authenticated over TLS. Therefore, in order to trigger this vulnerability,
  the attacker would have to gain access to the CUPS server first. If the user chose to operate
  without authentication over TLS but yet is concerned about this vulnerability, one possible
  workaround is to enable TLS authentication. This has been fixed in 2.0.4.
