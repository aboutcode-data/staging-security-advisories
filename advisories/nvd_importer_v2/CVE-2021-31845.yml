aliases: []
summary: A buffer overflow vulnerability in McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Discover prior
  to 11.6.100 allows an attacker in the same network as the DLP Discover to execute arbitrary
  code through placing carefully constructed Ami Pro (.sam) files onto a machine and having
  DLP Discover scan it, leading to remote code execution with elevated privileges. This is caused
  by the destination buffer being of fixed size and incorrect checks being made on the source
  size.
