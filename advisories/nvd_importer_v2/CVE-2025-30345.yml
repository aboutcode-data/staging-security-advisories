aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When creating new chats via the
  chat_group.create action, the user is able to specify the name of the chat. Some HTML elements
  such as SCRIPT are filtered, whereas others are not. In most cases, HTML entities are encoded
  properly, but not when deleting chats or deleting messages in these chats. This potentially
  allows attackers to interfere with the layout of the rendered website, but it is unlikely
  that victims would click on deleted chats or deleted messages.
