aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  libceph: make decode_pool() more resilient against corrupted osdmaps

  If the osdmap is (maliciously) corrupted such that the encoded length
  of ceph_pg_pool envelope is less than what is expected for a particular
  encoding version, out-of-bounds reads may ensue because the only bounds
  check that is there is based on that length value.

  This patch adds explicit bounds checks for each field that is decoded
  or skipped.
