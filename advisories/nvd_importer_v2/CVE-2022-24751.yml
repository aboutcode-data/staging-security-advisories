summary: Zulip is an open source group chat application. Starting with version 4.0 and prior
  to version 4.11, Zulip is vulnerable to a race condition during account deactivation, where
  a simultaneous access by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued access
  by the deactivated user. A patch is available in version 4.11 on the 4.x branch and version
  5.0-rc1 on the 5.x branch. Upgrading to a fixed version will, as a side effect, deactivate
  any cached sessions that may have been leaked through this bug. There are currently no known
  workarounds.
