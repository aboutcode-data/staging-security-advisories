summary: The WP Company Info plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'class' attribute of the 'social-networks' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  1.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web
  scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
