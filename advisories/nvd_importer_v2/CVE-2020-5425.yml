  to 1.12.4 and 1.13.x prior to 1.13.1 are vulnerable to user impersonation attack.If two users
  are logged in to the SSO operator dashboard at the same time, with the same username, from
  two different identity providers, one can acquire the token of the other and thus operate
  with their permissions. Note: Foundation may be vulnerable only if: 1) The system zone is
  set up to use a SAML identity provider 2) There are internal users that have the same username
  as users in the external SAML provider 3) Those duplicate-named users have the scope to access
  the SSO operator dashboard 4) The vulnerability doesn''t appear with LDAP because of chained
  authentication.'
