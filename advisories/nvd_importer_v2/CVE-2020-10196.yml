aliases: []
summary: An XSS vulnerability in the popup-builder plugin before 3.64.1 for WordPress allows
  remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into existing popups via an unsecured ajax
  action in com/classes/Ajax.php. It is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to insert malicious
  JavaScript in several of the popup's fields by sending a request to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
  with the POST action parameter of sgpb_autosave and including additional data in an allPopupData
  parameter, including the popup's ID (which is visible in the source of the page in which the
  popup is inserted) and arbitrary JavaScript which will then be executed in the browsers of
  visitors to that page. Because the plugin functionality automatically adds script tags to
  data entered into these fields, this injection will typically bypass most WAF applications.
