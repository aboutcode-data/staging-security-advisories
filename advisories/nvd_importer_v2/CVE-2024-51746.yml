aliases: []
summary: Gitsign is a keyless Sigstore to signing tool for Git commits with your a GitHub /
  OIDC identity. gitsign may select the wrong Rekor entry to use during online verification
  when multiple entries are returned by the log. gitsign uses Rekor's search API to fetch entries
  that apply to a signature being verified. The parameters used for the search are the public
  key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than
  both. When gitsign's credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the
  same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched
  by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entry's hash matches the payload being
  verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification. Impact
  is minimal as while gitsign does not match the payload against the entry, it does ensure that
  the certificate matches. This would need to be exploited during the certificate validity window
  (10 minutes) by the key holder.
