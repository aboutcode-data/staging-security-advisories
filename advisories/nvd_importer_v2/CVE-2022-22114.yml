aliases: []
summary: In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  (XSS). The “search term" search functionality is not sufficiently sanitized while displaying
  the results of the search, which can be leveraged to inject arbitrary scripts. These scripts
  are executed in a victim’s browser when they enter the crafted URL. In the worst case, the
  victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected
  scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator,
  by an unauthenticated attacker.
