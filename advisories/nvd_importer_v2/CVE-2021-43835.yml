summary: Sulu is an open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony framework.
  In affected versions Sulu users who have access to any subset of the admin UI are able to
  elevate their privilege. Over the API it was possible for them to give themselves permissions
  to areas which they did not already had. This issue was introduced in 2.0.0-RC1 with the new
  ProfileController putAction. The versions have been patched in 2.2.18, 2.3.8 and 2.4.0. For
  users unable to upgrade the only known workaround is to apply a patch to the ProfileController
  manually.
