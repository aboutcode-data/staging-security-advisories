aliases: []
summary: capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for the capsule operator project. Affected versions
  are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability which is based on a missing check if the
  user is authenticated based on the `TokenReview` result. All the clusters running with the
  `anonymous-auth` Kubernetes API Server setting disable (set to `false`) are affected since
  it would be possible to bypass the token review mechanism, interacting with the upper Kubernetes
  API Server. This privilege escalation cannot be exploited if you're relying only on client
  certificates (SSL/TLS). This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.4.6. Users are
  advised to upgrade.
