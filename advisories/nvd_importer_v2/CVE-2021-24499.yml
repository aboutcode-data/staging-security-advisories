aliases: []
summary: The Workreap WordPress theme before 2.2.2 AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader
  and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request
  is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files
  to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated,
  allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.
