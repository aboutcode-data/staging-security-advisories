aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated administrative access vulnerability exists in the open-source HashTech
  project (https://github.com/henzljw/hashtech) 1.0 thru commit 5919decaff2681dc250e934814fc3a35f6093ee5
  (2021-07-02). Due to missing authentication checks on /admin_index.php, an attacker can directly
  access the admin dashboard without valid credentials. This allows full administrative control
  including viewing/modifying user accounts, managing orders, changing payments, and editing
  product listings. Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure, data manipulation,
  and privilege escalation.
