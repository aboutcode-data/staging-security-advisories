aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server is an open source personal cloud solution. The audit log is used to
  get a full trail of the actions which has been incompletely populated. In affected versions
  federated share events were not properly logged which would allow brute force attacks to go
  unnoticed. This behavior exacerbates the impact of CVE-2022-31118. It is recommended that
  the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.7, 23.0.4 or 24.0.0. There are no workarounds available.
