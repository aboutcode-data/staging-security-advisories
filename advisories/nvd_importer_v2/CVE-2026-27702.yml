aliases: []
summary: 'Budibase is a low code platform for creating internal tools, workflows, and admin
  panels. Prior to version 3.30.4, an unsafe `eval()` vulnerability in Budibase''s view filtering
  implementation allows any authenticated user (including free tier accounts) to execute arbitrary
  JavaScript code on the server. This vulnerability ONLY affects Budibase Cloud (SaaS) - self-hosted
  deployments use native CouchDB views and are not vulnerable. The vulnerability exists in `packages/server/src/db/inMemoryView.ts`
  where user-controlled view map functions are directly evaluated without sanitization. The
  primary impact comes from what lives inside the pod''s environment: the `app-service` pod
  runs with secrets baked into its environment variables, including `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`,
  CouchDB admin credentials, AWS keys, and more. Using the extracted CouchDB credentials, we
  verified direct database access, enumerated all tenant databases, and confirmed that user
  records (email addresses) are readable. Version 3.30.4 contains a patch.'
