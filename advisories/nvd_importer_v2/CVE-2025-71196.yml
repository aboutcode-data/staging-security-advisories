summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  phy: stm32-usphyc: Fix off by one in probe()

  The "index" variable is used as an index into the usbphyc->phys[] array
  which has usbphyc->nphys elements.  So if it is equal to usbphyc->nphys
  then it is one element out of bounds.  The "index" comes from the
  device tree so it's data that we trust and it's unlikely to be wrong,
  however it's obviously still worth fixing the bug.  Change the > to >=.
