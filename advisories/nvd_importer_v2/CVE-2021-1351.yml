aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based
  interface of the affected service. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
  user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected service. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the
  context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
