aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DNA Spaces Connector
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the
  web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
  HTTP requests to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underling operating system with privileges of
  the web-based management application, which is running as a restricted user. This could result
  in changes being made to pages served by the web-based management application impacting the
  integrity or availability of the web-based management application.
