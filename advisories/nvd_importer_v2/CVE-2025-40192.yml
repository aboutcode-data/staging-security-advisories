aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Revert "ipmi: fix msg stack when IPMI is disconnected"

  This reverts commit c608966f3f9c2dca596967501d00753282b395fc.

  This patch has a subtle bug that can cause the IPMI driver to go into an
  infinite loop if the BMC misbehaves in a certain way.  Apparently
  certain BMCs do misbehave this way because several reports have come in
  recently about this.
