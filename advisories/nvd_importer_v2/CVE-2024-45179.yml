aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401 and 6.00PL01.
  Due to insufficient input validation, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to OS command
  injection attacks. It was found out that different functionality is vulnerable to OS command
  injection attacks, for example for generating new X.509 certificates, or setting the time
  zone. These OS command injection vulnerabilities in the script generatesslreq.pml can be exploited
  as a low-privileged authenticated user to execute commands in the context of the Linux user
  www-data via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data (e.g., the city parameter). The OS command
  injection vulnerability in the script settimezone.pml or setdatetime.pml (e.g., via the year
  parameter) requires an administrative user for the C-MOR web interface. By also exploiting
  a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands on the C-MOR system
  with root privileges.
