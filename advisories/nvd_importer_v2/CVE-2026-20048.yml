summary: "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco\
  \ Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is due to improper processing when parsing SNMP requests. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by continuously sending SNMP queries&nbsp;to a specific MIB of an affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a kernel panic on the device,\
  \ resulting in a reload and a&nbsp;DoS condition.\r\nNote: This vulnerability affects SNMP\
  \ versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit&nbsp;this vulnerability through SNMPv1 or&nbsp;SNMPv2c,\
  \ the attacker must have a valid read-only SNMP community string for the affected system.\
  \ To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv3, the attacker must have valid SNMP user credentials\
  \ for the affected system."
