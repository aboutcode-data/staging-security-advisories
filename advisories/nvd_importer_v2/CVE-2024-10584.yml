aliases: []
summary: The DirectoryPress – Business Directory And Classified Ad Listing plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and
  including, 3.6.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. When DirectoryPress
  Frontend is installed, this can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
