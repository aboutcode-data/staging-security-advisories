summary: Kafka Connect BigQuery Connector is an implementation of a sink connector from Apache
  Kafka to Google BigQuery. Prior to 2.11.0, there is an arbitrary file read in Google BigQuery
  Sink connector. Aiven's Google BigQuery Kafka Connect Sink connector requires Google Cloud
  credential configurations for authentication to BigQuery services. During connector configuration,
  users can supply credential JSON files that are processed by Google authentication libraries.
  The service fails to validate externally-sourced credential configurations before passing
  them to the authentication libraries. An attacker can exploit this by providing a malicious
  credential configuration containing crafted credential_source.file paths or credential_source.url
  endpoints, resulting in arbitrary file reads or SSRF attacks.
