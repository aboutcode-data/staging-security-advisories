aliases: []
summary: Picotls is a TLS protocol library that allows users select different crypto backends
  based on their use case. When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically,
  bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory
  twice. This double free occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening
  calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and
  abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being
  used, the flaw could potentially lead to a use-after-free scenario, which might allow for
  arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed with commit 9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d.
