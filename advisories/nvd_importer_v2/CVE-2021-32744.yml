aliases: []
summary: Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite. In versions prior to 4.2.17-1
  and version 6.4.9-5, unauthenticated attackers are able to gain access to files which are
  currently opened by other users in the Collabora Online editor. For successful exploitation
  the attacker is required to guess the file identifier - the predictability of this file identifier
  is dependent on external file-storage implementations (this is a potential "IDOR" - Insecure
  Direct Object Reference - vulnerability). Versions 4.2.17-1 and 6.4.9-5 contain patches for
  this issue. There is no known workaround except updating the Collabora Online application
  to one of the patched releases.
