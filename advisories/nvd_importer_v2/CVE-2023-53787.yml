summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  regulator: da9063: fix null pointer deref with partial DT config

  When some of the da9063 regulators do not have corresponding DT nodes
  a null pointer dereference occurs on boot because such regulators have
  no init_data causing the pointers calculated in
  da9063_check_xvp_constraints() to be invalid.

  Do not dereference them in this case.
