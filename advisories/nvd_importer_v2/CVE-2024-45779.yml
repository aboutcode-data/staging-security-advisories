aliases: []
summary: An integer overflow flaw was found in the BFS file system driver in grub2. When reading
  a file with an indirect extent map, grub2 fails to validate the number of extent entries to
  be read. A crafted or corrupted BFS filesystem may cause an integer overflow during the file
  reading, leading to a heap of bounds read. As a consequence, sensitive data may be leaked,
  or grub2 will crash.
