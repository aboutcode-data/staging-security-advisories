aliases: []
summary: The Automotive Car Dealership Business WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Call to Action' custom fields in all versions up to,
  and including, 13.4. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user-supplied attributes in the 'action_text', 'action_button_text', 'action_link', and 'action_class'
  custom fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever
  a user accesses an injected page.
