aliases: []
summary: The SureMail – SMTP and Email Logs Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unrestricted
  Upload of File with Dangerous Type in versions up to and including 1.9.0. This is due to the
  plugin's save_file() function in inc/emails/handler/uploads.php which duplicates all email
  attachments to a web-accessible directory (wp-content/uploads/suremails/attachments/) without
  validating file extensions or content types. Files are saved with predictable names derived
  from MD5 hashes of their content. While the plugin attempts to protect this directory with
  an Apache .htaccess file to disable PHP execution, this protection is ineffective on nginx,
  IIS, and Lighttpd servers, or on misconfigured Apache installations. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to achieve Remote Code Execution by uploading malicious PHP
  files through any public form that emails attachments, calculating the predictable filename,
  and directly accessing the file to execute arbitrary code granted they are exploiting a site
  running on an affected web server configuration.
