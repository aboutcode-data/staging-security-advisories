aliases: []
summary: The qnotsquiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the 'qnotsquiz_custom_start_text' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
  and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
