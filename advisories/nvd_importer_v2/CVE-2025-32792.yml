aliases: []
summary: SES safely executes third-party JavaScript 'strict' mode programs in compartments that
  have no excess authority in their global scope. Prior to version 1.12.0, web pages and web
  extensions using `ses` and the Compartment API to evaluate third-party code in an isolated
  execution environment that have also elsewhere used `const`, `let`, and `class` bindings in
  the top-level scope of a `<script>` tag will have inadvertently revealed these bindings in
  the lexical scope of third-party code. This issue has been patched in version 1.12.0. Workarounds
  for this issue involve either avoiding top-level `let`, `const`, or `class` bindings in `<script>`
  tags, or change these to `var` bindings to be reflected on `globalThis`.
