aliases: []
summary: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that
  can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session
  token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user
  has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during
  user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4
  removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())`
  in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.
