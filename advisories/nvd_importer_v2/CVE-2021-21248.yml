aliases: []
summary: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a
  critical vulnerability involving the build endpoint parameters. InputSpec is used to define
  parameters of a Build spec. It does so by using dynamically generated Groovy classes. A user
  able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary
  Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the injection of a static constructor that will run
  arbitrary code. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed
  in 4.0.3 by escaping special characters such as quote from user input.
