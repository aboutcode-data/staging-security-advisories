aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the
  Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically within the DonutProcessor class's `token2json()`
  method. This vulnerability affects versions 4.50.3 and earlier, and is fixed in version 4.52.1.
  The issue arises from the regex pattern `<s_(.*?)>` which can be exploited to cause excessive
  CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability
  can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities,
  impacting document processing tasks using the Donut model.
