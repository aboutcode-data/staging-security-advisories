summary: "A vulnerability with the Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Layer 2 ingress packet processing of\
  \ Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches and Cisco Nexus 9500-R Series Switching Platforms could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a Layer 2 traffic loop.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to a logic error when processing a crafted Layer 2 ingress frame. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted Ethernet frames\
  \ through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a Layer\
  \ 2 Virtual eXtensible LAN (VxLAN) traffic loop, which, in turn, could result in a denial\
  \ of service (DoS) condition. This Layer 2 loop could oversubscribe the bandwidth on network\
  \ interfaces, which would result in all data plane traffic being dropped. To exploit this\
  \ vulnerability, the attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device.\r\nNote:&nbsp;To\
  \ stop active exploitation of this vulnerability, manual intervention is required to both\
  \ stop the crafted traffic and flap all involved network interfaces. For additional assistance\
  \ if a Layer 2 loop that is related to this vulnerability is suspected, contact the Cisco\
  \ Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or the proper support provider.&nbsp;"
