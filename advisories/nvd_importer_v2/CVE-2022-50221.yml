  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/fb-helper: Fix out-of-bounds access

  Clip memory range to screen-buffer size to avoid out-of-bounds access
  in fbdev deferred I/O's damage handling.

  Fbdev's deferred I/O can only track pages. From the range of pages, the
  damage handler computes the clipping rectangle for the display update.
  If the fbdev screen buffer ends near the beginning of a page, that page
  could contain more scanlines. The damage handler would then track these
  non-existing scanlines as dirty and provoke an out-of-bounds access
  during the screen update. Hence, clip the maximum memory range to the
  size of the screen buffer.

  While at it, rename the variables min/max to min_off/max_off in
  drm_fb_helper_deferred_io(). This avoids confusion with the macros of
  the same name.
