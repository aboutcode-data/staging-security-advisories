aliases: []
summary: 'Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3 allows the upload of entire-site
  configuration archives through the user interface or command line. It does not sufficiently
  check uploaded archives for invalid data, potentially allowing non-configuration scripts to
  be uploaded to the server. (This attack is mitigated by the attacker needing the "Synchronize,
  import, and export configuration" permission, a permission that only trusted administrators
  should be given. Other preventative measures in Backdrop CMS prevent the execution of PHP
  scripts, so another server-side scripting language must be accessible on the server to execute
  code.) Note: This has been disputed by multiple 3rd parties due to advanced permissions that
  are needed to exploit.'
