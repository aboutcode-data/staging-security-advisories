aliases: []
summary: The Alex User Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  alex_user_counter_function() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update the plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
