aliases: []
summary: TruffleHog is a secrets scanning tool. Prior to v3.81.9, this vulnerability allows
  a malicious actor to craft data in a way that, when scanned by specific detectors, could trigger
  the detector to make an unauthorized request to an endpoint chosen by the attacker. For an
  exploit to be effective, the target endpoint must be an unauthenticated GET endpoint that
  produces side effects. The victim must scan the maliciously crafted data and have such an
  endpoint targeted for the exploit to succeed. The vulnerability has been resolved in TruffleHog
  v3.81.9 and later versions.
