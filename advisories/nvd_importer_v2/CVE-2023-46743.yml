aliases: []
summary: application-collabora is an integration of Collabora Online in XWiki. As part of the
  application use cases, depending on the rights that a user has over a document, they should
  be able to open the office attachments files in view or edit mode. Currently, if a user opens
  an attachment file in edit mode in collabora, this right will be preserved for all future
  users, until the editing session is closes, even if some of them have only view right. Collabora
  server is the one issuing this request and it seems that the `userCanWrite` query parameter
  is cached, even if, for example, token is not. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.
