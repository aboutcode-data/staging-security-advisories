summary: OpenLIT is an open source platform for AI engineering. Prior to version 1.37.1, several
  GitHub Actions workflows in OpenLIT's GitHub repository use the `pull_request_target` event
  while checking out and executing untrusted code from forked pull requests. These workflows
  run with the security context of the base repository, including a write-privileged `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  and numerous sensitive secrets (API keys, database/vector store tokens, and a Google Cloud
  service account key). Version 1.37.1 contains a fix.
