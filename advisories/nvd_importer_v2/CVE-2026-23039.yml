  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/gud: fix NULL fb and crtc dereferences on USB disconnect

  On disconnect drm_atomic_helper_disable_all() is called which
  sets both the fb and crtc for a plane to NULL before invoking a commit.

  This causes a kernel oops on every display disconnect.

  Add guards for those dereferences.
