summary: 'OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive
  data including secrets, certificates, and keys. In versions 2.3.1 and below, OpenBao''s Login
  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system allows enforcing MFA using Time-based One Time Password
  (TOTP). Due to normalization applied by the underlying TOTP library, codes were accepted which
  could contain whitespace; this whitespace could bypass internal rate limiting of the MFA method
  and allow reuse of existing MFA codes. This issue was fixed in version 2.3.2. To work around
  this, use of rate-limiting quotas can limit an attacker''s ability to exploit this: https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/.'
