  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: typec: ucsi: Retrieve all the PDOs instead of just the first 4

  commit 4dbc6a4ef06d ("usb: typec: ucsi: save power data objects
  in PD mode") introduced retrieval of the PDOs when connected to a
  PD-capable source. But only the first 4 PDOs are received since
  that is the maximum number that can be fetched at a time given the
  MESSAGE_IN length limitation (16 bytes). However, as per the PD spec
  a connected source may advertise up to a maximum of 7 PDOs.

  If such a source is connected it's possible the PPM could have
  negotiated a power contract with one of the PDOs at index greater
  than 4, and would be reflected in the request data object's (RDO)
  object position field. This would result in an out-of-bounds access
  when the rdo_index() is used to index into the src_pdos array in
  ucsi_psy_get_voltage_now().

  With the help of the UBSAN -fsanitize=array-bounds checker enabled
  this exact issue is revealed when connecting to a PD source adapter
  that advertise 5 PDOs and the PPM enters a contract having selected
  the 5th one.

  We can resolve this by instead retrieving and storing up to the
  maximum of 7 PDOs in the con->src_pdos array. This would involve
  two calls to the GET_PDOS command.
