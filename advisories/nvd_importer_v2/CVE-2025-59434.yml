aliases: []
summary: Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model
  flow. Prior to August 2025 Cloud-Hosted Flowise, an authenticated vulnerability in Flowise
  Cloud allows any user on the free tier to access sensitive environment variables from other
  tenants via the Custom JavaScript Function node. This includes secrets such as OpenAI API
  keys, AWS credentials, Supabase tokens, and Google Cloud secrets — resulting in a full cross-tenant
  data exposure. This issue has been patched in the August 2025 Cloud-Hosted Flowise.
