aliases: []
summary: "All versions of the package check-branches are vulnerable to Command Injection check-branches\
  \ is a command-line tool that is interacted with locally, or via CI, to confirm no conflicts\
  \ exist in git branches.\r\rHowever, the library follows these conventions which can be abused:\r\
  1. It trusts branch names as they are (plain text)\r2. It spawns git commands by concatenating\
  \ user input\r\rSince a branch name is potentially a user input - as users can create branches\
  \ remotely via pull requests, or simply due to privileged access to a repository - it can\
  \ effectively be abused to run any command."
