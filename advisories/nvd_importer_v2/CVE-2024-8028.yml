summary: A vulnerability in danswer-ai/danswer v0.3.94 allows an attacker to cause a Denial
  of Service (DoS) by uploading a file with a malformed multipart boundary. By appending a large
  number of characters to the end of the multipart boundary, the server continuously processes
  each character, rendering the application inaccessible. This issue can be exploited by sending
  a single crafted request, affecting all users on the server.
