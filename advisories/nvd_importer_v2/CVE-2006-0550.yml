summary: 'Buffer overflow in an unspecified Oracle Client utility might allow remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.  NOTE: due to the lack of relevant
  details from the Oracle advisory, a separate CVE is being created since it cannot be conclusively
  proven that this issue has been addressed by Oracle.  It is possible that this is the same
  issue as Oracle Vuln# DBC02 from the January 2006 CPU, in which case this would be a duplicate
  of CVE-2006-0283.  However, there are enough inconsistencies that the mapping can not be made
  authoritatively.'
