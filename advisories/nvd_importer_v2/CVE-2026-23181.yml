  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: sync read disk super and set block size

  When the user performs a btrfs mount, the block device is not set
  correctly. The user sets the block size of the block device to 0x4000
  by executing the BLKBSZSET command.
  Since the block size change also changes the mapping->flags value, this
  further affects the result of the mapping_min_folio_order() calculation.

  Let's analyze the following two scenarios:

  Scenario 1: Without executing the BLKBSZSET command, the block size is
  0x1000, and mapping_min_folio_order() returns 0;

  Scenario 2: After executing the BLKBSZSET command, the block size is
  0x4000, and mapping_min_folio_order() returns 2.

  do_read_cache_folio() allocates a folio before the BLKBSZSET command
  is executed. This results in the allocated folio having an order value
  of 0. Later, after BLKBSZSET is executed, the block size increases to
  0x4000, and the mapping_min_folio_order() calculation result becomes 2.

  This leads to two undesirable consequences:

  1. filemap_add_folio() triggers a VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO(folio_order(folio) <
  mapping_min_folio_order(mapping)) assertion.

  2. The syzbot report [1] shows a null pointer dereference in
  create_empty_buffers() due to a buffer head allocation failure.

  Synchronization should be established based on the inode between the
  BLKBSZSET command and read cache page to prevent inconsistencies in
  block size or mapping flags before and after folio allocation.
