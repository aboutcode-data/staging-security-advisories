aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges
  in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step,
  the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access
  to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file
  containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution
  on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their
  permissions on the node running the container.
