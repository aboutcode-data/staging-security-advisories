aliases: []
summary: The tbm-client from Chunghwa Telecom has an Arbitrary File vulnerability. The application
  sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the target website.
  Due to the lack of CSRF protection in the APIs, unauthenticated remote attackers could use
  these APIs through phishing. Additionally, one of the APIs contains an Absolute Path Traversal
  vulnerability. Attackers can copy arbitrary files on the user's system and paste them into
  any path, which poses a potential risk of information leakage or could consume hard drive
  space by copying files in large volumes.
