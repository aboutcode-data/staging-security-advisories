aliases: []
summary: The Custom Post Limits plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to full path disclosure in
  all versions up to, and including, 4.4.1. This is due to the plugin utilizing bootstrap and
  leaving test files with display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks.
  The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to
  be present for damage to an affected website.
