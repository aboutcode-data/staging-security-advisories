aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue occurs because sensitive runtime values, such
  as passwords, may be captured during the Keycloak build process and embedded as default values
  in bytecode, leading to unintended information disclosure. In Keycloak 26, sensitive data
  specified directly in environment variables during the build process is also stored as a default
  values, making it accessible during runtime. Indirect usage of environment variables for SPI
  options and Quarkus properties is also vulnerable due to unconditional expansion by PropertyMapper
  logic, capturing sensitive data as default values in all Keycloak versions up to 26.0.2.
