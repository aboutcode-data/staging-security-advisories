aliases: []
summary: 'OpenPGP.js is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. In affected versions
  OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed messages where the signed text
  is readable without special tools. These messages typically contain a "Hash: ..." header declaring
  the hash algorithm used to compute the signature digest. OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any
  data preceding the "Hash: ..." texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious
  parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim
  to believe that the arbitrary text was signed. A user or application is vulnerable to said
  attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned `verified`
  property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead _visually trusting_ the
  contents of the original message. Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the
  actual signed data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable. Similarly,
  given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using `getText()` or the `text` field
  returns only the contents that are considered when verifying the signature. Finally, re-armoring
  a CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a "sanitised" version, with
  the extraneous text being removed. This issue has been addressed in version 5.10.1 (current
  stable version) which will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()` and
  in version 4.10.11 (legacy version) which will will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check the contents of `verificationResult.data`
  to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually trusting the contents of the armored
  message.'
