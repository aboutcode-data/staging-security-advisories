  ipv6: Fix ECMP sibling count mismatch when clearing RTF_ADDRCONF

  syzbot reported a kernel BUG in fib6_add_rt2node() when adding an IPv6
  route. [0]

  Commit f72514b3c569 ("ipv6: clear RA flags when adding a static
  route") introduced logic to clear RTF_ADDRCONF from existing routes
  when a static route with the same nexthop is added. However, this
  causes a problem when the existing route has a gateway.

  When RTF_ADDRCONF is cleared from a route that has a gateway, that
  route becomes eligible for ECMP, i.e. rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() returns
  true. The issue is that this route was never added to the
  fib6_siblings list.

  This leads to a mismatch between the following counts:

  - The sibling count computed by iterating fib6_next chain, which
    includes the newly ECMP-eligible route

  - The actual siblings in fib6_siblings list, which does not include
    that route

  When a subsequent ECMP route is added, fib6_add_rt2node() hits
  BUG_ON(sibling->fib6_nsiblings != rt->fib6_nsiblings) because the
  counts don't match.

  Fix this by only clearing RTF_ADDRCONF when the existing route does
  not have a gateway. Routes without a gateway cannot qualify for ECMP
  anyway (rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() requires fib_nh_gw_family), so clearing
  RTF_ADDRCONF on them is safe and matches the original intent of the
  commit.
