aliases: []
summary: Lightdash version 0.1024.6 allows users with the necessary permissions, such as Administrator
  or Editor, to create and share dashboards. A dashboard that contains HTML elements which point
  to a threat actor controlled source can trigger an SSRF request when exported, via a POST
  request to /api/v1/dashboards//export. The forged request contains the value of the exporting
  user’s session token. A threat actor could obtain the session token of any user who exports
  the dashboard. The obtained session token can be used to perform actions as the victim on
  the application, resulting in session takeover.
