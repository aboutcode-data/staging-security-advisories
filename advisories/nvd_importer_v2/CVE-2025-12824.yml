aliases: []
summary: The Player Leaderboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 via the 'player_leaderboard' shortcode. This is due
  to the plugin using an unsanitized user-supplied value from the shortcode's 'mode' attribute
  in a call to include() without proper path validation. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files
  on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to
  bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve full remote code execution if combined
  with file upload capabilities.
