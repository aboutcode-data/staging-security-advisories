aliases: []
summary: The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce plugin, in all versions starting at 1.0.8 up
  until 1.3.2, contains a vulnerability due to improper nonce verification in its settings reset
  functionality. The issue exists in the settings_init() function, which processes a reset action
  based on specific query parameters in the URL. The related delete_settings() function performs
  a faulty nonce validation check, making the reset operation insecure and susceptible to unauthorized
  access.
