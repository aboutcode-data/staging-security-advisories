aliases: []
summary: Known is a social publishing platform. Prior to 1.6.3, a Critical Broken Authentication
  vulnerability exists in Known 1.6.2 and earlier. The application leaks the password reset
  token within a hidden HTML input field on the password reset page. This allows any unauthenticated
  attacker to retrieve the reset token for any user by simply querying the user's email, leading
  to full Account Takeover (ATO) without requiring access to the victim's email inbox. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.3.
