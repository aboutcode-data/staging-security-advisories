summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;ECE could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to an undesired web page.\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request\
  \ that is sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading\
  \ a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause the interface to redirect the user to a specific, malicious URL. This type of vulnerability\
  \ is known as an open redirect and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly\
  \ visit malicious sites.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability.\
  \ There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
