summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sysv: don't call sb_bread() with pointers_lock held

  syzbot is reporting sleep in atomic context in SysV filesystem [1], for
  sb_bread() is called with rw_spinlock held.

  A "write_lock(&pointers_lock) => read_lock(&pointers_lock) deadlock" bug
  and a "sb_bread() with write_lock(&pointers_lock)" bug were introduced by
  "Replace BKL for chain locking with sysvfs-private rwlock" in Linux 2.5.12.

  Then, "[PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix" in Linux 2.6.8 fixed the
  former bug by moving pointers_lock lock to the callers, but instead
  introduced a "sb_bread() with read_lock(&pointers_lock)" bug (which made
  this problem easier to hit).

  Al Viro suggested that why not to do like get_branch()/get_block()/
  find_shared() in Minix filesystem does. And doing like that is almost a
  revert of "[PATCH] err1-40: sysvfs locking fix" except that get_branch()
   from with find_shared() is called without write_lock(&pointers_lock).
