summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/panthor: Flush shmem writes before mapping buffers CPU-uncached

  The shmem layer zeroes out the new pages using cached mappings, and if
  we don't CPU-flush we might leave dirty cachelines behind, leading to
  potential data leaks and/or asynchronous buffer corruption when dirty
  cachelines are evicted.
