summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak

  In gs_can_open(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to the
  parent->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the complete callback
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(), the URB is processed and resubmitted. In
  gs_can_close() the URBs are freed by calling
  usb_kill_anchored_urbs(parent->rx_submitted).

  However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
  the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
  in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
  released in gs_can_close().

  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() to the parent->rx_submitted anchor.
