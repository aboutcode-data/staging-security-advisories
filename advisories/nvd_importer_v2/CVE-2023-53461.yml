summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring: wait interruptibly for request completions on exit

  WHen the ring exits, cleanup is done and the final cancelation and
  waiting on completions is done by io_ring_exit_work. That function is
  invoked by kworker, which doesn't take any signals. Because of that, it
  doesn't really matter if we wait for completions in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
  or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state. However, it does matter to the hung task
  detection checker!

  Normally we expect cancelations and completions to happen rather
  quickly. Some test cases, however, will exit the ring and park the
  owning task stopped (eg via SIGSTOP). If the owning task needs to run
  task_work to complete requests, then io_ring_exit_work won't make any
  progress until the task is runnable again. Hence io_ring_exit_work can
  trigger the hung task detection, which is particularly problematic if
  panic-on-hung-task is enabled.

  As the ring exit doesn't take signals to begin with, have it wait
  interruptibly rather than uninterruptibly. io_uring has a separate
  stuck-exit warning that triggers independently anyway, so we're not
  really missing anything by making this switch.
