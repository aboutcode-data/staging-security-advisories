aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The
  password reset mechanism of the Directus backend allows attackers to receive a password reset
  email of a victim user, specifically having it arrive at a similar email address as the victim
  with a one or more characters changed to use accents. This is due to the fact that by default
  MySQL/MariaDB are configured for accent-insensitive and case-insensitive comparisons. This
  vulnerability is fixed in version 10.8.3.
