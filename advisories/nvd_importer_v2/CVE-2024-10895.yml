summary: The Counter Up – Animated Number Counter & Milestone Showcase plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'lgx-counter' shortcode in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.4.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
