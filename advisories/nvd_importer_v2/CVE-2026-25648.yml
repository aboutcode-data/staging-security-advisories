aliases: []
summary: Versions of the Traccar open-source GPS tracking system starting with 6.11.1 contain
  an issue in which authenticated users can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other
  users' browsers by uploading malicious SVG files as device images. The application accepts
  SVG file uploads without sanitization and serves them with the `image/svg+xml` Content-Type,
  allowing embedded JavaScript to execute when victims view the image. As of time of publication,
  it is unclear whether a fix is available.
