aliases: []
summary: The Database Backup and check Tables Automated With Scheduler 2024 plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'database_backup_ajax_delete'
  function in all versions up to, and including, 2.35. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,
  which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
  The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.36.
