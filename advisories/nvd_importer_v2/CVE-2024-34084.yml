aliases: []
summary: Minder's `HandleGithubWebhook` is susceptible to a denial of service attack from an
  untrusted HTTP request. The vulnerability exists before the request has been validated, and
  as such the request is still untrusted at the point of failure. This allows an attacker with
  the ability to send requests to `HandleGithubWebhook` to crash the Minder controlplane and
  deny other users from using it. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.48.
