  arm64: mm: Fix lockless walks with static and dynamic page-table folding

  Lina reports random oopsen originating from the fast GUP code when
  16K pages are used with 4-level page-tables, the fourth level being
  folded at runtime due to lack of LPA2.

  In this configuration, the generic implementation of
  p4d_offset_lockless() will return a 'p4d_t *' corresponding to the
  'pgd_t' allocated on the stack of the caller, gup_fast_pgd_range().
  This is normally fine, but when the fourth level of page-table is folded
  at runtime, pud_offset_lockless() will offset from the address of the
  'p4d_t' to calculate the address of the PUD in the same page-table page.
  This results in a stray stack read when the 'p4d_t' has been allocated
  on the stack and can send the walker into the weeds.

  Fix the problem by providing our own definition of p4d_offset_lockless()
  when CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 4 which returns the real page-table
  pointer rather than the address of the local stack variable.
