aliases: []
summary: Conform, a type-safe form validation library, allows the parsing of nested objects
  in the form of `object.property`. Due to an improper implementation of this feature in versions
  prior to 1.1.1, an attacker can exploit the feature to trigger prototype pollution by passing
  a crafted input to `parseWith...` functions. Applications that use conform for server-side
  validation of form data or URL parameters are affected by this vulnerability. Version 1.1.1
  contains a patch for the issue.
