aliases: []
summary: The H2O machine learning platform uses "Iced" classes as the primary means of moving
  Java Objects around the cluster. The Iced format supports inclusion of serialized Java objects.
  When a model is deserialized, any class is allowed to be deserialized (no class whitelist).
  An attacker can construct a crafted Iced model that uses Java gadgets and leads to arbitrary
  code execution when imported to the H2O platform.
