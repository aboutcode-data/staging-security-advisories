aliases: []
summary: The Bot for Telegram on WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive
  information disclosure due to missing authorization checks on the 'stm_wpcfto_get_settings'
  AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to view the Telegram Bot Token, a secret
  token used to control the bot, which can then be used to log in as any existing user on the
  site, such as an administrator, if they know the username, due to the Login with Telegram
  feature.
