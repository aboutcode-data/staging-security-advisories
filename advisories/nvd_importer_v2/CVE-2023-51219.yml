aliases: []
summary: A deep link validation issue in KakaoTalk 10.4.3 allowed a remote adversary to direct
  users to run any attacker-controlled JavaScript within a WebView. The impact was further escalated
  by triggering another WebView that leaked its access token in a HTTP request header. Ultimately,
  this access token could be used to take over another user's account and read her/his chat
  messages.
