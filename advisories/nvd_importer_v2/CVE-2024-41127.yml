aliases: []
summary: Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. Monkeytype is vulnerable
  to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub
  Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml
  workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download
  an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt
  artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated
  that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing
  an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0.
