aliases: []
summary: Hickory DNS is a Rust based DNS client, server, and resolver. A vulnerability present
  starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5 impacts Hickory
  DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive
  resolver. The DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted
  once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes
  a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will
  be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability
  involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust
  in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone. Versions 0.24.3 and 0.25.0-alpha.5
  fix the issue.
