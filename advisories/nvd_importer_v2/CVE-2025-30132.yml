aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam V devices. It uses an unregistered public
  domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. During analysis, it was found
  that this domain was not owned by IROAD, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially
  intercept sensitive device traffic. If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve
  this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration
  or man-in-the-middle attacks.
