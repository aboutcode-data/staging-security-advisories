  net: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass

  syzbot reported[1] a use-after-free when deleting an expired fdb. It is
  due to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being
  deleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been
  toggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we
  have MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN
  filtering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't
  happen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled
  because we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop
  learning. This fix adds a check for the port's vlan group which is
  initialized to NULL when the port is getting deleted, that avoids the port
  state bypass. When MST is enabled there would be a minimal new overhead
  in the fast-path because the port's vlan group pointer is cache-hot.
