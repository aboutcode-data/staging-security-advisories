summary: mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to a relative path traversal attack, allowing
  unauthorized attackers with a default role account to delete files and folders within the

  stems from insufficient input validation and normalization in the handling of file and folder
  deletion requests. Successful exploitation results in the compromise of data integrity and
