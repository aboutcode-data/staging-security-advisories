aliases: []
summary: '@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem.
  Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for user authentication, in combination
  with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are vulnerable to
  session fixation attacks from network and same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on
  the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are
  performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is
  preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers
  can hijack the victim''s session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim''s browser
  and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport`
  regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from
  being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.'
