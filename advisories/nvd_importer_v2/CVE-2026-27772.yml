aliases: []
summary: "WebSocket endpoints lack proper authentication mechanisms, enabling \nattackers to\
  \ perform unauthorized station impersonation and manipulate \ndata sent to the backend. An\
  \ unauthenticated attacker can connect to the\n OCPP WebSocket endpoint using a known or discovered\
  \ charging station \nidentifier, then issue or receive OCPP commands as a legitimate charger.\n\
  \ Given that no authentication is required, this can lead to privilege \nescalation, unauthorized\
  \ control of charging infrastructure, and \ncorruption of charging network data reported to\
  \ the backend."
