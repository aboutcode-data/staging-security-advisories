aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) additional paths feature of Cisco
  IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent authorized users
  from monitoring the BGP status and cause the BGP process to stop processing new updates, resulting
  in a denial of service (DOS) condition. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect calculation
  of lexicographical order when displaying additional path information within Cisco IOS XR Software,
  which causes an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific
  BGP update from a BGP neighbor peer session of an affected device; an authorized user must
  then issue a show bgp command for the vulnerability to be exploited. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to prevent authorized users from properly monitoring the BGP status
  and prevent BGP from processing new updates, resulting in outdated information in the routing
  and forwarding tables.
