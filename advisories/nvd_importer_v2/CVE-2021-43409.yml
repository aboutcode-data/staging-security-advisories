aliases: []
summary: The “WPO365 | LOGIN” WordPress plugin (up to and including version 15.3) by wpo365.com
  is vulnerable to a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (also known as Stored
  or Second-Order XSS). Persistent XSS vulnerabilities occur when the application stores and
  retrieves client supplied data without proper handling of dangerous content. This type of
  XSS vulnerability is exploited by submitting malicious script content to the application which
  is then retrieved and executed by other application users. The attacker could exploit this
  to conduct a range of attacks against users of the affected application such as session hijacking,
  account take over and accessing sensitive data. In this case, the XSS payload can be submitted
  by any anonymous user, the payload then renders and executes when a WordPress administrator
  authenticates and accesses the WordPress Dashboard. The injected payload can carry out actions
  on behalf of the administrator including adding other administrative users and changing application
  settings. This flaw could be exploited to ultimately provide full control of the affected
  system to the attacker.
