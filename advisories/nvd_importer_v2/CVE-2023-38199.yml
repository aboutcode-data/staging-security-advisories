aliases: []
summary: coreruleset (aka OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set) through 3.3.4 does not detect multiple
  Content-Type request headers on some platforms. This might allow attackers to bypass a WAF
  with a crafted payload, aka "Content-Type confusion" between the WAF and the backend application.
  This occurs when the web application relies on only the last Content-Type header. Other platforms
  may reject the additional Content-Type header or merge conflicting headers, leading to detection
  as a malformed header.
