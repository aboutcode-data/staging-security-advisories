summary: TS3 Manager is modern web interface for maintaining Teamspeak3 servers. A Denial of
  Dervice vulnerability has been identified in versions 2.2.1 and earlier. The vulnerability
  permits an unauthenticated actor to crash the application through the submission of specially
  crafted Unicode input, requiring no prior authentication or privileges. The flaw manifests
  when Unicode tag characters are submitted to the Server field on the login page. The application
  fails to properly handle these characters during the ASCII conversion process, resulting in
  an unhandled exception that terminates the application within four to five seconds of submission.
  This issue is fixed in version 2.2.2.
