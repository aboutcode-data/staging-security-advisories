aliases: []
summary: BlockHosts before 2.0.4 does not properly parse (1) sshd and (2) vsftpd log files,
  which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary deny entries to the /etc/hosts.allow file and
  cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to a daemon log file, as demonstrated
  by connecting through ssh with a client protocol version identification containing an IP address
  string, or connecting through ftp with a username containing an IP address string, different
  vectors than CVE-2007-2765.
