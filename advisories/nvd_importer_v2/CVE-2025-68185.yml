summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfs4_setup_readdir(): insufficient locking for ->d_parent->d_inode dereferencing

  Theoretically it's an oopsable race, but I don't believe one can manage
  to hit it on real hardware; might become doable on a KVM, but it still
  won't be easy to attack.

  Anyway, it's easy to deal with - since xdr_encode_hyper() is just a call of
  put_unaligned_be64(), we can put that under ->d_lock and be done with that.
