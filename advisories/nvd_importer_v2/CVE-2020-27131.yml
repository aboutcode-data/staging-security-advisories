aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java deserialization function that is used by Cisco
  Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands
  on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied
  content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
  a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with the privileges
  of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on the Windows target host. Cisco has not released software updates
  that address these vulnerabilities.
