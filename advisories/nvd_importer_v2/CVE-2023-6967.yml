aliases: []
summary: The Pods – Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL
  Injection via shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.10 (with the exception of
  2.7.31.2, 2.8.23.2, 2.9.19.2) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter
  and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with contributor level access or higher, to append additional SQL
  queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from
  the database.
