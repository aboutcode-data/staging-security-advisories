aliases: []
summary: There are several memory leaks in the MIFF coder in /coders/miff.c due to improper
  image depth values, which can be triggered by a specially crafted input file. These leaks
  could potentially lead to an impact to application availability or cause a denial of service.
  It was originally reported that the issues were in `AcquireMagickMemory()` because that is
  where LeakSanitizer detected the leaks, but the patch resolves issues in the MIFF coder, which
  incorrectly handles data being passed to `AcquireMagickMemory()`. This flaw affects ImageMagick
  versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
