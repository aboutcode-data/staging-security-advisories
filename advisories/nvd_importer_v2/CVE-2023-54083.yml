aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  phy: tegra: xusb: Clear the driver reference in usb-phy dev

  For the dual-role port, it will assign the phy dev to usb-phy dev and
  use the port dev driver as the dev driver of usb-phy.

  When we try to destroy the port dev, it will destroy its dev driver
  as well. But we did not remove the reference from usb-phy dev. This
  might cause the use-after-free issue in KASAN.
