aliases: []
summary: Dell EMC SupportAssist Enterprise version 1.1 creates a local Windows user account
  named "OMEAdapterUser" with a default password as part of the installation process. This unnecessary
  user account also remains even after an upgrade from v1.1 to v1.2. Access to the management
  console can be achieved by someone with knowledge of the default password. If SupportAssist
  Enterprise is installed on a server running OpenManage Essentials (OME), the OmeAdapterUser
  user account is added as a member of the OmeAdministrators group for the OME. An unauthorized
  person with knowledge of the default password and access to the OME web console could potentially
  use this account to gain access to the affected installation of OME with OmeAdministrators
  privileges. This is fixed in version 1.2.1.
