aliases: []
summary: dockerspawner is a tool to spawn JupyterHub single user servers in Docker containers.
  Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying
  `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image,
  instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been
  addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images`
  to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default
  behavior.
