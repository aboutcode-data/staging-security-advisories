summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TFlite graphs
  must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker
  could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases,
  the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls. For
  example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc)
  could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same.
  Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly
  exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
  for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
