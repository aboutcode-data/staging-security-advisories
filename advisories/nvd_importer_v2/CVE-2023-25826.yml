aliases: []
summary: Due to insufficient validation of parameters passed to the legacy HTTP query API, it
  is possible to inject crafted OS commands into multiple parameters and execute malicious code
  on the OpenTSDB host system. This exploit exists due to an incomplete fix that was made when
  this vulnerability was previously disclosed as CVE-2020-35476. Regex validation that was implemented
  to restrict allowed input to the query API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands
  to bypass validation.
