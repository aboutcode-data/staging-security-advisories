aliases: []
summary: In WinRAR versions prior to and including 5.61, there is path traversal vulnerability
  when crafting the filename field of the ACE format. The UNACE module (UNACEV2.dll) creates
  files and folders as written in the filename field even when WinRAR validator noticed the
  traversal attempt and requestd to abort the extraction process. the operation is cancelled
  only after the folders and files were created but prior to them being written, therefore allowing
  the attacker to create empty files and folders everywhere in the file system.
