  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: fix possible UAF when remounting r/o a mmp-protected file system

  After commit 618f003199c6 ("ext4: fix memory leak in
  ext4_fill_super"), after the file system is remounted read-only, there
  is a race where the kmmpd thread can exit, causing sbi->s_mmp_tsk to
  point at freed memory, which the call to ext4_stop_mmpd() can trip
  over.

  Fix this by only allowing kmmpd() to exit when it is stopped via
  ext4_stop_mmpd().
