summary: A vulnerability in the file upload functionality of Cisco Webex App for Web could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an arbitrary file to a user
  and persuading that user to browse to a specific URL. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access
  sensitive, browser-based information.
