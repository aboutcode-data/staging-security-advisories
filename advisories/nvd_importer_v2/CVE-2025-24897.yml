aliases: []
summary: Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0
  and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper
  security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of
  bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used
  for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability
  to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround,
  block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF).
