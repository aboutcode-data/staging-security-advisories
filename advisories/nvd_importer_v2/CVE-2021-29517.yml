aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. A malicious
  user could trigger a division by 0 in `Conv3D` implementation. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/42033603003965bffac51ae171b51801565e002d/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops_3d.cc#L143-L145)
  does a modulo operation based on user controlled input. Thus, when `filter` has a 0 as the
  fifth element, this results in a division by 0. Additionally, if the shape of the two tensors
  is not valid, an Eigen assertion can be triggered, resulting in a program crash. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2,
  TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still
  in supported range.
