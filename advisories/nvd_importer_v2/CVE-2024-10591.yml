aliases: []
summary: The MWB HubSpot for WooCommerce – CRM, Abandoned Cart, Email Marketing, Marketing Automation
  & Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can
  lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the hubwoo_save_updates()
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.9. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress
  site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and
  enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable
  site.
