  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64: set UXN on swapper page tables

  [ This issue was fixed upstream by accident in c3cee924bd85 ("arm64:
    head: cover entire kernel image in initial ID map") as part of a
    large refactoring of the arm64 boot flow. This simple fix is therefore
    preferred for -stable backporting ]

  On a system that implements FEAT_EPAN, read/write access to the idmap
  is denied because UXN is not set on the swapper PTEs. As a result,
  idmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings panics the kernel when accessing
  __idmap_kpti_flag. Fix it by setting UXN on these PTEs.
