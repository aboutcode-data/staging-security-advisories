  (subcomponent: Outside In Filters). The supported version that is affected is 8.5.3.0. Easily
  exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with access to the physical communication
  segment attached to the hardware where the Oracle Outside In Technology executes to compromise
  Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
  ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Outside In
  Technology. Note: Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The
  protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The
  CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside
  In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.
  CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.7 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).'
