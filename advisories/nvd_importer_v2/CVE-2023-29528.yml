aliases: []
summary: XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects.
  The "restricted" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1
  and massively improved in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code
  and thus cross-site scripting via invalid HTML comments. As a consequence, any code relying
  on this "restricted" mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection ("cross-site
  scripting"/XSS). When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki,
  the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows
  server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity
  and availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10, HTML
  comments are now removed in restricted mode and a check has been introduced that ensures that
  comments don't start with `>`. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version
  including the fix.
