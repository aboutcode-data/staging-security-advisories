aliases: []
summary: Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. Multiple Scaffolder
  actions and archive extraction utilities were vulnerable to symlink-based path traversal attacks.
  An attacker with access to create and execute Scaffolder templates could exploit symlinks
  to read arbitrary files via the `debug:log` action by creating a symlink pointing to sensitive
  files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, secrets); delete arbitrary files via the
  `fs:delete` action by creating symlinks pointing outside the workspace, and write files outside
  the workspace via archive extraction (tar/zip) containing malicious symlinks. This affects
  any Backstage deployment where users can create or execute Scaffolder templates. This vulnerability
  is fixed in `@backstage/backend-defaults` versions 0.12.2, 0.13.2, 0.14.1, and 0.15.0; `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`
  versions 2.2.2, 3.0.2, and 3.1.1; and `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` versions 0.11.2
  and 0.12.3. Users should upgrade to these versions or later. Some workarounds are available.
  Follow the recommendation in the Backstage Threat Model to limit access to creating and updating
  templates, restrict who can create and execute Scaffolder templates using the permissions
  framework, audit existing templates for symlink usage, and/or run Backstage in a containerized
  environment with limited filesystem access.
