aliases: []
summary: CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. Prior to version 3.3.1,
  CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific, sensitive keys
  used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict
  and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges.
  When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called
  the “accessKey”. To create the "accesKey", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which
  makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. An attacker could leverage
  the predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user
  to obtain higher privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation
  than to upgrade.
