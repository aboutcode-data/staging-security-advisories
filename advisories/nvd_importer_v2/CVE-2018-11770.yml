aliases: []
summary: From version 1.3.0 onward, Apache Spark's standalone master exposes a REST API for
  job submission, in addition to the submission mechanism used by spark-submit. In standalone,
  the config property 'spark.authenticate.secret' establishes a shared secret for authenticating
  requests to submit jobs via spark-submit. However, the REST API does not use this or any other
  authentication mechanism, and this is not adequately documented. In this case, a user would
  be able to run a driver program without authenticating, but not launch executors, using the
  REST API. This REST API is also used by Mesos, when set up to run in cluster mode (i.e., when
  also running MesosClusterDispatcher), for job submission. Future versions of Spark will improve
  documentation on these points, and prohibit setting 'spark.authenticate.secret' when running
  the REST APIs, to make this clear. Future versions will also disable the REST API by default
  in the standalone master by changing the default value of 'spark.master.rest.enabled' to 'false'.
