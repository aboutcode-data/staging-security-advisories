aliases: []
summary: The Nautobot Device Onboarding plugin uses the netmiko and NAPALM libraries to simplify
  the onboarding process of a new device into Nautobot down to, in many cases, an IP Address
  and a Location. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 3.0.0, credentials provided
  to onboarding task are visible via Job Results from an execution of an Onboarding Task. Version
  3.0.0 fixes this issue; no known workarounds are available. Mitigation recommendations include
  deleting all Job Results for any onboarding task to remove clear text credentials from database
  entries that were run while on v2.0.X, upgrading to v3.0.0, and rotating any exposed credentials.
