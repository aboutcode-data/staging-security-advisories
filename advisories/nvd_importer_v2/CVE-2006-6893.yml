aliases: []
summary: 'Tor allows remote attackers to discover the IP address of a hidden service by accessing
  this service at a high rate, thereby changing the server''s CPU temperature and consequently
  changing the pattern of time values visible through (1) ICMP timestamps, (2) TCP sequence
  numbers, and (3) TCP timestamps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0414. NOTE: it could
  be argued that this is a laws-of-physics vulnerability that is a fundamental design limitation
  of certain hardware implementations, so perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.'
