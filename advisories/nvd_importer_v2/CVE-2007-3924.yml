aliases: []
summary: 'Argument injection vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer, when running on systems
  with Netscape installed and certain URIs registered, allows remote attackers to conduct cross-browser
  scripting attacks and execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a -chrome argument
  to the navigatorurl URI, which are inserted into the command line that is created when invoking
  netscape.exe, a related issue to CVE-2007-3670.  NOTE: there has been debate about whether
  the issue is in Internet Explorer or Netscape. As of 20070713, it is CVE''s opinion that IE
  appears to not properly delimit the URL argument when invoking Netscape; this issue could
  arise with other protocol handlers in IE.'
