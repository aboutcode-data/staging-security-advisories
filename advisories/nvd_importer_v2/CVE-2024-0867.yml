aliases: []
summary: The Email Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Hook Injection
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8 via the check_nonce function. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to execute actions with hooks in WordPress under certain circumstances.
  The action the attacker wishes to execute needs to have a nonce check, and the nonce needs
  to be known to the attacker. Furthermore, the absence of a capability check is a requirement.
