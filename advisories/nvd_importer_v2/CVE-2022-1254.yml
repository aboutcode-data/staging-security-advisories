aliases: []
summary: A URL redirection vulnerability in Skyhigh SWG in main releases 10.x prior to 10.2.9,
  9.x prior to 9.2.20, 8.x prior to 8.2.27, and 7.x prior to 7.8.2.31, and controlled release
  11.x prior to 11.1.3 allows a remote attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website controlled
  by the attacker. This is possible because SWG incorrectly creates a HTTP redirect response
  when a user clicks a carefully constructed URL. Following the redirect response, the new request
  is still filtered by the SWG policy.
