summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK` failure by passing an empty image to `tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ea34a18dc3f5c8d80a40ccca1404f343b5d55f91/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/draw_bounding_box_op.cc#L148-L165)
  uses `CHECK_*` assertions instead of `OP_REQUIRES` to validate user controlled inputs. Whereas
  `OP_REQUIRES` allows returning an error condition back to the user, the `CHECK_*` macros result
  in a crash if the condition is false, similar to `assert`. In this case, `height` is 0 from
  the `images` input. This results in `max_box_row_clamp` being negative and the assertion being
  falsified, followed by aborting program execution. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
