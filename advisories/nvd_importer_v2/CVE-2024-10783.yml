summary: 'The MainWP Child – Securely Connects to the MainWP Dashboard to Manage Multiple Sites
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a missing authorization
  checks on the register_site function in all versions up to, and including, 5.2 when a site
  is left in an unconfigured state. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  log in as an administrator on instances where MainWP Child is not yet connected to the MainWP
  Dashboard. IMPORTANT: this only affects sites who have MainWP Child installed and have not
  yet connected to the MainWP Dashboard, and do not have the unique security ID feature enabled.
  Sites already connected to the MainWP Dashboard plugin and do not have the unique security
  ID feature enabled, are NOT affected and not required to upgrade. Please note 5.2.1 contains
  a partial patch, though we consider 5.3 to be the complete patch.'
