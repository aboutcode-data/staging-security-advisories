aliases: []
summary: Cloud Foundry BOSH Backup and Restore CLI, all versions prior to 1.5.0, does not check
  the authenticity of backup scripts in BOSH. A remote authenticated malicious user can modify
  the metadata file of a Bosh Backup and Restore job to request extra backup files from different
  jobs upon restore. The exploited hooks in this metadata script were only maintained in the
  cfcr-etcd-release, so clusters deployed with the BBR job for etcd in this release are vulnerable.
