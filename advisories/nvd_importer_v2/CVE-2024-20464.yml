summary: "A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature of Cisco IOS XE\
  \ Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation\
  \ of received IPv4 PIMv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\
  \n\r Note: This vulnerability can be exploited with either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet."
