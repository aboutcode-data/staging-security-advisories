aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based messaging service interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage
  Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass authentication and authorization
  and modify the configuration of an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker
  must be able to access an associated Cisco SD-WAN vEdge device. This vulnerability is due
  to insufficient authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  crafted HTTP requests to the web-based messaging service interface of an affected system.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated read and write access
  to the affected vManage system. With this access, the attacker could access information about
  the affected vManage system, modify the configuration of the system, or make configuration
  changes to devices that are managed by the system.
