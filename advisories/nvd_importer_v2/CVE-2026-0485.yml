aliases: []
summary: SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform allows an unauthenticated attacker to send specially
  crafted requests that could cause the Content Management Server (CMS) to crash and automatically
  restart. By repeatedly submitting these requests, the attacker could induce a persistent service
  disruption, rendering the CMS completely unavailable. Successful exploitation results in a
  high impact on availability, while confidentiality and integrity remain unaffected.
