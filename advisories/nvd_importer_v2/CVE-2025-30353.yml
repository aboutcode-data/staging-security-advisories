aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting
  in version 9.12.0 and prior to version 11.5.0, when a Flow with the "Webhook" trigger and
  the "Data of Last Operation" response body encounters a ValidationError thrown by a failed
  condition operation, the API response includes sensitive data. This includes environmental
  variables, sensitive API keys, user accountability information, and operational data. This
  issue poses a significant security risk, as any unintended exposure of this data could lead
  to potential misuse. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.
