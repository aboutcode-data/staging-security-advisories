aliases: []
summary: An untrusted search path (aka DLL Preload) vulnerability in the Cisco Network Academy
  Packet Tracer software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code
  via DLL hijacking if a local user with administrative privileges executes the installer in
  the current working directory where a crafted DLL has been placed by an attacker. The vulnerability
  is due to incomplete input validation of path and file names of a DLL file before it is loaded.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious DLL file and installing
  it in a specific system directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to the SYSTEM
  account. An attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
