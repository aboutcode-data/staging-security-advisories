aliases: []
summary: gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability
  due to insufficient validation of uploaded file types in its `/upload` endpoint. Specifically,
  the `handle_file_upload` function does not sanitize or validate the file extension or content
  type of uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions, including
  HTML files containing XSS payloads and Python files. This vulnerability, present in the latest
  version as of 20240310, could lead to stored XSS attacks and potentially result in remote
  code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.
