aliases: []
summary: Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for
  decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature
  verification on a specific transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized
  alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger
  if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no
  particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role).
  This is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID can
  spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID can change any other DID's alias, 3) The
  update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID.
