aliases: []
summary: Concrete 8.5.7 and below as well as Concrete 9.0 through 9.0.2 allow traversal in /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload
  which could result in an Arbitrary File Delete exploit. This was remediated by sanitizing
  /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload to ensure Concrete doesn’t allow traversal and by changing
  isFullChunkFilePresent to have an early false return when input doesn't match expectations.Concrete
  CMS Security team ranked this 5.8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
