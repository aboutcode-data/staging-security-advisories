aliases: []
summary: 'Variable overwrite vulnerability in interface/globals.php in OpenEMR 2.8.2 and earlier
  allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary program variables and conduct other unauthorized
  activities, such as conduct (a) remote file inclusion attacks via the srcdir parameter in
  custom/import_xml.php or (b) cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the rootdir parameter
  in interface/login/login_frame.php, via vectors associated with extract operations on the
  (1) POST and (2) GET superglobal arrays.  NOTE: this issue was originally disputed before
  the extract behavior was identified in post-disclosure analysis. Also, the original report
  identified "Open Conference Systems," but this was an error.'
