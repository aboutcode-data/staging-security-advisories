summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md/raid1,raid10: don't ignore IO flags

  If blk-wbt is enabled by default, it's found that raid write performance
  is quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks,
  due to flag REQ_IDLE is ignored. And turns out this behaviour exist since
  blk-wbt is introduced.

  Other than REQ_IDLE, other flags should not be ignored as well, for
  example REQ_META can be set for filesystems, clearing it can cause priority
  reverse problems; And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well, because
  io will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks.

  Fix those problems by keep IO flags from master bio.
