aliases: []
summary: Snyk has identified a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in all versions of
  Code Agent. The vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Code
  Agent container. Exploiting this vulnerability would require an attacker to have network access
  to the Code Agent within the deployment environment. External exploitation of this vulnerability
  is unlikely and depends on both misconfigurations of the cluster and/or chaining with another
  vulnerability. However, internal exploitation (with a cluster misconfiguration) could still
  be possible.
