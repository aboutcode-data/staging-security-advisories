aliases: []
summary: SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform allows an authenticated
  attacker to gain higher access levels than they should have by exploiting improper authorization
  checks, resulting in privilege escalation. While authorizations for import and export are
  distinguished, a single authorization is applied for both, which may contribute to these risks.
  On successful exploitation, this can result in potential security concerns. However, it has
  no impact on the integrity and availability of the application and may have only a low impact
  on data confidentiality.
