  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  habanalabs: fix UAF in export_dmabuf()

  As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
  thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
  returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
  race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
  follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
  destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
  by its ->release()), we have a UAF.

  dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
  habanalabs export_dmabuf() calls it and then proceeds to access the
  objects destroyed on close.  In particular, it grabs an extra reference to
  another struct file that will be dropped as part of ->release() for ours;
  that "will be" is actually "might have already been".

  Fix that by reserving descriptor before anything else and do fd_install()
  only when everything had been set up.  As a side benefit, we no longer
  have the failure exit with file already created, but reference to
  underlying file (as well as ->dmabuf_export_cnt, etc.) not grabbed yet;
  unlike dma_buf_fd(), fd_install() can't fail.
