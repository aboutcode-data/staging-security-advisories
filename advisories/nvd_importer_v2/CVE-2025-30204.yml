aliases: []
summary: golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Starting in version 3.2.0 and
  prior to versions 5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to
  strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face
  of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed by many period
  characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n
  stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This
  issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2.
