summary: The Homey theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.4.2. This is due to the plugin allowing users who are registering
  new accounts to set their own role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the Editor or Shop Manager role.
