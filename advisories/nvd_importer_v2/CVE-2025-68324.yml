  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  scsi: imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work

  The delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and
  scheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the
  IMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),
  the imm_struct device instance is deallocated.

  However, the delayed work might still be pending or executing
  when imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs
  when the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already
  freed imm_struct memory.

  The race condition can occur as follows:

  CPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1
                         | imm_queuecommand()
                         |   imm_queuecommand_lck()
  imm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()
    kfree(dev) //FREE    | imm_interrupt()
                         |   dev = container_of(...) //USE
                             dev-> //USE

  Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in imm_detach() to guarantee proper
  cancellation of the delayed work item before imm_struct is deallocated.
