summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Prior to
  versions 4.3.19, 4.4.13, 4.5.6, Mastodon is vulnerable to web cache poisoning via `Rails.cache.
  When AUTHORIZED_FETCH is enabled, the ActivityPub endpoints for pinned posts and featured
  hashtags have contents that depend on the account that signed the HTTP request. However, these
  contents are stored in an internal cache and reused with no regards to the signing actor.
  As a result, an empty response generated for a blocked user account may be served to requests
  from legitimate non-blocked actors, or conversely, content intended for non-blocked actors
  may be returned to blocked actors. This issue has been patched in versions 4.3.19, 4.4.13,
  4.5.6.
