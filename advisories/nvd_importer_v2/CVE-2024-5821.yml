aliases: []
summary: The vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server by confusing
  the agent with incorrect file names. When a user requests the content of a file with a misspelled
  name, the agent attempts to correct the command and inadvertently reveals the content of the
  intended file, such as /etc/passwd. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information
  and potential server compromise.
