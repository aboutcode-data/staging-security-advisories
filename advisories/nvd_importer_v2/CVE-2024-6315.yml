aliases: []
summary: The Blox Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'handleUploadFile' function in all versions up
  to, and including, 1.0.65. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
  remote code execution possible.
