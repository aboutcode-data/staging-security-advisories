aliases: []
summary: Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language
  development. When copying or archiving symlinked files, Gradle resolves them but applies the
  permissions of the symlink itself instead of the permissions of the linked file to the resulting
  file. This leads to files having too much permissions given that symlinks usually are world
  readable and writeable. While it is unlikely this results in a direct vulnerability for the
  impacted build, it may open up attack vectors depending on where build artifacts end up being
  copied to or un-archived. In versions 7.6.3, 8.4 and above, Gradle will now properly use the
  permissions of the file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of the copied or archived
  file.
