aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allowed a manager to bypass
  the `normalizePath()` function, intended to defend against path traversal attacks. This vulnerability
  enables the manager to read, delete, or overwrite the 'anythingllm.db' database file and other
  files stored in the 'storage' directory, such as internal communication keys and .env secrets.
  Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to application compromise, denial of service
  (DoS) attacks, and unauthorized admin account takeover. The issue stems from improper validation
  of user-supplied input in the process of setting a custom logo for the app, which can be manipulated
  to achieve arbitrary file read, deletion, or overwrite, and to execute a DoS attack by deleting
  critical files required for the application's operation.
