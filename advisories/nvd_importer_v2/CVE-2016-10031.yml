datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10031
aliases: []
summary: 'WampServer 3.0.6 installs two services called ''wampapache'' and ''wampmysqld'' with
  weak file permissions, running with SYSTEM privileges. This could potentially allow an authorized
  but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.
  To properly exploit this vulnerability, the local attacker must insert an executable file
  called mysqld.exe or httpd.exe and replace the original files. The next time the service starts,
  the malicious file will get executed as SYSTEM. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of
  this report, taking the position that a configuration in which "''someone'' (an attacker)
  is able to replace files on a PC" is not "the fault of WampServer.'
