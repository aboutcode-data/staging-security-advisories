summary: "A vulnerability in the Tail-f High Availability Cluster Communications (HCC) function\
  \ pack of Cisco Crosswork Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an authenticated,\
  \ local attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ exists because a user-controlled search path is used to locate executable files. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by configuring the application in a way that causes a malicious\
  \ file to be executed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ code on an affected device as the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker\
  \ would need valid credentials on an affected device."
