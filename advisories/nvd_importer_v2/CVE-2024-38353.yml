aliases: []
summary: CodiMD allows realtime collaborative markdown notes on all platforms. CodiMD before
  2.5.4 is missing authentication and access control vulnerability allowing an unauthenticated
  attacker to gain unauthorised access to image data uploaded to CodiMD. CodiMD does not require
  valid authentication to access uploaded images or to upload new image data. An attacker who
  can determine an uploaded image's URL can gain unauthorised access to uploaded image data.
  Due to the insecure random filename generation in the underlying Formidable library, an attacker
  can determine the filenames for previously uploaded images and the likelihood of this issue
  being exploited is increased. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.4.
