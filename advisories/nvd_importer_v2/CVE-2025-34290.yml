aliases: []
summary: Versa SASE Client for Windows versions released between 7.8.7 and 7.9.4 contain a local
  privilege escalation vulnerability in the audit log export functionality. The client communicates
  user-controlled file paths to a privileged service, which performs file system operations
  without impersonating the requesting user. Due to improper privilege handling and a time-of-check
  time-of-use race condition combined with symbolic link and mount point manipulation, a local
  authenticated attacker can coerce the service into deleting arbitrary directories with SYSTEM
  privileges. This can be exploited to delete protected system folders such as C:\\Config.msi
  and subsequently achieve execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM via MSI rollback techniques.
