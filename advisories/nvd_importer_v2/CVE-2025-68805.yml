  fuse: fix io-uring list corruption for terminated non-committed requests

  When a request is terminated before it has been committed, the request
  is not removed from the queue's list. This leaves a dangling list entry
  that leads to list corruption and use-after-free issues.

  Remove the request from the queue's list for terminated non-committed
  requests.
