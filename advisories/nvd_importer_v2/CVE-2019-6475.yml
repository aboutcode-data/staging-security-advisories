aliases: []
summary: Mirror zones are a BIND feature allowing recursive servers to pre-cache zone data provided
  by other servers. A mirror zone is similar to a zone of type secondary, except that its data
  is subject to DNSSEC validation before being used in answers, as if it had been looked up
  via traditional recursion, and when mirror zone data cannot be validated, BIND falls back
  to using traditional recursion instead of the mirror zone. However, an error in the validity
  checks for the incoming zone data can allow an on-path attacker to replace zone data that
  was validated with a configured trust anchor with forged data of the attacker's choosing.
  The mirror zone feature is most often used to serve a local copy of the root zone. If an attacker
  was able to insert themselves into the network path between a recursive server using a mirror
  zone and a root name server, this vulnerability could then be used to cause the recursive
  server to accept a copy of falsified root zone data. This affects BIND versions 9.14.0 up
  to 9.14.6, and 9.15.0 up to 9.15.4.
