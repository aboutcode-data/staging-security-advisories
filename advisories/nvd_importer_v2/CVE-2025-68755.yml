summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  staging: most: remove broken i2c driver

  The MOST I2C driver has been completely broken for five years without
  anyone noticing so remove the driver from staging.

  Specifically, commit 723de0f9171e ("staging: most: remove device from
  interface structure") started requiring drivers to set the interface
  device pointer before registration, but the I2C driver was never updated
  which results in a NULL pointer dereference if anyone ever tries to
  probe it.
