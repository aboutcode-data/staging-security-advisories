aliases: []
summary: The widely used component that establishes outbound TLS connections in SAP NetWeaver
  Application Server Java does not reliably match the hostname that is used for the connection
  against the wildcard hostname defined in the received certificate of remote TLS server. This
  might lead to the outbound connection being established to a possibly malicious remote TLS
  server and hence disclose information. Integrity and Availability are not impacted.
