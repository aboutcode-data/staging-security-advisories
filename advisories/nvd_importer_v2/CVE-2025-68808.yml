summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership

  vidtv_channel_si_init() creates a temporary list (program, service, event)
  and ownership of the memory itself is transferred to the PAT/SDT/EIT
  tables through vidtv_psi_pat_program_assign(),
  vidtv_psi_sdt_service_assign(), vidtv_psi_eit_event_assign().

  The problem here is that the local pointer where the memory ownership
  transfer was completed is not initialized to NULL. This causes the
  vidtv_psi_pmt_create_sec_for_each_pat_entry() function to fail, and
  in the flow that jumps to free_eit, the memory that was freed by
  vidtv_psi_*_table_destroy() can be accessed again by
  vidtv_psi_*_event_destroy() due to the uninitialized local pointer, so it
  is freed once again.

  Therefore, to prevent use-after-free and double-free vulnerability,
  local pointers must be initialized to NULL when transferring memory
  ownership.
