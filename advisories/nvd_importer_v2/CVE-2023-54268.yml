summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  debugobjects: Don't wake up kswapd from fill_pool()

  syzbot is reporting a lockdep warning in fill_pool() because the allocation
  from debugobjects is using GFP_ATOMIC, which is (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM)
  and therefore tries to wake up kswapd, which acquires kswapd_wait::lock.

  Since fill_pool() might be called with arbitrary locks held, fill_pool()
  should not assume that acquiring kswapd_wait::lock is safe.

  Use __GFP_HIGH instead and remove __GFP_NORETRY as it is pointless for
  !__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation.
