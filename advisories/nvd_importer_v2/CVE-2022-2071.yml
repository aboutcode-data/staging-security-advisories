aliases: []
summary: The Name Directory WordPress plugin before 1.25.4 does not have CSRF check when importing
  names, and is also lacking sanitisation as well as escaping in some of the imported data,
  which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin import arbitrary names with XSS payloads
  in them.
