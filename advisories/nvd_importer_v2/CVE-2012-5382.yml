aliases: []
summary: 'Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in Zend Server
  5.6.0 SP4, when installed in the top-level C:\ directory, might allow local users to gain
  privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\Zend\ZendServer\share\ZendFramework\bin directory,
  which may be added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated
  by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system
  service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release
  Preview. NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the choice of C:\ (and the resulting unsafe
  PATH) is established by an administrative action that is not a default part of the Zend Server
  installation'
