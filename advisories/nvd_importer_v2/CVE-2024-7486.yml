aliases: []
summary: The MultiPurpose theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.0 via deserialization of untrusted input through the 'wpeden_post_meta'
  post meta. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access
  and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software.
  If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system,
  it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code.
