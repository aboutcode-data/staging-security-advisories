summary: OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Discovery beacons (Bonjour/mDNS and DNS-SD) include
  TXT records such as `lanHost`, `tailnetDns`, `gatewayPort`, and `gatewayTlsSha256`. TXT records
  are unauthenticated. Prior to version 2026.2.14, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative
  routing/pinning inputs. iOS and macOS used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`)
  and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL. iOS and Android allowed the discovery-provided
  TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously stored TLS pin. On a shared/untrusted
  LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client
  to connect to an attacker-controlled endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially
  exfiltrating Gateway credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection. As of
  time of publication, the iOS and Android apps are alpha/not broadly shipped (no public App
  Store / Play Store release). Practical impact is primarily limited to developers/testers running
  those builds, plus any other shipped clients relying on discovery on a shared/untrusted LAN.
  Version 2026.2.14 fixes the issue. Clients now prefer the resolved service endpoint (SRV +
  A/AAAA) over TXT-provided routing hints. Discovery-provided fingerprints no longer override
  stored TLS pins. In iOS/Android, first-time TLS pins require explicit user confirmation (fingerprint
  shown; no silent TOFU) and discovery-based direct connects are TLS-only. In Android, hostname
  verification is no longer globally disabled (only bypassed when pinning).
