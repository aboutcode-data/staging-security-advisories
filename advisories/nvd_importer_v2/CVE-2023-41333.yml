aliases: []
summary: Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  An attacker with the ability to create or modify CiliumNetworkPolicy objects in a particular
  namespace is able to affect traffic on an entire Cilium cluster, potentially bypassing policy
  enforcement in other namespaces. By using a crafted `endpointSelector` that uses the `DoesNotExist`
  operator on the `reserved:init` label, the attacker can create policies that bypass namespace
  restrictions and affect the entire Cilium cluster. This includes potentially allowing or denying
  all traffic. This attack requires API server access, as described in the Kubernetes API Server
  Attacker section of the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been resolved in Cilium versions
  1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. As a workaround an admission webhook can be used to prevent the
  use of `endpointSelectors` that use the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label
  in CiliumNetworkPolicies.
