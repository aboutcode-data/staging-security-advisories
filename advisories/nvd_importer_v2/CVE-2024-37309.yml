aliases: []
summary: CrateDB is a distributed SQL database. A high-risk vulnerability has been identified
  in versions prior to 5.7.2 where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated renegotiation.
  In this scenario, an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request renegotiation
  of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead to excessive consumption
  of CPU resources, resulting in potential server overload and service disruption. The vulnerability
  was confirmed using an openssl client where the command `R` initiates renegotiation, followed
  by the server confirming with `RENEGOTIATING`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform
  a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated TLS renegotiations.
  This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server, posing a significant
  risk to operational stability and security. TLS 1.3 explicitly forbids renegotiation, since
  it closes a window of opportunity for an attack. Version 5.7.2 of CrateDB contains the fix
  for the issue.
