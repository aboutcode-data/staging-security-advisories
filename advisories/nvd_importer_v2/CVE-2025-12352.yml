aliases: []
summary: The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the copy_post_image() function in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.9.20. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary
  files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This only
  impacts sites that have allow_url_fopen set to `On`, the post creation form enabled along
  with a file upload field for the post
