aliases: []
summary: The xShare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'xshare_plugin_reset()'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
