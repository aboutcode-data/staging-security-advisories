summary: |
  [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the
  text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]

  There are two issues related to the mapping of pages belonging to other
  domains: For one, an assertion is wrong there, where the case actually
  needs handling.  A NULL pointer de-reference could result on a release
  build.  This is CVE-2025-58144.

  And then the P2M lock isn't held until a page reference was actually
  obtained (or the attempt to do so has failed).  Otherwise the page can
  not only change type, but even ownership in between, thus allowing
  domain boundaries to be violated.  This is CVE-2025-58145.
