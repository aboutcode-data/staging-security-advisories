aliases: []
summary: Applications deployed to Cloud Foundry, versions v166 through v227, may be vulnerable
  to a remote disclosure of information, including, but not limited to environment variables
  and bound service details. For applications to be vulnerable, they must have been staged using
  automatic buildpack detection, passed through the Java Buildpack detection script, and allow
  the serving of static content from within the deployed artifact. The default Apache Tomcat
  configuration in the affected java buildpack versions for some basic web application archive
  (WAR) packaged applications are vulnerable to this issue.
