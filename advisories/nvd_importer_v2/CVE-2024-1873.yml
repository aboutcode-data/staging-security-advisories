aliases: []
summary: parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to path traversal and denial of service attacks
  due to an exposed `/select_database` endpoint in version a9d16b0. The endpoint improperly
  handles file paths, allowing attackers to specify absolute paths when interacting with the
  `DiscussionsDB` instance. This flaw enables attackers to create directories anywhere on the
  system where the application has permissions, potentially leading to denial of service by
  creating directories with names of critical files, such as HTTPS certificate files, causing
  server startup failures. Additionally, attackers can manipulate the database path, resulting
  in the loss of client data by constantly changing the file location to an attacker-controlled
  location, scattering the data across the filesystem and making recovery difficult.
