aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/panthor: Fix UAF race between device unplug and FW event processing

  The function panthor_fw_unplug() will free the FW memory sections.
  The problem is that there could still be pending FW events which are yet
  not handled at this point. process_fw_events_work() can in this case try
  to access said freed memory.

  Simply call disable_work_sync() to both drain and prevent future
  invocation of process_fw_events_work().
