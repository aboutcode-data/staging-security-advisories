aliases: []
summary: The Simple:Press plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'sforum_[md5 hash of the WordPress URL]' cookie value in versions up to, and including,
  6.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can
  successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would
  be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for
  the targeted user.
