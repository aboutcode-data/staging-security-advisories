summary: Visual Components (owned by KUKA) is a robotic simulator that allows simulating factories
  and robots in order toimprove planning and decision-making processes. Visual Components software
  requires a special license which can beobtained from a network license server. The network
  license server binds to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) and listensfor packets over UDP port 5093.
  No authentication/authorization is required in order to communicate with theserver. The protocol
  being used is a property protocol by RMS Sentinel which provides the licensing infrastructurefor
  the network license server. RMS Sentinel license manager service exposes UDP port 5093 which
  provides sensitivesystem information that could be leveraged for further exploitation without
  any kind of authentication. Thisinformation includes detailed hardware and OS characteristics.After
  a decryption process, a textual protocol is found which contains a simple header with the
  requested command,application-identifier, and some arguments. The protocol leaks information
  regarding the receiving serverinformation, license information and managing licenses, among
  others.Through this flaw, attackers can retreive information about a KUKA simulation system,
  particularly, the version ofthe licensing server, which is connected to the simulator, and
  which will allow them to launch local simulationswith similar characteristics, further understanding
  the dynamics of motion virtualization and opening doors toother attacks (see RVDP#711 and
  RVDP#712 for subsequent vulnerabilities that compromise integrity andavailability).Beyond
  compromising simulations, Visual Components provides capabilities to interface with industrial
  machinery.Particularly, their PLC Connectivity feature 'makes it easy' to connect simulations
  with control systems usingeither the industry standard OPC UA or other supported vendor specific
  interfaces. This fills the gap of jumpingfrom simulation to real and enables attackers to
  pivot from the Visual Components simulator to robots or otherIndustrial Control System (ICS)
  devices, such as PLCs.
