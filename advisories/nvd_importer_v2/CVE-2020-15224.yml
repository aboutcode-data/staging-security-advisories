aliases: []
summary: In Open Enclave before version 0.12.0, an information disclosure vulnerability exists
  when an enclave application using the syscalls provided by the sockets.edl is loaded by a
  malicious host application. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could
  read privileged data from the enclave heap across trust boundaries. To exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.
  The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly, but it could
  be used to obtain information otherwise considered confidential in an enclave, which could
  be used in further compromises. The issue has been addressed in version 0.12.0 and the current
  master branch. Users will need to to recompile their applications against the patched libraries
  to be protected from this vulnerability.
