aliases: []
summary: Applications in cf-release before 245 can be configured and pushed with a user-provided
  custom buildpack using a URL pointing to the buildpack. Although it is not recommended, a
  user can specify a credential in the URL (basic auth or OAuth) to access the buildpack through
  the CLI. For example, the user could include a GitHub username and password in the URL to
  access a private repo. Because the URL to access the buildpack is stored unencrypted, an operator
  with privileged access to the Cloud Controller database could view these credentials.
