aliases: []
summary: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. Due to an improperly
  applied permission check in the `wagtail.contrib.settings` module, a user with access to the
  Wagtail admin and knowledge of the URL of the edit view for a settings model can access and
  update that setting, even when they have not been granted permission over the model. The vulnerability
  is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched
  versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.5 and 6.1.2. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are
  unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched
  version can avoid the vulnerability in `ModelViewSet` by registering the model as a snippet
  instead. No workaround is available for `wagtail.contrib.settings`.
