aliases: []
summary: RaspberryMatic is an open-source operating system for HomeMatic internet-of-things
  devices. RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated
  remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based
  `HMIPServer.jar` component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based `HMIPServer`, that can be
  accessed through URLs starting with `/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however
  not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session.
  Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full
  system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch.
