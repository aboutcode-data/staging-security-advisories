  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sched: fix warning in sched_setaffinity

  Commit 8f9ea86fdf99b added some logic to sched_setaffinity that included
  a WARN when a per-task affinity assignment races with a cpuset update.

  Specifically, we can have a race where a cpuset update results in the
  task affinity no longer being a subset of the cpuset. That's fine; we
  have a fallback to instead use the cpuset mask. However, we have a WARN
  set up that will trigger if the cpuset mask has no overlap at all with
  the requested task affinity. This shouldn't be a warning condition; its
  trivial to create this condition.

  Reproduced the warning by the following setup:

  - $PID inside a cpuset cgroup
  - another thread repeatedly switching the cpuset cpus from 1-2 to just 1
  - another thread repeatedly setting the $PID affinity (via taskset) to 2
