  wifi: ath12k: fix firmware crash due to invalid peer nss

  Currently, if the access point receives an association
  request containing an Extended HE Capabilities Information
  Element with an invalid MCS-NSS, it triggers a firmware
  crash.

  This issue arises when EHT-PHY capabilities shows support
  for a bandwidth and MCS-NSS set for that particular
  bandwidth is filled by zeros and due to this, driver obtains
  peer_nss as 0 and sending this value to firmware causes
  crash.

  Address this issue by implementing a validation step for
  the peer_nss value before passing it to the firmware. If
  the value is greater than zero, proceed with forwarding
  it to the firmware. However, if the value is invalid,
  reject the association request to prevent potential
  firmware crashes.
