aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting
  with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug
  which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page
  in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single
  sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's
  encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to
  convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified
  as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level
  of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would
  not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption
  key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5
  and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.
