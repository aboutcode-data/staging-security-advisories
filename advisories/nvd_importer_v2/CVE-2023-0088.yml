summary: The Swifty Page Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions, via forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
