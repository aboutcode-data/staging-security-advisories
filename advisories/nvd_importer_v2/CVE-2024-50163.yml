summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap

  The bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,
  and the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags
  field (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that
  if skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,
  subsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same
  bpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up
  crashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.

  With the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer
  shared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen
  anymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag
  values in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so
  this patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and
  redefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap
  with the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make
  sure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.
