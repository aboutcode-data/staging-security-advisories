aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7 and below, a
  vulnerability in the way Cursor CLI Agent protects its sensitive files (i.e. */.cursor/cli.json)
  allows attackers to modify the content of the files through prompt injection, thus achieving
  remote code execution. A prompt injection can lead to full RCE through modifying sensitive
  files on case-insensitive filesystems. This issue is fixed in a commit, 25b418f, but has yet
  to be released as of October 3, 2025.
