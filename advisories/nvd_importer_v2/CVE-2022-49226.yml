  net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors

  Syzbot once again hit uninit value in asix driver. The problem still the
  same -- asix_read_cmd() reads less bytes, than was requested by caller.

  Since all read requests are performed via asix_read_cmd() let's catch
  usb related error there and add __must_check notation to be sure all
  callers actually check return value.

  So, this patch adds sanity check inside asix_read_cmd(), that simply
  checks if bytes read are not less, than was requested and adds missing
  error handling of asix_read_cmd() all across the driver code.
