aliases: []
summary: |
  A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation
  which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a
  Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker
  would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for
  decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
  RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

  For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an
  encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
  genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
  trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a
  sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
  secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
  application data sent over that connection.
