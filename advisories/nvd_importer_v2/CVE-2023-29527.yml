summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. In affected versions a user without script or programming right may edit
  a user profile (or any other document) with the wiki editor and add groovy script content.
  Viewing the document after saving it will execute the groovy script in the server context
  which provides code execution. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1 and
  14.10.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
