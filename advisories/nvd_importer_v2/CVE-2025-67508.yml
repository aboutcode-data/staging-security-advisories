aliases: []
summary: gardenctl is a command-line client for the Gardener which configures access to clusters
  and cloud provider CLI tools. When using non‑POSIX shells such as Fish and PowerShell, versions
  2.11.0 and below of gardenctl allow an attacker with administrative privileges for a Gardener
  project to craft malicious credential values. The forged credential values are used in infrastructure
  Secret objects that break out of the intended string context when evaluated in Fish or PowerShell
  environments used by the Gardener service operators. This issue is fixed in version 2.12.0.
