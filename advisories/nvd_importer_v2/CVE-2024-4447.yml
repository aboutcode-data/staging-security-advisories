summary: "In the System → Maintenance tool, the Logged Users tab surfaces sessionId data for\
  \ all users via the Direct Web Remoting API (UserSessionAjax.getSessionList.dwr) calls. While\
  \ this is information that would and should be available to admins who possess \"Sign In As\"\
  \ powers, admins who otherwise lack this privilege would still be able to utilize the session\
  \ IDs to imitate other users.\n\n\nWhile this is a very small attack vector that requires\
  \ very high permissions to execute, its danger lies principally in obfuscating attribution;\
  \ all Sign In As operations are attributed appropriately in the log files, and a malicious\
  \ administrator could use this information to render their dealings untraceable — including\
  \ those admins who have not been granted this ability — such as by using a session ID to generate\
  \ an API token.\n\nFixed in: 24.07.12 / 23.01.20 LTS / 23.10.24v13 LTS / 24.04.24v5 LTS\n\n\
  This was the original found by researcher Zakaria Agharghar.\n\n\n\n\n2. Later, on October\
  \ 20, 2025, another researcher (Chris O’Neill) found additional affected DWR Endpoints that\
  \ are vulnerable to Information Disclosure, namely and in addition to the original found of\
  \ \"UserSessionAjax.getSessionList.dwr - Session ID exposure\":\n\n\n\n  *  UserAjax.getUsersList.dwr\
  \ - Enumerate all users with IDs, names, emails\n\n  *  RoleAjax.getUserRole.dwr - Get user\
  \ role information\n\n  *  RoleAjax.getRole.dwr - Get role details\n\n  *  RoleAjax.getRolePermissions.dwr\
  \ - View role permissions\n\n  *  RoleAjax.isPermissionableInheriting.dwr - Check permission\
  \ inheritance\n\n  *  RoleAjax.getCurrentCascadePermissionsJobs.dwr - View permission cascade\
  \ jobs\n\n  *  ThreadMonitorTool.getThreads.dwr - Monitor system threads; and,\n\n  *  CRITICAL\
  \ - Privilege Escalation: RoleAjax.saveRolePermission.dwr - Modify role permissions\n\n\n\
