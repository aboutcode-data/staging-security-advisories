summary: The Holiday class post calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
  in all versions up to, and including, 7.1 via the 'contents' parameter. This is due to a lack
  of sanitization of user-supplied data when creating a cache file. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.
