aliases: []
summary: The Image Resizer On The Fly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to insufficient file path validation in the 'delete' task in all versions up to, and including,
  1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the
  server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such
  as wp-config.php).
