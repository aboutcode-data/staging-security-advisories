aliases: []
summary: 'In the orders section of PrestaShop before 1.7.2.5, an attack is possible after gaining
  access to a target store with a user role with the rights of at least a Salesman or higher
  privileges. The attacker can then inject arbitrary PHP objects into the process and abuse
  an object chain in order to gain Remote Code Execution. This occurs because protection against
  serialized objects looks for a 0: followed by an integer, but does not consider 0:+ followed
  by an integer.'
