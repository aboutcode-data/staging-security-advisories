  io_uring/cmd_net: fix wrong argument types for skb_queue_splice()

  If timestamp retriving needs to be retried and the local list of
  SKB's already has entries, then it's spliced back into the socket
  queue. However, the arguments for the splice helper are transposed,
  causing exactly the wrong direction of splicing into the on-stack
  list. Fix that up.
