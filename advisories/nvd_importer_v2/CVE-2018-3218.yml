summary: 'Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component of Oracle Fusion Middleware
  (subcomponent: Outside In Filters). The supported version that is affected are 8.5.3 and 8.5.4.
  Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP
  to compromise Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks require human interaction from
  a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
  access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Outside In Technology accessible
  data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Outside In
  Technology accessible data. Note: Outside In Technology is a suite of software development
  kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology
  code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly
  to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may
  be lower. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.1 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N).'
