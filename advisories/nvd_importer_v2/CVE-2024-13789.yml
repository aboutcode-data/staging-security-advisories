datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13789
aliases: []
summary: The ravpage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.31 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'paramsv2' parameter.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP
  chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact
  unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain
  is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow
  the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute
  code depending on the POP chain present.
