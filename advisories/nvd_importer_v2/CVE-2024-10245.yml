summary: The Relais 2FA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to incorrect authentication and capability checking
  in the 'rl_do_ajax' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log
  in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the
  email.
