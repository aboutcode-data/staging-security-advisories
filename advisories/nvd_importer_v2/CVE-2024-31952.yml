summary: An issue was discovered in Samsung Magician 8.0.0 on macOS. Because symlinks are used
  during the installation process, an attacker can escalate privileges via arbitrary file permission
  writes. (The attacker must already have user privileges, and an administrator password must
  be entered during the program installation stage for privilege escalation.)
