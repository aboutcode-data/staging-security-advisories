aliases: []
summary: Cloudflare WARP client for Windows (up to v2023.3.381.0) allowed a malicious actor
  to remotely access the warp-svc.exe binary due to an insufficient access control policy on
  an IPC Named Pipe. This would have enabled an attacker to trigger WARP connect and disconnect
  commands, as well as obtaining network diagnostics and application configuration from the
  target's device. It is important to note that in order to exploit this, a set of requirements
  would need to be met, such as the target's device must've been reachable on port 445, allowed
  authentication with NULL sessions or otherwise having knowledge of the target's credentials.
