summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: phy: micrel: always set shared->phydev for LAN8814

  Currently, during the LAN8814 PTP probe shared->phydev is only set if PTP
  clock gets actually set, otherwise the function will return before setting
  it.

  This is an issue as shared->phydev is unconditionally being used when IRQ
  is being handled, especially in lan8814_gpio_process_cap and since it was
  not set it will cause a NULL pointer exception and crash the kernel.

  So, simply always set shared->phydev to avoid the NULL pointer exception.
