aliases: []
summary: The Light Messages WordPress plugin through 1.0 is lacking CSRF check when updating
  it's settings, and is not sanitising its Message Content in them (even with the unfiltered_html
  disallowed). As a result, an attacker could make a logged in admin update the settings to
  arbitrary values, and set a Cross-Site Scripting payload in the Message Content. Depending
  on the options set, the XSS payload can be triggered either in the backend only (in the plugin's
  settings), or both frontend and backend.
