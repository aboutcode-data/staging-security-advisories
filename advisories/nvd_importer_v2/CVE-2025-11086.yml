summary: The Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.7. This is
  due to the plugin not properly validating a user's role prior to registering a user via the
  Social Login addon. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update their role
  to Administrator when registering on the site.
