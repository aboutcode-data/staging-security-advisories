summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Pass the PMK in binary instead of hex

  Apparently the hex passphrase mechanism does not work on newer
  chips/firmware (e.g. BCM4387). It seems there was a simple way of
  passing it in binary all along, so use that and avoid the hexification.

  OpenBSD has been doing it like this from the beginning, so this should
  work on all chips.

  Also clear the structure before setting the PMK. This was leaking
  uninitialized stack contents to the device.
