summary: The Autoptimize WordPress plugin before 2.7.8 attempts to remove potential malicious
  files from the extracted archive uploaded via the 'Import Settings' feature, however this
  is not sufficient to protect against RCE as a race condition can be achieved in between the
  moment the file is extracted on the disk but not yet removed. It is a bypass of CVE-2020-24948.
