aliases: []
summary: Grav is an open-source, flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.45,
  due to the unrestricted access to twig extension class from Grav context, an attacker can
  redefine config variable. As a result, attacker can bypass a previous SSTI mitigation. Twig
  processing of static pages can be enabled in the front matter by any administrative user allowed
  to create or edit pages. As the Twig processor runs unsandboxed, this behavior can be used
  to gain arbitrary code execution and elevate privileges on the instance. Version 1.7.45 contains
  a fix for this issue.
