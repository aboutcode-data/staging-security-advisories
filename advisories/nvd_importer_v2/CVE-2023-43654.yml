aliases: []
summary: 'TorchServe is a tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in production. TorchServe
  default configuration lacks proper input validation, enabling third parties to invoke remote
  HTTP download requests and write files to the disk. This issue could be taken advantage of
  to compromise the integrity of the system and sensitive data. This issue is present in versions
  0.1.0 to 0.8.1. A user is able to load the model of their choice from any URL that they would
  like to use. The user of TorchServe is responsible for configuring both the allowed_urls and
  specifying the model URL to be used. A pull request to warn the user when the default value
  for allowed_urls is used has been merged in PR #2534. TorchServe release 0.8.2 includes this
  change. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.'
