aliases: []
summary: The Ultimate Multi Design Video Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level
  access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
