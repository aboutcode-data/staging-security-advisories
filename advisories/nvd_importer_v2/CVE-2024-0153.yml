summary: 'Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability
  in Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Firmware, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware allows a local
  non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to access a limited amount
  outside of buffer bounds. If the operations are carefully prepared, then this in turn could
  give them access to all system memory. This issue affects Valhall GPU Firmware: from r29p0
  through r46p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware: from r41p0 through r46p0.'
