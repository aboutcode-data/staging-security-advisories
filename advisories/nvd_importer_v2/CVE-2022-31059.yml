aliases: []
summary: Discourse Calendar is a calendar plugin for Discourse, an open-source messaging app.
  Prior to version 1.0.1, parsing and rendering of Event names can be susceptible to cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled
  Discourse’s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the
  Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled,
  and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.
