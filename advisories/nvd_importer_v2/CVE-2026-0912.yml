aliases: []
summary: The Toret Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of
  data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the 'trman_save_option'
  function and on the 'trman_save_option_items' in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.7.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
  to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default
  role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain
  administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
