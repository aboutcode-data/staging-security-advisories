aliases: []
summary: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant
  registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0
  and before version 0.9.0, there is a "zip-slip" vulnerability. The directory support feature
  allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified
  directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball
  or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files
  on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same
  permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted
  if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke
  `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0.
  For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider.
  For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`,
  and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.
