aliases: []
summary: The Big File Uploads – Increase Maximum File Upload Size plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due the plugin
  not sanitizing a file path in an error message. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with author-level access and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which
  can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and
  requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
