aliases: []
summary: The Database Toolset plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient
  file path validation in a function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can
  easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
