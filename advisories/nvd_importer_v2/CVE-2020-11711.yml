aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Stormshield SNS 3.8.0. Authenticated Stored XSS in the admin
  login panel leads to SSL VPN credential theft. A malicious disclaimer file can be uploaded
  from the admin panel. The resulting file is rendered on the authentication interface of the
  admin panel. It is possible to inject malicious HTML content in order to execute JavaScript
  inside a victim's browser. This results in a stored XSS on the authentication interface of
  the admin panel. Moreover, an unsecured authentication form is present on the authentication
  interface of the SSL VPN captive portal. Users are allowed to save their credentials inside
  the browser. If an administrator saves his credentials through this unsecured form, these
  credentials could be stolen via the stored XSS on the admin panel without user interaction.
  Another possible exploitation would be modification of the authentication form of the admin
  panel into a malicious form.
