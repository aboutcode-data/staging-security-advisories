aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /Upgrade/FixConfig route
  in Open Library Foundation VuFind 2.0 through 9.1 before 9.1.1 allows a remote attacker to
  overwrite local configuration files to gain access to the administrator panel and achieve
  Remote Code Execution. A mitigating factor is that it requires the allow_url_include PHP runtime
  setting to be on, which is off in default installations. It also requires the /Upgrade route
  to be exposed, which is exposed by default after installing VuFind, and is recommended to
  be disabled by setting autoConfigure to false in config.ini.
