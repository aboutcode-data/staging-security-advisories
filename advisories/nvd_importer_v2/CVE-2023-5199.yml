aliases: []
summary: The PHP to Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable Local File Inclusion to Remote Code
  Execution in versions up to, and including, 0.3 via the 'php-to-page' shortcode. This allows
  authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above, to include local file
  and potentially execute code on the server. While subscribers may need to poison log files
  or otherwise get a file installed in order to achieve remote code execution, author and above
  users can upload files by default and achieve remote code execution easily.
