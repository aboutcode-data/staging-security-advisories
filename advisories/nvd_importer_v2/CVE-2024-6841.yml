aliases: []
summary: A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest commit (56b782bcefd2e59b19cd7ba7878b95f54884f502)
  of the vanna-ai/vanna repository. Two endpoints in the built-in web app that provide SQL functionality
  are implemented as simple GET requests, making them susceptible to CSRF attacks. This vulnerability
  allows an attacker to run arbitrary SQL commands via CSRF without the target intending to
  expose the web app to the network or other users. The impact is limited to data alteration
  or deletion, as the attacker cannot read the results of the query.
