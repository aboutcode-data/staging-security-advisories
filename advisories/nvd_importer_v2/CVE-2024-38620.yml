  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: HCI: Remove HCI_AMP support

  Since BT_HS has been remove HCI_AMP controllers no longer has any use so
  remove it along with the capability of creating AMP controllers.

  Since we no longer need to differentiate between AMP and Primary
  controllers, as only HCI_PRIMARY is left, this also remove
  hdev->dev_type altogether.
