aliases: []
summary: NetExec is a network execution tool. Prior to version 1.5.1, the module spider_plus
  improperly creates the output file and folder path when saving files from SMB shares. It does
  not take into account that it is possible for Linux SMB shares to have path traversal characters
  such as `../` in them. An attacker can craft a filename in an SMB share that includes these
  characters, which when spider_plus crawls and downloads, can write or overwrite arbitrary
  files. The issue is patched in v1.5.1. As a workaround, do not run spider_plus with DOWNLOAD=true
  against targets.
