aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Starting in version 3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.10.8 and
  15.3-rc-1, triggering the office converter with a specially crafted file name allows writing
  the attachment's content to an attacker-controlled location on the server as long as the Java
  process has write access to that location. In particular in the combination with attachment
  moving, a feature introduced in XWiki 14.0, this is easy to reproduce but it also possible
  to reproduce in versions as old as XWiki 3.5 by uploading the attachment through the REST
  API which doesn't remove `/` or `\` from the filename. As the mime type of the attachment
  doesn't matter for the exploitation, this could e.g., be used to replace the `jar`-file of
  an extension which would allow executing arbitrary Java code and thus impact the confidentiality,
  integrity and availability of the XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched
  in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.3RC1. There are no known workarounds apart from disabling the office
  converter.
