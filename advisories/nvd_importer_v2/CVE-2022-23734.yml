aliases: []
summary: A deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise
  Server that could potentially lead to remote code execution on the SVNBridge. To exploit this
  vulnerability, an attacker would need to gain access via a server-side request forgery (SSRF)
  that would let an attacker control the data being deserialized. This vulnerability affected
  all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to v3.6 and was fixed in versions 3.5.3, 3.4.6,
  3.3.11, and 3.2.16. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
