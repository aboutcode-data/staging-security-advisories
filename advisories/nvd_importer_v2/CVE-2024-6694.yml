aliases: []
summary: The WP Mail SMTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information exposure in all
  versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This is due to plugin providing the SMTP password in
  the SMTP Password field when viewing the settings. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrative-level access and above, to view the SMTP password for the supplied
  server. Although this would not be useful for attackers in most cases, if an administrator
  account becomes compromised this could be useful information to an attacker in a limited environment.
