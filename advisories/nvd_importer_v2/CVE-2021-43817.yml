aliases: []
summary: Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology.
  In affected versions a reflected XSS vulnerability was found in Collabora Online. An attacker
  could inject unescaped HTML into a variable as they created the Collabora Online iframe, and
  execute scripts inside the context of the Collabora Online iframe. This would give access
  to a small set of user settings stored in the browser, as well as the session's authentication
  token which was also passed in at iframe creation time. Users should upgrade to Collabora
  Online 6.4.16 or higher or Collabora Online 4.2.20 or higher. Collabora Online Development
  Edition 21.11 is not affected.
