summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netfilter: nf_tables: always release netdev hooks from notifier

  This reverts "netfilter: nf_tables: skip netdev events generated on netns removal".

  The problem is that when a veth device is released, the veth release
  callback will also queue the peer netns device for removal.

  Its possible that the peer netns is also slated for removal.  In this
  case, the device memory is already released before the pre_exit hook of
  the peer netns runs:

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in nf_hook_entry_head+0x1b8/0x1d0
  Read of size 8 at addr ffff88812c0124f0 by task kworker/u8:1/45
  Workqueue: netns cleanup_net
  Call Trace:
   nf_hook_entry_head+0x1b8/0x1d0
   __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x76/0x510
   nft_netdev_unregister_hooks+0xa0/0x220
   __nft_release_hook+0x184/0x490
   nf_tables_pre_exit_net+0x12f/0x1b0
   ..

  Order is:
  1. First netns is released, veth_dellink() queues peer netns device
     for removal
  2. peer netns is queued for removal
  3. peer netns device is released, unreg event is triggered
  4. unreg event is ignored because netns is going down
  5. pre_exit hook calls nft_netdev_unregister_hooks but device memory
     might be free'd already.
