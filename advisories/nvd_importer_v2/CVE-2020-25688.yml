aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in rhacm versions before 2.0.5 and before 2.1.0. Two internal service
  APIs were incorrectly provisioned using a test certificate from the source repository. This
  would result in all installations using the same certificates. If an attacker could observe
  network traffic internal to a cluster, they could use the private key to decode API requests
  that should be protected by TLS sessions, potentially obtaining information they would not
  otherwise be able to. These certificates are not used for service authentication, so no opportunity
  for impersonation or active MITM attacks were made possible.
