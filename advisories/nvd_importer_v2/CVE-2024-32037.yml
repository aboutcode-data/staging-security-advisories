aliases: []
summary: GeoNetwork is a catalog application to manage spatially referenced resources. In versions
  prior to 4.2.10 and 4.4.5, the search end-point response headers contain information about
  Elasticsearch software in use. This information is valuable from a security point of view
  because it allows software used by the server to be easily identified. GeoNetwork 4.4.5 and
  4.2.10 fix this issue. No known workarounds are available.
