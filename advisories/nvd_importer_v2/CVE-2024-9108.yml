aliases: []
summary: The Wechat Social login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to insufficient file type validation in the 'convert_remoteimage_to_local' function in
  versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution
  possible.
