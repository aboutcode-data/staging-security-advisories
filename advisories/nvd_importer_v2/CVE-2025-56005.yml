aliases: []
summary: 'An undocumented and unsafe feature in the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library 3.11 allows
  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the `picklefile` parameter in the `yacc()` function. This
  parameter accepts a `.pkl` file that is deserialized with `pickle.load()` without validation.
  Because `pickle` allows execution of embedded code via `__reduce__()`, an attacker can achieve
  code execution by passing a malicious pickle file. The parameter is not mentioned in official
  documentation or the GitHub repository, yet it is active in the PyPI version. This introduces
  a stealthy backdoor and persistence risk. NOTE: A third-party states that this vulnerability
  should be rejected because the proof of concept does not demonstrate arbitrary code execution
  and fails to complete successfully.'
