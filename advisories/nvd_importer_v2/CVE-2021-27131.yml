aliases: []
summary: 'Moodle 3.10.1 is vulnerable to persistent/stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to
  the improper input sanitization on the "Additional HTML Section" via "Header and Footer" parameter
  in /admin/settings.php. This vulnerability is leading an attacker to steal admin and all user
  account cookies by storing the malicious XSS payload in Header and Footer. NOTE: this is disputed
  by the vendor because the "Additional HTML Section" for "Header and Footer" can only be supplied
  by an administrator, who is intentionally allowed to enter unsanitized input (e.g., site-specific
  JavaScript).'
