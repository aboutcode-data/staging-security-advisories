aliases: []
summary: The Campaign Monitor for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path
  Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.15. This is due the plugin not properly
  restricting direct access to /forms/views/admin/create.php and display_errors being enabled.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web
  application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful
  on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
