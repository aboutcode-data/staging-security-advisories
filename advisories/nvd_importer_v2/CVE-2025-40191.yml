  drm/amdkfd: Fix kfd process ref leaking when userptr unmapping

  kfd_lookup_process_by_pid hold the kfd process reference to ensure it
  doesn't get destroyed while sending the segfault event to user space.

  Calling kfd_lookup_process_by_pid as function parameter leaks the kfd
  process refcount and miss the NULL pointer check if app process is
  already destroyed.
