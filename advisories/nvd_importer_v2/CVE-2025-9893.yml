aliases: []
summary: The VM Menu Reorder plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the vm_set_to_default function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to reset all menu reordering settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
