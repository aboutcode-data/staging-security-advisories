aliases: []
summary: The Felan Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper authentication in
  versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to the hardcoded password in the 'fb_ajax_login_or_register'
  function and in the 'google_ajax_login_or_register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they registered with facebook or
  google social login and did not change their password.
