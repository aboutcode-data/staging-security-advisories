aliases: []
summary: Zcash, before the Sapling network upgrade (2018-10-28), had a counterfeiting vulnerability.
  A key-generation process, during evaluation of polynomials related to a to-be-proven statement,
  produced certain bypass elements. Availability of these elements allowed a cheating prover
  to bypass a consistency check, and consequently transform the proof of one statement into
  an ostensibly valid proof of a different statement, thereby breaking the soundness of the
  proof system. This misled the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier into accepting the correctness
  of a transaction.
