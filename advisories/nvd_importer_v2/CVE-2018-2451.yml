summary: XS Command-Line Interface (CLI) user sessions with the SAP HANA Extended Application
  Services (XS), version 1, advanced server may have an unintentional prolonged period of validity.
  Consequently, a platform user could access controller resources via active CLI session even

  an attacker who managed to gain access to the platform user's session might misuse the session
  token even after the session has been closed.
