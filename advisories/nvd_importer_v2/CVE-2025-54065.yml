aliases: []
summary: GZDoom is a feature centric port for all Doom engine games. GZDoom is an open source
  Doom engine. In versions 4.14.2 and earlier, ZScript actor state handling allows scripts to
  read arbitrary addresses, write constants into the JIT-compiled code section, and redirect
  control flow through crafted FState and VMFunction structures. A script can copy FState structures
  into a writable buffer, modify function pointers and state transitions, and cause execution
  of attacker-controlled bytecode, leading to arbitrary code execution.
