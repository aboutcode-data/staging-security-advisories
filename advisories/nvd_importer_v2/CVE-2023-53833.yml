  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state

  intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't
  obtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must check it
  for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee
  that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.
  We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was
  confirmed to help.

  (cherry picked from commit 1d5b09f8daf859247a1ea65b0d732a24d88980d8)
