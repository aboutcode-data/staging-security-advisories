aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) feature\
  \ of Cisco NX-OS Software for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series\
  \ Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause\
  \ the IS-IS process to unexpectedly restart, which could cause an affected device to reload.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when parsing an ingress IS-IS\
  \ packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to\
  \ an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the unexpected\
  \ restart of the IS-IS process, which could cause the affected device to reload, resulting\
  \ in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nNote: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol.\
  \ To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device."
