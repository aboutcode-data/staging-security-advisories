aliases: []
summary: parisneo/lollms version 9.5 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks due
  to insufficient path sanitization. The `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` function fails to properly
  sanitize Windows-style paths (backward slash `\`), allowing attackers to perform directory
  traversal attacks on Windows systems. This vulnerability can be exploited through various
  routes, including `personalities` and `/del_preset`, to read or delete any file on the Windows
  filesystem, compromising the system's availability.
