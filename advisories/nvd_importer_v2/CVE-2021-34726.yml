summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed with root-level privileges on the underlying
  operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation
  on certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to
