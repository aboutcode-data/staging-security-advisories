summary: |
  In Wagtail before versions 2.8.1 and 2.7.2, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on the page revision
  comparison view within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail
  admin could potentially craft a page revision history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform
  actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to
  the Wagtail admin.

  Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch).
