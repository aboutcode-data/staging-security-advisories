aliases: []
summary: Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Prior
  to 1.5.0, a command injection vulnerability allows authenticated users with write permissions
  to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Signal K server when the set-system-time plugin
  is enabled. Unauthenticated users can also exploit this vulnerability if security is disabled
  on the Signal K server. This occurs due to unsafe construction of shell commands when processing
  navigation.datetime values received via WebSocket delta messages. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.5.0.
