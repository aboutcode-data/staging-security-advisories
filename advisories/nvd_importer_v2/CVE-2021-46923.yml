summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs/mount_setattr: always cleanup mount_kattr

  Make sure that finish_mount_kattr() is called after mount_kattr was
  succesfully built in both the success and failure case to prevent
  leaking any references we took when we built it.  We returned early if
  path lookup failed thereby risking to leak an additional reference we
  took when building mount_kattr when an idmapped mount was requested.
