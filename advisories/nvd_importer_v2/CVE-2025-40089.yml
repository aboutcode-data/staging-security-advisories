summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cxl/features: Add check for no entries in cxl_feature_info

  cxl EDAC calls cxl_feature_info() to get the feature information and
  if the hardware has no Features support, cxlfs may be passed in as
  NULL.

  [   51.957498] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008

  Add a check for cxlfs before dereferencing it and return -EOPNOTSUPP if
  there is no cxlfs created due to no hardware support.
