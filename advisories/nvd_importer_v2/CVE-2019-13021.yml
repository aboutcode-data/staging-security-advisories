aliases: []
summary: The administrative passwords for all versions of Bond JetSelect are stored within an
  unprotected file on the filesystem, rather than encrypted within the MySQL database. This
  backup copy of the passwords is made as part of the installation script, after the administrator
  has generated a password using ENCtool.jar (see CVE-2019-13022). This allows any low-privilege
  user who can read this file to trivially obtain the passwords for the administrative accounts
  of the JetSelect application. The path to the file containing the encoded password hash is
  /opt/JetSelect/SFC/resources/sfc-general-properties.
