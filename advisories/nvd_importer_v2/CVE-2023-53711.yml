  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  NFS: Fix a potential data corruption

  We must ensure that the subrequests are joined back into the head before
  we can retransmit a request. If the head was not on the commit lists,
  because the server wrote it synchronously, we still need to add it back
  to the retransmission list.
  Add a call that mirrors the effect of nfs_cancel_remove_inode() for
  O_DIRECT.
