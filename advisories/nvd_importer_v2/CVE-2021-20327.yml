  correct validation of the KMS server’s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with
  a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between
  the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side field level encryption (CSFLE)
  ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption
  module version 1.2.0, which was available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry
  on 2021-Feb-04. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported
  key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due
  to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads
  that don’t use Field Level Encryption. This issue affect MongoDB Node.js Driver mongodb-client-encryption
  module version 1.2.0
