aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network
  Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, rules using datasets with the non-functional
  / unimplemented "unset" option can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to
  denial of service. This issue is addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, use only trusted and
  well tested rulesets.
