summary: IncidentReporting is a MediaWiki extension for moving incident reports from wikitext
  to database tables. There are a variety of Cross-site Scripting issues, though all of them
  require elevated permissions. Some are available to anyone who has the `editincidents` right,
  some are available to those who can edit interface messages (typically administrators and
  interface admins), and one is available to those who can edit LocalSettings.php. These issues
  have been addressed in commit `43896a4` and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
  to upgrade should prevent access to the Special:IncidentReports page.
