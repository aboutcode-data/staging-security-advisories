summary: A vulnerability in an API of the Web Bridge feature of Cisco Meeting Server could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending crafted HTTP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to cause a partial availability condition, which could cause ongoing video calls
  to be dropped due to the invalid packets reaching the Web Bridge.
