aliases: []
summary: The Live2DWebCanvas plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due
  to insufficient file path validation in the ClearFiles() function in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.9.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
  code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
