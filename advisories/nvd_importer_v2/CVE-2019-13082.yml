aliases: []
summary: Chamilo LMS 1.11.8 and 2.x allows remote code execution through an lp_upload.php unauthenticated
  file upload feature. It extracts a ZIP archive before checking its content, and once it has
  been extracted, does not check files in a recursive way. This means that by putting a .php
  file in a folder and then this folder in a ZIP archive, the server will accept this file without
  any checks. Because one can access this file from the website, it is remote code execution.
  This is related to a scorm imsmanifest.xml file, the import_package function, and extraction
  in $courseSysDir.$newDir.
