aliases: []
summary: jwe is a Ruby implementation of the RFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE) standard. In
  versions 1.1.0 and below, authentication tags of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced, which
  may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs.
  This puts users at risk because JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value, decrypted
  by observing parsing differences and the GCM internal GHASH key can be recovered. Users are
  affected by this vulnerability even if they do not use an AES-GCM encryption algorithm for
  their JWEs. As the GHASH key may have been leaked, users must rotate the encryption keys after
  upgrading. This issue is fixed in version 1.1.1.
