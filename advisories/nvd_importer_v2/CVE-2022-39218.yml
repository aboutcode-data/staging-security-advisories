aliases: []
summary: The JS Compute Runtime for Fastly's Compute@Edge platform provides the environment
  JavaScript is executed in when using the Compute@Edge JavaScript SDK. In versions prior to
  0.5.3, the `Math.random` and `crypto.getRandomValues` methods fail to use sufficiently random
  values. The initial value to seed the PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) is baked-in to
  the final WebAssembly module, making the sequence of random values for that specific WebAssembly
  module predictable. An attacker can use the fixed seed to predict random numbers generated
  by these functions and bypass cryptographic security controls, for example to disclose sensitive
  data encrypted by functions that use these generators. The problem has been patched in version
  0.5.3. No known workarounds exist.
