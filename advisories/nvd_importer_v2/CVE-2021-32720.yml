aliases: []
summary: Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius
  prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total,
  and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly,
  a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping
  may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could
  be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the
  third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their
  value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1.
  There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide
  the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only
  the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user
  is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is
  to decorate the `\Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\Doctrine\QueryCollectionExtension\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension`
  and throw `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AccessDeniedException` if the class is
  executed for unauthorized user.
