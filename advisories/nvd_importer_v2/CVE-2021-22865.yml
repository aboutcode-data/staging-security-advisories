aliases: []
summary: An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server
  that allowed access tokens generated from a GitHub App's web authentication flow to read private
  repository metadata via the REST API without having been granted the appropriate permissions.
  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance
  and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. The private
  repository metadata returned would be limited to repositories owned by the user the token
  identifies. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to
  3.0.4 and was fixed in versions 3.0.4, 2.22.10, 2.21.18. This vulnerability was reported via
  the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
