aliases: []
summary: 'The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open redirect in version 2.8.4.
  This is due to an insecure OAuth implementation, as the ''redirect_uri'' parameter is missing
  validation during the authorization flow. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to intercept the authorization code and obtain an access token by redirecting the user to
  an attacker-controlled URI. Note: OAuth is disabled, the ''Meow_MWAI_Labs_OAuth'' class is
  not loaded in the plugin in the patched version 2.8.5.'
