aliases: []
summary: dectalk-tts is a Node package to interact with the aeiou Dectalk web API. In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`,
  network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted
  traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could
  be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS
  in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any
  sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it.
