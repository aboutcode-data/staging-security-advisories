summary: The CSV Me plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient
  file type validation in the 'csv_me_options_page' function in all versions up to, and including,
  2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and
  above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
