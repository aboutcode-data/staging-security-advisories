aliases: []
summary: The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 93.0.0. This is due
  to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like
  email and password through the mj_smgt_update_user() and mj_smgt_add_admission() functions,
  along with a local file inclusion vulnerability. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with student-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses
  and passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
  This was escalated four months ago after no response to our initial outreach, yet it still
  vulnerable.
