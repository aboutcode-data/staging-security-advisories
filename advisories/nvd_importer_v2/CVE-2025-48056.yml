aliases: []
summary: Hubble is a fully distributed networking and security observability platform for cloud
  native workloads. Prior to version 1.17.2, a network attacker could inject malicious control
  characters into Hubble CLI terminal output, potentially leading to loss of integrity and manipulation
  of the output. This could be leveraged to conceal log entries, rewrite output, or even make
  the terminal temporarily unusable. Exploitation of this attack would require the victim to
  be monitoring Kafka traffic using Layer 7 Protocol Visibility at the time of the attack. The
  issue is patched in Hubble CLI v1.17.2. Hubble CLI users who are unable to upgrade can direct
  their Hubble flows to a log file and inspect the output within a text editor.
