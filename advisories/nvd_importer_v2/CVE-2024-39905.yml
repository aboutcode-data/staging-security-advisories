aliases: []
summary: Red is a fully modular Discord bot. Due to a bug in Red's Core API, 3rd-party cogs
  using the `@commands.can_manage_channel()` command permission check without additional permission
  controls may authorize a user to run a command even when that user doesn't have permissions
  to manage a channel. None of the core commands or core cogs are affected. The maintainers
  of the project are not aware of any _public_ 3rd-party cog utilizing this API at the time
  of writing this advisory. The problem was patched and released in version 3.5.10.
