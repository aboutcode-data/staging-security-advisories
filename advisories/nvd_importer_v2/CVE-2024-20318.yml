summary: "A vulnerability in the Layer 2 Ethernet services of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the line card network processor to reset,\
  \ resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the\
  \ incorrect handling of specific Ethernet frames that are received on line cards that have\
  \ the Layer 2 services feature enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ specific Ethernet frames through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to cause the ingress interface network processor to reset, resulting in a loss\
  \ of traffic over the interfaces that are supported by the network processor. Multiple resets\
  \ of the network processor would cause the line card to reset, resulting in a DoS condition."
