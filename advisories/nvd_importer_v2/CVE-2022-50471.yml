  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xen/gntdev: Accommodate VMA splitting

  Prior to this commit, the gntdev driver code did not handle the
  following scenario correctly with paravirtualized (PV) Xen domains:

  * User process sets up a gntdev mapping composed of two grant mappings
    (i.e., two pages shared by another Xen domain).
  * User process munmap()s one of the pages.
  * User process munmap()s the remaining page.
  * User process exits.

  In the scenario above, the user process would cause the kernel to log
  the following messages in dmesg for the first munmap(), and the second
  munmap() call would result in similar log messages:

    BUG: Bad page map in process doublemap.test  pte:... pmd:...
    page:0000000057c97bff refcount:1 mapcount:-1 \
      mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x0 pfn:...
    ...
    page dumped because: bad pte

     ...

  For each munmap() call, the Xen hypervisor (if built with CONFIG_DEBUG)
  would print out the following and trigger a general protection fault in
  the affected Xen PV domain:

    (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...
    (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...

  As of this writing, gntdev_grant_map structure's vma field (referred to
  as map->vma below) is mainly used for checking the start and end
  addresses of mappings. However, with split VMAs, these may change, and
  there could be more than one VMA associated with a gntdev mapping.
  Hence, remove the use of map->vma and rely on map->pages_vm_start for
  the original start address and on (map->count << PAGE_SHIFT) for the
  original mapping size. Let the invalidate() and find_special_page()
  hooks use these.

  Also, given that there can be multiple VMAs associated with a gntdev
  mapping, move the "mmu_interval_notifier_remove(&map->notifier)" call to
  the end of gntdev_put_map, so that the MMU notifier is only removed
  after the closing of the last remaining VMA.

  Finally, use an atomic to prevent inadvertent gntdev mapping re-use,
  instead of using the map->live_grants atomic counter and/or the map->vma
  pointer (the latter of which is now removed). This prevents the
  userspace from mmap()'ing (with MAP_FIXED) a gntdev mapping over the
  same address range as a previously set up gntdev mapping. This scenario
  can be summarized with the following call-trace, which was valid prior
  to this commit:

    mmap
      gntdev_mmap
    mmap (repeat mmap with MAP_FIXED over the same address range)
      gntdev_invalidate
        unmap_grant_pages (sets 'being_removed' entries to true)
          gnttab_unmap_refs_async
      unmap_single_vma
      gntdev_mmap (maps the shared pages again)
    munmap
      gntdev_invalidate
        unmap_grant_pages
          (no-op because 'being_removed' entries are true)
      unmap_single_vma (For PV domains, Xen reports that a granted page
        is being unmapped and triggers a general protection fault in the
        affected domain, if Xen was built with CONFIG_DEBUG)

  The fix for this last scenario could be worth its own commit, but we
  opted for a single commit, because removing the gntdev_grant_map
  structure's vma field requires guarding the entry to gntdev_mmap(), and
  the live_grants atomic counter is not sufficient on its own to prevent
  the mmap() over a pre-existing mapping.
