aliases: []
summary: engine.io-client is the client for engine.io, the implementation of a transport-based
  cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. The vulnerability
  is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized` setting. If the value
  is something that evaluates to false, certificate verification will be disabled. This is problematic
  as engine.io-client 1.6.8 and earlier passes in an object for settings that includes the rejectUnauthorized
  property, whether it has been set or not. If the value has not been explicitly changed, it
  will be passed in as `null`, resulting in certificate verification being turned off.
