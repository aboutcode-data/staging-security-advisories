  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI: endpoint: Fix PCI domain ID release in pci_epc_destroy()

  pci_epc_destroy() invokes pci_bus_release_domain_nr() to release the PCI
  domain ID, but there are two issues:

    - 'epc->dev' is passed to pci_bus_release_domain_nr() which was already
      freed by device_unregister(), leading to a use-after-free issue.

    - Domain ID corresponds to the EPC device parent, so passing 'epc->dev'
      is also wrong.

  Fix these issues by passing 'epc->dev.parent' to
  pci_bus_release_domain_nr() and also do it before device_unregister().
