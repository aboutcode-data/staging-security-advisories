aliases: []
summary: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation
  from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity
  hardware. Prior to version 1.10.11, when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, FreeSWITCH is
  susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello handshake phase of the
  DTLS protocol. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted
  calls during the attack. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with an
  invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port on the FreeSWITCH server
  that is expecting packets from the caller, a DTLS error is generated. This results in the
  media session being torn down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too.
  Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable FreeSWITCH
  servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. To address this vulnerability, upgrade FreeSWITCH
  to 1.10.11 which includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all packets
  from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.
