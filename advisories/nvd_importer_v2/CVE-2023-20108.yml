summary: "A vulnerability in the XCP Authentication Service of the Cisco Unified Communications\
  \ Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to cause a temporary service outage for all Cisco Unified CM IM&amp;P users\
  \ who are attempting to authenticate to the service, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted login message to the affected\
  \ device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of\
  \ the authentication service, preventing new users from successfully authenticating. Exploitation\
  \ of this vulnerability does not impact Cisco Unified CM IM&amp;P users who were authenticated\
  \ prior to an attack."
