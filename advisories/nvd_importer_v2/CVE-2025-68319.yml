  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  netconsole: Acquire su_mutex before navigating configs hierarchy

  There is a race between operations that iterate over the userdata
  cg_children list and concurrent add/remove of userdata items through
  configfs. The update_userdata() function iterates over the
  nt->userdata_group.cg_children list, and count_extradata_entries() also
  iterates over this same list to count nodes.

  Quoting from Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst:
  > A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and the ci_parent pointer
  > to see the tree created by the subsystem.  This can race with configfs'
  > management of the hierarchy, so configfs uses the subsystem mutex to
  > protect modifications.  Whenever a subsystem wants to navigate the
  > hierarchy, it must do so under the protection of the subsystem
  > mutex.

  Without proper locking, if a userdata item is added or removed
  concurrently while these functions are iterating, the list can be
  accessed in an inconsistent state. For example, the list_for_each() loop
  can reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()
  which sets the nodes' .next pointer to point to itself, so the loop will
  never end (or reach the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).

  Fix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex (su_mutex) during all
  operations that iterate over cg_children.
  This includes:
  - userdatum_value_store() which calls update_userdata() to iterate over
    cg_children
  - All sysdata_*_enabled_store() functions which call
    count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children

  The su_mutex must be acquired before dynamic_netconsole_mutex to avoid
  potential lock ordering issues, as configfs operations may already hold
  su_mutex when calling into our code.
