aliases: []
summary: Pixelfed is an open source photo sharing platform. When processing requests authorization
  was improperly and insufficiently checked, allowing attackers to access far more functionality
  than users intended, including to the administrative and moderator functionality of the Pixelfed
  server. This vulnerability affects every version of Pixelfed between v0.10.4 and v0.11.9,
  inclusive. A proof of concept of this vulnerability exists. This vulnerability affects every
  local user of a Pixelfed server, and can potentially affect the servers' ability to federate.
  Some user interaction is required to setup the conditions to be able to exercise the vulnerability,
  but the attacker could conduct this attack time-delayed manner, where user interaction is
  not actively required. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.11.11. Users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
