aliases: []
summary: Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. Any call with the
  query argument `?pimcore_preview=true` allows to view unpublished sites. In previous versions
  of Pimcore, session information would propagate to previews, so only a logged in user could
  open a preview. This no longer applies. Previews are broad open to any user and with just
  the hint of a restricted link one could gain access to possible confident / unreleased information.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 11.2.2 and 11.1.6.1.
