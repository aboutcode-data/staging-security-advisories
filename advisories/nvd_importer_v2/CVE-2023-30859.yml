aliases: []
summary: Triton is a Minecraft plugin for Spigot and BungeeCord that helps you translate your
  Minecraft server. The CustomPayload packet allows you to execute commands on the spigot/bukkit
  console. When you enable bungee mode in the config it will enable the bungee bridge and the
  server will begin to broadcast the 'triton:main' plugin channel. Using this plugin channel
  you are able to send a payload packet containing a byte (2) and a string (any spigot command).
  This could be used to make yourself a server operator and be used to extract other user information
  through phishing (pretending to be an admin), many servers use essentials so the /geoip command
  could be available to them, etc. This could also be modified to allow you to set the servers
  language, set another players language, etc. This issue affects those who have bungee enabled
  in config. This issue has been fixed in version 3.8.4.
