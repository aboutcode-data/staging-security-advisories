summary: The archive-tainacan-collection theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in version

  in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
