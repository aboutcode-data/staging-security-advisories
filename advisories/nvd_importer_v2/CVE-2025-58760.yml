aliases: []
summary: Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. The
  `/image` API endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing
  unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server's filesystem.
  In Tautulli, the `/image` API endpoint is used to serve static images from the application's
  data directory to users. This endpoint can be accessed without authentication, and its intended
  purpose is for server background images and icons within the user interface. Attackers can
  exfiltrate files from the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database
  containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin
  password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If
  the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated
  attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application.
  Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue.
