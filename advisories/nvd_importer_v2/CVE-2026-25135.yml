aliases: []
summary: OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management
  application. Versions prior to 8.0.0 have an information disclosure vulnerability that leaks
  the entire contact information for all users, organizations, and patients in the system to
  anyone who has the system/(Group,Patient,*).$export operation and system/Location.read capabilities.  This
  vulnerability will impact OpenEMR versions since 2023. This disclosure will only occur in
  extremely high trust environments as it requires using a confidential client with secure key
  exchange that requires an administrator to enable and grant permission before the app can
  even be used. This will typically only occur in server-server communication across trusted
  clients that already have established legal agreements. Version 8.0.0 contains a patch. As
  a workaround, disable clients that have the vulnerable scopes and only allow clients that
  do not have the system/Location.read scope until a fix has been deployed.
