summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts. A chart archive file can be crafted in a manner
  where it expands to be significantly larger uncompressed than compressed (e.g., >800x difference).
  When Helm loads this specially crafted chart, memory can be exhausted causing the application
  to terminate. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.17.3.
