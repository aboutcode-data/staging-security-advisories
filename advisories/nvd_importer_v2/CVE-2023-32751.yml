aliases: []
summary: Pydio Cells through 4.1.2 allows XSS. Pydio Cells implements the download of files
  using presigned URLs which are generated using the Amazon AWS SDK for JavaScript [1]. The
  secrets used to sign these URLs are hardcoded and exposed through the JavaScript files of
  the web application. Therefore, it is possible to generate valid signatures for arbitrary
  download URLs. By uploading an HTML file and modifying the download URL to serve the file
  inline instead of as an attachment, any included JavaScript code is executed when the URL
  is opened in a browser, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
