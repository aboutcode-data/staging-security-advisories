aliases: []
summary: KubePi is a K8s panel. Starting in version 1.6.3 and prior to version 1.8.0, there
  is a defect in the KubePi JWT token verification. The JWT key in the default configuration
  file is empty. Although a random 32-bit string will be generated to overwrite the key in the
  configuration file when the key is detected to be empty in the configuration file reading
  logic, the key is empty during actual verification. Using an empty key to generate a JWT token
  can bypass the login verification and directly take over the back end. Version 1.8.0 contains
  a patch for this issue.
