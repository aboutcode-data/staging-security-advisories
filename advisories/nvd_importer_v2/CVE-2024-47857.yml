summary: SSH Communication Security PrivX versions between 18.0-36.0 implement insufficient
  validation on public key signatures when using native SSH connections via a proxy port. This
  allows an existing PrivX "account A" to impersonate another existing PrivX "account B" and
  gain access to SSH target hosts to which the "account B" has access.
