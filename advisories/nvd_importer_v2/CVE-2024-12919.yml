summary: The Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content
  Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.13.7. This is due to the pms_pb_payment_redirect_link function using
  the user-controlled value supplied via the 'pms_payment_id' parameter to authenticate users
  without any further identity validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  with knowledge of a valid payment ID to log in as any user who has made a purchase on the
  targeted site.
