aliases: []
summary: 'containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon
  for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim
  API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API socket
  verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict
  access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in
  the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges,
  to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed
  in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released.
  It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be
  stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an
  upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the
  same network namespace as the shim (typically the "host" network namespace, for example with
  docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective
  UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable
  configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line
  similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with
  a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd
  maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of
  isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container''s privilege,
  regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.'
