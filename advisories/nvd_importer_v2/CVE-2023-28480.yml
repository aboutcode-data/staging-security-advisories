aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. The TigerGraph platform allows
  users to define new User Defined Functions (UDFs) from C/C++ code. To support this functionality
  TigerGraph allows users to upload custom C/C++ code which is then compiled and installed into
  the platform. An attacker who has filesystem access on a remote TigerGraph system can alter
  the behavior of the database against the will of the database administrator; thus effectively
  bypassing the built in RBAC controls.
