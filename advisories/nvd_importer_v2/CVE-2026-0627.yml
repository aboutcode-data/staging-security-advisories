aliases: []
summary: The AMP for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  SVG file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.10. This is due to insufficient
  sanitization of SVG file content that only removes `<script>` tags while allowing other XSS
  vectors such as event handlers (onload, onerror, onmouseover), foreignObject elements, and
  SVG animation attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts via malicious SVG file uploads that will
  execute whenever a user views the uploaded file.
