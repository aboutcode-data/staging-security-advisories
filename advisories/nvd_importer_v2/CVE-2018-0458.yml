summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration
  Assurance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management
  interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface
  to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
