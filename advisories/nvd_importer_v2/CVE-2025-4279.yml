aliases: []
summary: The External image replace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'external_image_replace_get_posts::replace_post'
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the
  affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
