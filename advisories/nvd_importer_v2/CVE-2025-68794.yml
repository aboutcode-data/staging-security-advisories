  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iomap: adjust read range correctly for non-block-aligned positions

  iomap_adjust_read_range() assumes that the position and length passed in
  are block-aligned. This is not always the case however, as shown in the
  syzbot generated case for erofs. This causes too many bytes to be
  skipped for uptodate blocks, which results in returning the incorrect
  position and length to read in. If all the blocks are uptodate, this
  underflows length and returns a position beyond the folio.

  Fix the calculation to also take into account the block offset when
  calculating how many bytes can be skipped for uptodate blocks.
