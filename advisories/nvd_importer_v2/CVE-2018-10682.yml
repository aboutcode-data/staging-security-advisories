aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in WildFly 10.1.2.Final. It is possible for an attacker to
  access the administration panel on TCP port 9990 without any authentication using "anonymous"
  access that is automatically created. Once logged in, a misconfiguration present by default
  (auto-deployment) permits an anonymous user to deploy a malicious .war file, leading to remote
  code execution. NOTE: the vendor indicates that anonymous access is not available in the default
  installation; however, it remains optional because there are several use cases for it, including
  development environments and network architectures that have a proxy server for access control
  to the WildFly server'
