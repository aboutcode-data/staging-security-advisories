summary: "A vulnerability in the single sign-on (SSO) implementation of Cisco BroadWorks Application\
  \ Delivery Platform and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to forge the credentials required to access an affected system.\r\n\r This\
  \ vulnerability is due to the method used to validate SSO tokens. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by authenticating to the application with forged credentials. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to commit toll fraud or to execute commands at the privilege\
  \ level of the forged account. If that account is an Administrator account, the attacker would\
  \ have the ability to view confidential information, modify customer settings, or modify settings\
  \ for other users. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need a valid user ID\
  \ that is associated with an affected Cisco BroadWorks system."
