  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating

  Access to the GHCB is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the
  GHCB will be mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB
  might not be mapped.

  The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update the GHCB to inform
  the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a SIPI has been delivered.
  However, if a SIPI is performed without a corresponding AP Reset Hold,
  then the GHCB might not be mapped (depending on the previous VMEXIT),
  which will result in a NULL pointer dereference.

  The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will update the GHCB to inform
  the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about any errors. While it is likely
  that the GHCB will be mapped in this situation, add a safe guard
  in this path to be certain a NULL pointer dereference is not encountered.
