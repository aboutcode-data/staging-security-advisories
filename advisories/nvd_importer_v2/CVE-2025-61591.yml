aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7 and below, when
  MCP uses OAuth authentication with an untrusted MCP server, an attacker can impersonate a
  malicious MCP server and return crafted, maliciously injected commands during the interaction
  process, leading to command injection and potential remote code execution. If chained with
  an untrusted MCP service via OAuth, this command injection vulnerability could allow arbitrary
  code execution on the host by the agent. This can then be used to directly compromise the
  system by executing malicious commands with full user privileges. This issue does not currently
  have a fixed release version, but there is a patch, 2025.09.17-25b418f.
