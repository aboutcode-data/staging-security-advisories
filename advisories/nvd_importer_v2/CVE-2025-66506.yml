aliases: []
summary: Fulcio is a free-to-use certificate authority for issuing code signing certificates
  for an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity. Prior to 1.8.3, function identity.extractIssuerURL
  splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As
  a result, in the face of a malicious request with an (invalid) OIDC identity token in the
  payload containing many period characters, a call to extractIssuerURL incurs allocations to
  the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a
  constant factor of about 16. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.3.
