aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in the ilab model serve component, where improper handling
  of the best_of parameter in the vllm JSON web API can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). The
  API used for LLM-based sentence or chat completion accepts a best_of parameter to return the
  best completion from several options. When this parameter is set to a large value, the API
  does not handle timeouts or resource exhaustion properly, allowing an attacker to cause a
  DoS by consuming excessive system resources. This leads to the API becoming unresponsive,
  preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
