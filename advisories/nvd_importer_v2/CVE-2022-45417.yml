summary: Service Workers did not detect Private Browsing Mode correctly in all cases, which
  could have led to Service Workers being written to disk for websites visited in Private Browsing
  Mode. This would not have persisted them in a state where they would run again, but it would
  have leaked Private Browsing Mode details to disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 107.
