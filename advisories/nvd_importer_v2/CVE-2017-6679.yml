aliases: []
summary: The Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Version 2.0.3 and prior contained an undocumented
  encrypted remote support tunnel (SSH) which auto initiated from the customer's appliance to
  Cisco's SSH Hubs in the Umbrella datacenters. These tunnels were primarily leveraged for remote
  support and allowed for authorized/authenticated personnel from the Cisco Umbrella team to
  access the appliance remotely and obtain full control without explicit customer approval.
  To address this vulnerability, the Umbrella Virtual Appliance version 2.1.0 now requires explicit
  customer approval before an SSH tunnel from the VA to the Cisco terminating server can be
  established.
