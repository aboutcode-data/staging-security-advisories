aliases: []
summary: In BookStack greater than or equal to 0.18.0 and less than 0.29.2, there is an XSS
  vulnerability in comment creation. A user with permission to create comments could POST HTML
  directly to the system to be saved in a comment, which would then be executed/displayed to
  others users viewing the comment. Through this vulnerability custom JavaScript code could
  be injected and therefore ran on other user machines. This most impacts scenarios where not-trusted
  users are given permission to create comments. This has been fixed in 0.29.2.
