summary: 'Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user''s
  configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided
  by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in
  weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulnerable to a brute
  force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects: Apache
  OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13. Reference: CVE-2022-26307 - LibreOffice'
