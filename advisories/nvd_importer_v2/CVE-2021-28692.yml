aliases: []
summary: 'inappropriate x86 IOMMU timeout detection / handling IOMMUs process commands issued
  to them in parallel with the operation of the CPU(s) issuing such commands. In the current
  implementation in Xen, asynchronous notification of the completion of such commands is not
  used. Instead, the issuing CPU spin-waits for the completion of the most recently issued command(s).
  Some of these waiting loops try to apply a timeout to fail overly-slow commands. The course
  of action upon a perceived timeout actually being detected is inappropriate: - on Intel hardware
  guests which did not originally cause the timeout may be marked as crashed, - on AMD hardware
  higher layer callers would not be notified of the issue, making them continue as if the IOMMU
  operation succeeded.'
