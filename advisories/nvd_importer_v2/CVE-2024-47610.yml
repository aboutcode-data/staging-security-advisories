aliases: []
summary: 'InvenTree is an Open Source Inventory Management System. In affected versions of InvenTree
  it is possible for a registered user to store javascript in markdown notes fields, which are
  then displayed to other logged in users who visit the same page and executed. The vulnerability
  has been addressed as follows: 1. HTML sanitization has been enabled in the front-end markdown
  rendering library - `easymde`. 2. Stored markdown is also validated on the backend, to ensure
  that malicious markdown is not stored in the database. These changes are available in release
  versions 0.16.5 and later. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds, an
  update is required to get the new validation functions.'
