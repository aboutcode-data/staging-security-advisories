aliases: []
summary: TiDB is an open-source NewSQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical
  Processing (HTAP) workloads. Under certain conditions, an attacker can construct malicious
  authentication requests to bypass the authentication process, resulting in privilege escalation
  or unauthorized access. Only users using TiDB 5.3.0 are affected by this vulnerability. TiDB
  version 5.3.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other mitigation strategies include turning
  off Security Enhanced Mode (SEM), disabling local login for non-root accounts, and ensuring
  that the same IP cannot be logged in as root and normal user at the same time.
