aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the TACACS+ client subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS
  XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to
  reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper
  handling of crafted TACACS+ response packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by injecting a crafted TACACS+ packet into an existing TACACS+ session
  between an affected device and a TACACS+ server or by impersonating a known, valid TACACS+
  server and sending a crafted TACACS+ packet to an affected device when establishing a connection
  to the device. To exploit this vulnerability by using either method, the attacker must know
  the shared TACACS+ secret and the crafted packet must be sent in response to a TACACS+ request
  from a TACACS+ client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected
  device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
