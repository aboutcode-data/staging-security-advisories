aliases: []
summary: kotaemon is an open-source RAG-based tool for document comprehension. From versions
  0.10.6 and prior, in libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/ui.py, the index_fn method accepts both URLs
  and local file paths without validation. The pipeline streams these paths directly and stores
  them, enabling attackers to traverse directories (e.g. ../../../../../.env) and exfiltrate
  sensitive files. This issue has been patched via commit 37cdc28, in version 0.10.7 which has
  not been made public at time of publication.
