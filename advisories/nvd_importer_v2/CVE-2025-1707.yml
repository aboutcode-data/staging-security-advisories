aliases: []
summary: The Review Schema plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.2.4 via post meta. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary
  files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used
  to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where
  php file type can be uploaded and included.
