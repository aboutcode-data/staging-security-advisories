aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically
  within the artifact deletion functionality. Attackers can bypass path validation by exploiting
  the double decoding process in the `_delete_artifact_mlflow_artifacts` handler and `local_file_uri_to_path`
  function, allowing for the deletion of arbitrary directories on the server's filesystem. This
  vulnerability is due to an extra unquote operation in the `delete_artifacts` function of `local_artifact_repo.py`,
  which fails to properly sanitize user-supplied paths. The issue is present up to version 2.9.2,
  despite attempts to fix a similar issue in CVE-2023-6831.
