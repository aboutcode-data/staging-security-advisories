aliases: []
summary: A Out-of-bounds Write issue affecting the v2_sdk_service running on a set of DJI drone
  devices on the port 10000 could allow an attacker to overwrite a pointer in the process memory
  through a crafted payload triggering an unsafe memory write operation in the my_tcp_receive
  function implemented in the libv2_sdk.so library used by the dji_vtwo_sdk binary implementing
  the service, potentially leading to a memory information leak or to an arbitrary code execution.
  Affected models are Mavic 3 Pro until v01.01.0300, Mavic 3 until v01.00.1200, Mavic 3 Classic
  until v01.00.0500, Mavic 3 Enterprise until v07.01.10.03, Matrice 300 until v57.00.01.00,
