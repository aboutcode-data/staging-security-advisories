aliases: []
summary: The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_public' function in
  versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete or change plugin settings, import demo data, delete Directory Kit related posts
  and terms, and install arbitrary plugins. A partial patch was introduced in version 1.2.0
  and an additional partial patch was introduced in version 1.2.2, but the issue was not fully
  patched until 1.2.3.
