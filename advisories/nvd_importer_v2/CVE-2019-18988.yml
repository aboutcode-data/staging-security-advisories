aliases: []
summary: TeamViewer Desktop through 14.7.1965 allows a bypass of remote-login access control
  because the same key is used for different customers' installations. It used a shared AES
  key for all installations since at least as far back as v7.0.43148, and used it for at least
  OptionsPasswordAES in the current version of the product. If an attacker were to know this
  key, they could decrypt protect information stored in the registry or configuration files
  of TeamViewer. With versions before v9.x , this allowed for attackers to decrypt the Unattended
  Access password to the system (which allows for remote login to the system as well as headless
  file browsing). The latest version still uses the same key for OptionPasswordAES but appears
  to have changed how the Unattended Access password is stored. While in most cases an attacker
  requires an existing session on a system, if the registry/configuration keys were stored off
  of the machine (such as in a file share or online), an attacker could then decrypt the required
  password to login to the system.
