summary: The RumbleTalk Live Group Chat – HTML5 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'rumbletalk-admin-button' shortcode in all versions
  up to, and including, 6.3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on
  user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level

  accesses an injected page.
