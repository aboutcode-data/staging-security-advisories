summary: Tacquito prior to commit 07b49d1358e6ec0b5aa482fcd284f509191119e2 was not properly
  performing regex matches on authorized commands and arguments. Configured allowed commands/arguments
  were intended to require a match on the entire string, but instead only enforced a match on
  a sub-string. That would have potentially allowed unauthorized commands to be executed.
