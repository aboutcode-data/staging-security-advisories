aliases: []
summary: Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information
  Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a large
  HTTP content type, when logged can cause a stack overflow crashing Suricata. This issue has
  been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves limiting stream.reassembly.depth
  to less then half the stack size. Increasing the process stack size makes it less likely the
  bug will trigger.
