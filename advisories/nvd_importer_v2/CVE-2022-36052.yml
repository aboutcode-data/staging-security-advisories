aliases: []
summary: Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT
  devices. The 6LoWPAN implementation in Contiki-NG may cast a UDP header structure at a certain
  offset in a packet buffer. The code does not check whether the packet buffer is large enough
  to fit a full UDP header structure from the offset where the casting is made. Hence, it is
  possible to cause an out-of-bounds read beyond the packet buffer. The problem affects anyone
  running devices with Contiki-NG versions previous to 4.8, and which may receive 6LoWPAN packets
  from external parties. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG version 4.8.
