summary: The AAWP Obfuscator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'data-aawp-web' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page.
