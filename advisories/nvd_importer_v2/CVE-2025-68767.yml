  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk

  syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when
  the S_IFMT bits of the 16bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted.

  According to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS
  8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized
  with 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when
  the "mode" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be
  S_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/
  S_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir == 0.
