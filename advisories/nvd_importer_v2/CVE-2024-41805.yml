aliases: []
summary: Tracks, a Getting Things Done (GTD) web application, is vulnerable to reflected cross-site
  scripting in versions prior to 2.7.1. Reflected cross-site scripting enables execution of
  malicious JavaScript in the context of a user’s browser if that user clicks on a malicious
  link, allowing phishing attacks that could lead to credential theft. Tracks version 2.7.1
  is patched. No known complete workarounds are available.
