summary: The myCred – Points Management System For Gamification, Ranks, Badges, and Loyalty
  Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and
  including, 2.9.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized
  to perform an action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve withdrawal
  requests, modify user point balances, and manipulate the payment processing system via the
  cashcred_pay_now AJAX action.
