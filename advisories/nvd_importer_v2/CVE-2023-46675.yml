aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in
  Kibana logs in the event of an error or in the event where debug level logging is enabled
  in Kibana. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.2 which resolves this issue. The messages recorded
  in the log may contain Account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials
  of Kibana end-users, Elastic Security package policy objects which can contain private keys,
  bearer token, and sessions of 3rd-party integrations and finally Authorization headers, client
  secrets, local file paths, and stack traces. The issue may occur in any Kibana instance running
  an affected version that could potentially receive an unexpected error when communicating
  to Elasticsearch causing it to include sensitive data into Kibana error logs. It could also
  occur under specific circumstances when debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Note: It
  was found that the fix for ESA-2023-25 in Kibana 8.11.1 for a similar issue was incomplete.'
