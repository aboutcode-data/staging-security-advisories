aliases: []
summary: The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Instantiation
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.3 via module parameter. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to Instantiate a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the
  vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or
  theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional
  plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions
  like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP
  chain present.
