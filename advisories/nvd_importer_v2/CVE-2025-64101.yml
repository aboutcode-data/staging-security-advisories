aliases: []
summary: Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and
  2.71.18, a potential vulnerability exists in ZITADEL's password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes
  the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the
  password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to
  the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they
  could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled
  by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code
  embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used
  to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. It's important
  to note that this specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor
  Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This vulnerability is fixed in
  4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18.
