aliases: []
summary: The Contact Form Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's [xyz-cfm-form] shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.1 due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
