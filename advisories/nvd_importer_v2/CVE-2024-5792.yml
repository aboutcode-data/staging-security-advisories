aliases: []
summary: The Houzez CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the
  notes ‘belong_to’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2 due to insufficient
  escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing
  SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level (seller)
  access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can
  be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
