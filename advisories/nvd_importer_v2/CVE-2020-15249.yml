summary: October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework.
  In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, backend users with access
  to upload files were permitted to upload SVG files without any sanitization applied to the
  uploaded files. Since SVG files support being parsed as HTML by browsers, this means that
  they could theoretically upload Javascript that would be executed on a path under the website's
  domain (i.e. /storage/app/media/evil.svg), but they would have to convince their target to
  visit that location directly in the target's browser as the backend does not display SVGs
  inline anywhere, SVGs are only displayed as image resources in the backend and are thus unable
  to be executed. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) & v1.1.0.
