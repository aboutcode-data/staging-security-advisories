aliases: []
summary: The weMail - Email Marketing, Lead Generation, Optin Forms, Email Newsletters, A/B
  Testing, and Automation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized form deletion in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This is due to the `Forms::permission()` callback
  only validating the `X-WP-Nonce` header without checking user capabilities. Since the REST
  nonce is exposed to unauthenticated visitors via the `weMail` JavaScript object on pages with
  weMail forms, any unauthenticated user can permanently delete all weMail forms by extracting
  the nonce from the page source and sending a DELETE request to the forms endpoint.
