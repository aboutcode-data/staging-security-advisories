aliases: []
summary: Okta Java Management SDK facilitates interactions with the Okta management API. In
  versions 21.0.0 through 24.0.0, specific multithreaded implementations may encounter memory
  issues as threads are not properly cleaned up after requests are completed. Over time, this
  can degrade performance and availability in long-running applications and may result in a
  denial-of-service condition under sustained load. In addition to using the affected versions,
  users may be at risk if they are implementing a long-running application using the ApiClient
  in a multi-threaded manner. This issue is fixed in version 24.0.1.
