aliases: []
summary: 'fprintd through 1.94.3 lacks a security attention mechanism, and thus unexpected actions
  might be authorized by "auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so" for Sudo. NOTE: the supplier disputes
  this because they believe issue resolution would involve modifying the PAM configuration to
  restrict pam_fprintd.so to front-ends that implement a proper attention mechanism, not modifying
  pam_fprintd.so or fprintd.'
