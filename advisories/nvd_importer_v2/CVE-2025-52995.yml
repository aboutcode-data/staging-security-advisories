aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.10, the
  implementation of the allowlist is erroneous, allowing a user to execute more shell commands
  than they are authorized for. The concrete impact of this vulnerability depends on the commands
  configured, and the binaries installed on the server or in the container image. Due to the
  missing separation of scopes on the OS-level, this could give an attacker access to all files
  managed the application, including the File Browser database. This issue has been patched
  in version 2.33.10.
