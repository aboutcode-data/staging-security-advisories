aliases: []
summary: The Leopard - WordPress Offload Media plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check
  on the import_settings() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update
  arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role
  for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative
  user access to a vulnerable site.
