aliases: []
summary: Kyocera Device Manager before 3.1.1213.0 allows NTLM credential exposure during UNC
  path authentication via a crafted change from a local path to a UNC path. It allows administrators
  to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change
  this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \ (backslash) character,
  which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request
  via a proxy, or sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC paths
  to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set, Kyocera Device Manager attempts
  to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration
  of the environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could
  allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.
