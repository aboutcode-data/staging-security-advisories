aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Keeper Password Manager for Desktop version 16.10.2 (fixed
  in 17.2), and the KeeperFill Browser Extensions version 16.5.4 (fixed in 17.2), allows local
  attackers to gain sensitive information via plaintext password storage in memory after the
  user is already logged in, and may persist after logout. NOTE: the vendor disputes this for
  two reasons: the information is inherently available during a logged-in session when the attacker
  can read from arbitrary memory locations, and information only remains available after logout
  because of memory-management limitations of web browsers (not because the Keeper technology
  itself is retaining the information).'
