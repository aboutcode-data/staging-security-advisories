aliases: []
summary: DataChain is a Python-based AI-data warehouse for transforming and analyzing unstructured
  data. Versions 0.34.1 and below allow for deseriaization of untrusted data because of the
  way the DataChain library reads serialized objects from environment variables (such as DATACHAIN__METASTORE
  and DATACHAIN__WAREHOUSE) in the loader.py module. An attacker with the ability to set these
  environment variables can trigger code execution when the application loads. This issue is
  fixed in version 0.34.2.
