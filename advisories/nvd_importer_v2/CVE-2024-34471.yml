aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in HSC Mailinspector 5.2.17-3. A Path Traversal vulnerability
  (resulting in file deletion) exists in the mliRealtimeEmails.php file. The filename parameter
  in the export HTML functionality does not properly validate the file location, allowing an
  attacker to read and delete arbitrary files on the server. This was observed when the mliRealtimeEmails.php
  file itself was read and subsequently deleted, resulting in a 404 error for the file and disruption
  of email information loading.
