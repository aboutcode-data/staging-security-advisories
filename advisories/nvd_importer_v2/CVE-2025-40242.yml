  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gfs2: Fix unlikely race in gdlm_put_lock

  In gdlm_put_lock(), there is a small window of time in which the
  DFL_UNMOUNT flag has been set but the lockspace hasn't been released,
  yet.  In that window, dlm may still call gdlm_ast() and gdlm_bast().
  To prevent it from dereferencing freed glock objects, only free the
  glock if the lockspace has actually been released.
