aliases: []
summary: pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming
  the pages of PDF files. In version 2.10.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft
  a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can
  utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example,
  the case if the user extracted metadata from such a malformed PDF. Versions prior to 2.10.5
  throw an error, but do not hang forever. This issue was fixed with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1331
  which has been included in release 2.10.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
  should modify `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py::read_object` to an an error throwing case.
  See GHSA-hm9v-vj3r-r55m for details.
