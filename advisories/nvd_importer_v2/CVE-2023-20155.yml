aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in a logging API in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to become unresponsive
  or trigger an unexpected reload. This vulnerability could also allow an attacker with valid
  user credentials, but not Administrator privileges, to view a system log file that they would
  not normally have access to. This vulnerability is due to a lack of rate-limiting of requests
  that are sent to a specific API that is related to an FMC log. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending a high rate of HTTP requests to the API. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the FMC CPU spiking
  to 100 percent utilization or to the device reloading. CPU utilization would return to normal
  if the attack traffic was stopped before an unexpected reload was triggered.
