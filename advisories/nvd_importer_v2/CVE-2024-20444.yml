summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC), formerly Cisco\
  \ Data Center Network Manager (DCNM), could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with network-admin\
  \ privileges to perform a command injection attack against an affected device.\r\n&nbsp;\r\
  \nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of command arguments. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted command arguments to a specific REST API\
  \ endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite sensitive files or\
  \ crash a specific container, which would restart on its own, causing a low-impact denial\
  \ of service (DoS) condition."
