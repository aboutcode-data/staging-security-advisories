aliases: []
summary: 'Unspecified vulnerability in main.php in an unspecified "file created by Andries Bruinsma,"
  possibly a FleXiBle Development (FXB) application, allows remote attackers to include and
  execute arbitrary PHP code.  NOTE: this disclosure is extremely vague and has very little
  information about the specific vulnerability type.  In addition, there is little public information
  on the named product. Finally, an XSS vector is implied in the subject line, but because there
  is no other information and evidence of a cut-and-paste error, it will not be assigned a separate
  CVE identifier unless additional information is provided.'
