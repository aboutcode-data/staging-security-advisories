aliases: []
summary: The Crypto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 2.15. This is due to missing validation on the user being supplied in
  the 'crypto_connect_ajax_process::register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have
  access to the username.
