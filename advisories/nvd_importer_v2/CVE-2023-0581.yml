aliases: []
summary: The PrivateContent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to protection mechanism bypass
  due to the use of client side validation in versions up to, and including, 8.4.3. This is
  due to the plugin checking if an IP had been blocklist via client-side scripts rather than
  server-side. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any login restrictions  that
  may prevent a brute force attack.
