aliases: []
summary: Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane.
  Prior to version 1.13.4, when Gateway API is enabled in Cilium, the absence of a check on
  the namespace in which a ReferenceGrant is created could result in Cilium unintentionally
  gaining visibility of secrets (including certificates) and services across namespaces. An
  attacker on an affected cluster can leverage this issue to use cluster secrets that should
  not be visible to them, or communicate with services that they should not have access to.
  Gateway API functionality is disabled by default. This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium release
  1.13.4. As a workaround, restrict the creation of `ReferenceGrant` resources to admin users
  by using Kubernetes RBAC.
