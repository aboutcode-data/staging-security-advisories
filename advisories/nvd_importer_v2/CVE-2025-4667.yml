summary: The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's ssa_admin_upcoming_appointments,
  ssa_admin_upcoming_appointments, and ssa_past_appointments shortcodes in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.6.8.30 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
  supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
