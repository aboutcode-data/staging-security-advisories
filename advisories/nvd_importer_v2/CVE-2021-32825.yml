aliases: []
summary: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before
  commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a "zipslip" vulnerability. The unsafe
  handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write
  to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary
  file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker
  can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked
  files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to
  read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.
