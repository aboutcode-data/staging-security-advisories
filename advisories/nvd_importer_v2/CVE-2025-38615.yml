  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs/ntfs3: cancle set bad inode after removing name fails

  The reproducer uses a file0 on a ntfs3 file system with a corrupted i_link.
  When renaming, the file0's inode is marked as a bad inode because the file
  name cannot be deleted.

  The underlying bug is that make_bad_inode() is called on a live inode.
  In some cases it's "icache lookup finds a normal inode, d_splice_alias()
  is called to attach it to dentry, while another thread decides to call
  make_bad_inode() on it - that would evict it from icache, but we'd already
  found it there earlier".
  In some it's outright "we have an inode attached to dentry - that's how we
  got it in the first place; let's call make_bad_inode() on it just for shits
  and giggles".
