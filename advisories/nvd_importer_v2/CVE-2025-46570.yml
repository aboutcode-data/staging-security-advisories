aliases: []
summary: vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). Prior to
  version 0.9.0, when a new prompt is processed, if the PageAttention mechanism finds a matching
  prefix chunk, the prefill process speeds up, which is reflected in the TTFT (Time to First
  Token). These timing differences caused by matching chunks are significant enough to be recognized
  and exploited. This issue has been patched in version 0.9.0.
