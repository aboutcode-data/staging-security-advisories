aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.5, an information disclosure vulnerability
  exists due to the inclusion of single-use tokens in the responses of `GET /v1/users/me` and
  `GET /v1/users/me/org` API endpoints. These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such
  as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially
  allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version
  1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated.
