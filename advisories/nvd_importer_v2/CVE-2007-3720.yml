aliases: []
summary: The process scheduler in the Linux kernel 2.4 performs scheduling based on CPU billing
  gathered from periodic process sampling ticks, which allows local users to cause a denial
  of service (CPU consumption) by performing voluntary nanosecond sleeps that result in the
  process not being active during a clock interrupt, as described in "Secretly Monopolizing
  the CPU Without Superuser Privileges."
