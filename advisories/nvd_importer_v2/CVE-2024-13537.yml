summary: The C9 Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.7.7. This is due the plugin containing a publicly accessible composer-setup.php
  file with error display enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve
  the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information
  displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage
  to an affected website.
