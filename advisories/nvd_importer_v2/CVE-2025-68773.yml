  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: fsl-cpm: Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode

  Commit fc96ec826bce ("spi: fsl-cpm: Use 16 bit mode for large transfers
  with even size") failed to make sure that the size is really even
  before switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went
  unnoticed because kernfs uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size
  PAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.

  But commit 8ad6249c51d0 ("eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem API")
  introduced an additional dynamically allocated bounce buffer whose size
  is exactly the size of the transfer, leading to a buffer overrun in
  the fsl-cpm driver when that size is odd.

  Add the missing length parity verification and remain in 8 bit mode
  when the length is not even.
