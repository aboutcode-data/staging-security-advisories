aliases: []
summary: 'In IoTivity through 1.3.1, the CoAP server interface can be used for Distributed Denial
  of Service attacks using source IP address spoofing and UDP-based traffic amplification. The
  reflected traffic is 6 times bigger than spoofed requests. This occurs because the construction
  of a "4.01 Unauthorized" response is mishandled. NOTE: the vendor states "While this is an
  interesting attack, there is no plan for maintainer to fix, as we are migrating to IoTivity
  Lite."'
