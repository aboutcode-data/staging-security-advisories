aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in SecurEnvoy SecurAccess 9.3.502. When put in Debug mode
  and used for RDP connections, the application stores the emergency credentials in cleartext
  in the logs (present in the DEBUG folder) that can be accessed by anyone. NOTE: The vendor
  disputes this as a vulnerability since the disclosure of a local account password (actually
  an alpha numeric passcode) is achievable only when a custom registry key is added to the windows
  registry. This action requires administrator access and the registry key is only provided
  by support staff at securenvoy to troubleshoot customer issues.'
