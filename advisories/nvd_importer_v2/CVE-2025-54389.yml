aliases: []
summary: AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. Prior to version 0.19.2, there
  is an improper output neutralization vulnerability in AIDE.  An attacker can craft a malicious
  filename by including terminal escape sequences to hide the addition or removal of the file
  from the report and/or tamper with the log output. A local user might exploit this to bypass
  the AIDE detection of malicious files. Additionally the output of extended attribute key names
  and symbolic links targets are also not properly neutralized. This issue has been patched
  in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves configuring AIDE to write the report output to a
  regular file, redirecting stdout to a regular file, or redirecting the log output written
  to stderr to a regular file.
