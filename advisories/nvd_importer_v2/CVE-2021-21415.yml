aliases: []
summary: Prisma VS Code a VSCode extension for Prisma schema files. This is a Remote Code Execution
  Vulnerability that affects all versions of the Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0.
  If a custom binary path for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example
  by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that sets a value for "prismaFmtBinPath".
  That custom binary is executed when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation
  checks are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in versions 2.20.0 and
  20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file
  or check if the binary is malicious and delete it.
