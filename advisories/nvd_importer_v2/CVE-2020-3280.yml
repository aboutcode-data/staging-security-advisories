summary: A vulnerability in the Java Remote Management Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center
  Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary
  code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied
  content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected
  device.
