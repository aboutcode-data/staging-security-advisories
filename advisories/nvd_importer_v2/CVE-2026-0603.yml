aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Hibernate. A remote attacker with low privileges could exploit
  a second-order SQL injection vulnerability by providing specially crafted, unsanitized non-alphanumeric
  characters in the ID column when the InlineIdsOrClauseBuilder is used. This could lead to
  sensitive information disclosure, such as reading system files, and allow for data manipulation
  or deletion within the application's database, resulting in an application level denial of
  service.
