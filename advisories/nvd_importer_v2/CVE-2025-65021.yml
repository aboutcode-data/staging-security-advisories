aliases: []
summary: Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Prior to version 4.5.4,
  an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the poll finalization feature
  of the application. Any authenticated user can finalize a poll they do not own by manipulating
  the pollId parameter in the request. This allows unauthorized users to finalize other users’
  polls and convert them into events without proper authorization checks, potentially disrupting
  user workflows and causing data integrity and availability issues. This issue has been patched
  in version 4.5.4.
