aliases: []
summary: The RestroPress – Online Food Ordering System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Authentication Bypass in versions 3.0.0 to 3.1.9.2. This is due to the plugin exposing user
  private tokens and API data via the /wp-json/wp/v2/users REST API endpoint. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to forge JWT tokens for other users, including administrators,
  and authenticate as them.
