aliases: []
summary: Opencast is an Open Source Lecture Capture & Video Management for Education. Opencast
  before version 9.10 or 10.6 allows references to local file URLs in ingested media packages,
  allowing attackers to include local files from Opencast's host machines and making them available
  via the web interface. Before Opencast 9.10 and 10.6, Opencast would open and include local
  files during ingests. Attackers could exploit this to include most local files the process
  has read access to, extracting secrets from the host machine. An attacker would need to have
  the privileges required to add new media to exploit this. But these are often widely given.
  The issue has been fixed in Opencast 10.6 and 11.0. You can mitigate this issue by narrowing
  down the read access Opencast has to files on the file system using UNIX permissions or mandatory
  access control systems like SELinux. This cannot prevent access to files Opencast needs to
  read though and we highly recommend updating.
