aliases: []
summary: Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. In versions 10.9.0 to before 10.10.7,
  the /System/Restart endpoint provides administrators the ability to restart their Jellyfin
  server. This endpoint is intended to be admins-only, but it also authorizes requests from
  any device in the same local network as the Jellyfin server. Due to the method Jellyfin uses
  to determine the source IP of a request, an unauthenticated attacker is able to spoof their
  IP to appear as a LAN IP, allowing them to restart the Jellyfin server process without authentication.
  This means that an unauthenticated attacker could mount a denial-of-service attack on any
  default-configured Jellyfin server by simply sending the same spoofed request every few seconds
  to restart the server over and over. This method of IP spoofing also bypasses some security
  mechanisms, cause a denial-of-service attack, and possible bypass the admin restart requirement
  if combined with remote code execution. This issue is patched in version 10.10.7.
