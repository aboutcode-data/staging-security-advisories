  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  comedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()

  Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from
  the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),
  subdevice dev->read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to
  &struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of
  &s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.

  Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from
  pcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its
  support for async commands, everything async-related will be
  handled via subdevice's own ->cancel() function in
  comedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no
  support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need
  to cancel anything either.
