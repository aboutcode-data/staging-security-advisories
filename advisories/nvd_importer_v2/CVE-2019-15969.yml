aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Web Security Appliance
  (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to
  insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an
  affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the
  interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary script or HTML code in the context of the interface, which could allow the attacker
  to gain access to sensitive, browser-based information.
