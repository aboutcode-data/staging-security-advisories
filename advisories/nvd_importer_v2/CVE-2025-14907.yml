summary: The Moderate Selected Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing nonce verification
  on the msp_admin_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
