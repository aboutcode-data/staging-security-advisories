  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/damon/sysfs: catch commit test ctx alloc failure

  Patch series "mm/damon/sysfs: fix commit test damon_ctx [de]allocation".

  DAMON sysfs interface dynamically allocates and uses a damon_ctx object
  for testing if given inputs for online DAMON parameters update is valid.
  The object is being used without an allocation failure check, and leaked
  when the test succeeds.  Fix the two bugs.


  This patch (of 2):

  The damon_ctx for testing online DAMON parameters commit inputs is used
  without its allocation failure check.  This could result in an invalid
  memory access.  Fix it by directly returning an error when the allocation
  failed.
