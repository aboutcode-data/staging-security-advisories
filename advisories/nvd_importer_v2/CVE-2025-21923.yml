  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: hid-steam: Fix use-after-free when detaching device

  When a hid-steam device is removed it must clean up the client_hdev used for
  intercepting hidraw access. This can lead to scheduling deferred work to
  reattach the input device. Though the cleanup cancels the deferred work, this
  was done before the client_hdev itself is cleaned up, so it gets rescheduled.
  This patch fixes the ordering to make sure the deferred work is properly
  canceled.
