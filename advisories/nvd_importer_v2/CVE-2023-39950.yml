aliases: []
summary: efibootguard is a simple UEFI boot loader with support for safely switching between
  current and updated partition sets. Insufficient or missing validation and sanitization of
  input from untrustworthy bootloader environment files can cause crashes and probably also
  code injections into `bg_setenv`) or programs using `libebgenv`. This is triggered when the
  affected components try to modify a manipulated environment, in particular its user variables.
  Furthermore, `bg_printenv` may crash over invalid read accesses or report invalid results.
  Not affected by this issue is EFI Boot Guard's bootloader EFI binary. EFI Boot Guard release
  v0.15 contains required patches to sanitize and validate the bootloader environment prior
  to processing it in userspace. Its library and tools should be updated, so should programs
  statically linked against it. An update of the bootloader EFI executable is not required.
  The only way to prevent the issue with an unpatched EFI Boot Guard version is to avoid accesses
  to user variables, specifically modifications to them.
