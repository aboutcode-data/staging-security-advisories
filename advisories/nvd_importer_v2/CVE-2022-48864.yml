  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vdpa/mlx5: add validation for VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MQ_VQ_PAIRS_SET command

  When control vq receives a VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MQ_VQ_PAIRS_SET command
  request from the driver, presently there is no validation against the
  number of queue pairs to configure, or even if multiqueue had been
  negotiated or not is unverified. This may lead to kernel panic due to
  uninitialized resource for the queues were there any bogus request
  sent down by untrusted driver. Tie up the loose ends there.
