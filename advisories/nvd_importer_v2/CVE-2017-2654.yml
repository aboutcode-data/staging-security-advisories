aliases: []
summary: jenkins-email-ext before version 2.57.1 is vulnerable to an Information Exposure. The
  Email Extension Plugins is able to send emails to a dynamically created list of users based
  on the changelogs, like authors of SCM changes since the last successful build. This could
  in some cases result in emails being sent to people who have no user account in Jenkins, and
  in rare cases even people who were not involved in whatever project was being built, due to
  some mapping based on the local-part of email addresses.
