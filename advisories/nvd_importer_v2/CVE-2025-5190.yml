aliases: []
summary: The Browse As plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 0.2. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the 'IS_BA_Browse_As::notice'
  function with the 'is_ba_original_user_COOKIEHASH' cookie value. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing
  user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id.
