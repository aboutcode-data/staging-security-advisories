aliases: []
summary: 'A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in the JavaScript library
  microlight version 0.0.7. This library, used for syntax highlighting, does not limit the size
  of textual content it processes in HTML elements with the microlight class. When excessively
  large content (e.g., 100 million characters) is processed, the reset function in microlight.js
  consumes excessive memory and CPU resources, causing browser crashes or unresponsiveness.
  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web
  page containing a microlight element with large content, resulting in a denial of service.
  NOTE: this is disputed by multiple parties because a large amount of memory and CPU resources
  is expected to be needed for content of that size.'
