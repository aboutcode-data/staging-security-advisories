aliases: []
summary: The Archify application contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to
  insufficient client validation in its privileged helper tool, com.oct4pie.archifyhelper, which
  is exposed via XPC. Archify follows the "factored applications" model, delegating privileged
  operations—such as arbitrary file deletion and file permission changes—to this helper running
  as root. However, the helper does not verify the code signature, entitlements, or signing
  flags of the connecting client. Although macOS provides secure validation mechanisms like
  auditToken, these are not implemented. As a result, any local process can establish a connection
  to the helper and invoke privileged functionality, leading to unauthorized execution of actions
  with root-level privileges.
