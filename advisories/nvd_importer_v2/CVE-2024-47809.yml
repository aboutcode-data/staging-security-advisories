  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dlm: fix possible lkb_resource null dereference

  This patch fixes a possible null pointer dereference when this function is
  called from request_lock() as lkb->lkb_resource is not assigned yet,
  only after validate_lock_args() by calling attach_lkb(). Another issue
  is that a resource name could be a non printable bytearray and we cannot
  assume to be ASCII coded.

  The log functionality is probably never being hit when DLM is used in
  normal way and no debug logging is enabled. The null pointer dereference
  can only occur on a new created lkb that does not have the resource
  assigned yet, it probably never hits the null pointer dereference but we
  should be sure that other changes might not change this behaviour and we
  actually can hit the mentioned null pointer dereference.

  In this patch we just drop the printout of the resource name, the lkb id
  is enough to make a possible connection to a resource name if this
  exists.
