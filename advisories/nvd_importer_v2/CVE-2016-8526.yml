aliases: []
summary: Aruba Airwave all versions up to, but not including, 8.2.3.1 is vulnerable to an XML
  external entities (XXE). XXEs are a way to permit XML parsers to access storage that exist
  on external systems. If an unprivileged user is permitted to control the contents of XML files,
  XXE can be used as an attack vector. Because the XML parser has access to the local filesystem
  and runs with the permissions of the web server, it can access any file that is readable by
  the web server and copy it to an external system of the attacker's choosing. This could include
  files that contain passwords, which could then lead to privilege escalation.
