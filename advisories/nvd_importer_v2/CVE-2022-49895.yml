  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cxl/region: Fix decoder allocation crash

  When an intermediate port's decoders have been exhausted by existing
  regions, and creating a new region with the port in question in it's
  hierarchical path is attempted, cxl_port_attach_region() fails to find a
  port decoder (as would be expected), and drops into the failure / cleanup
  path.

  However, during cleanup of the region reference, a sanity check attempts
  to dereference the decoder, which in the above case didn't exist. This
  causes a NULL pointer dereference BUG.

  To fix this, refactor the decoder allocation and de-allocation into
  helper routines, and in this 'free' routine, check that the decoder,
  @cxld, is valid before attempting any operations on it.
