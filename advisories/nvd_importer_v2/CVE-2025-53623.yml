aliases: []
summary: The Job Iteration API is an an extension for ActiveJob that make jobs interruptible
  and resumable Versions prior to 1.11.0 have an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the
  `CsvEnumerator` class. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary
  commands on the system where the application is running, potentially leading to unauthorized
  access, data leakage, or complete system compromise. The issue is fixed in versions `1.11.0`
  and above. Users can mitigate the risk by avoiding the use of untrusted input in the `CsvEnumerator`
  class and ensuring that any file paths are properly sanitized and validated before being passed
  to the class methods. Users should avoid using the `count_of_rows_in_file` method with untrusted
  CSV filenames.
