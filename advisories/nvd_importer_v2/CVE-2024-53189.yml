summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan

  The channels array in the cfg80211_scan_request has a __counted_by
  attribute attached to it, which points to the n_channels variable. This
  attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the
  array is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a
  kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.

  This patch sets the size of allocated memory as the initial value for
  n_channels. It is updated with the actual number of added elements after
  the array is filled.
