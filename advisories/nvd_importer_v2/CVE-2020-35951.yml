aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the Quiz and Survey Master plugin before 7.0.1 for WordPress.
  It allows users to delete arbitrary files such as wp-config.php file, which could effectively
  take a site offline and allow an attacker to reinstall with a WordPress instance under their
  control. This occurred via qsm_remove_file_fd_question, which allowed unauthenticated deletions
  (even though it was only intended for a person to delete their own quiz-answer files).
