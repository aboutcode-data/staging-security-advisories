aliases: []
summary: LogicalDoc before 8.3.3 could allow an attacker to upload arbitrary files, leading
  to command execution or retrieval of data from the database. LogicalDoc provides a functionality
  to add documents. Those documents could then be used for multiple tasks, such as version control,
  shared among users, applying tags, etc. This functionality could be abused by an unauthenticated
  attacker to upload an arbitrary file in a restricted folder. This would lead to the executions
  of malicious commands with root privileges.
