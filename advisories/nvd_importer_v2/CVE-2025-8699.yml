aliases: []
summary: Some "Stored Value" Unattended Payment Solutions of KioSoft use vulnerable NFC cards.
  Attackers could potentially use this vulnerability to change the balance on the cards and
  generate money. The account balance is stored on an insecure MiFare Classic NFC card and can
  be read and written back. By carefully observing changes in card dumps, one can identify fields
  that store the cash value of the card. Additionally, a checksum can be identified, which is
  created by XOR-ing the cash and an unknown field with a certain value. By updating the fields
  accordingly, arbitrary amounts of money can be loaded onto the card (up to $655,35) to pay
  for goods.
