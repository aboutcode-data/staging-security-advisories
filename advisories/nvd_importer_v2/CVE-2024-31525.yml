aliases: []
summary: Peppermint Ticket Management 0.4.6 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. A regular
  registered user is able to elevate his privileges to admin and gain complete access to the
  system as the authorization mechanism is not validated on the server side and only on the
  client side. This can result, for example, in creating a new admin user in the system which
  enables persistent access for the attacker as an administrator.
