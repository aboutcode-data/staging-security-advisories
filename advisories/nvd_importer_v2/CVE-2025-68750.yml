summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: potential integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()

  The variable tpgt in usbg_make_tpg() is defined as unsigned long and is
  assigned to tpgt->tport_tpgt, which is defined as u16. This may cause an
  integer overflow when tpgt is greater than USHRT_MAX (65535). I
  haven't tried to trigger it myself, but it is possible to trigger it
  by calling usbg_make_tpg() with a large value for tpgt.

  I modified the type of tpgt to match tpgt->tport_tpgt and adjusted the
  relevant code accordingly.

  This patch is similar to commit 59c816c1f24d ("vhost/scsi: potential
  memory corruption").
