aliases: []
summary: The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User
  Deletion due to a missing authorization within the ajax_delete_employee() function in versions
  2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The plugin’s deletion handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['delete']
  array and passes each ID directly to wp_delete_user() without verifying that the caller has
  the delete_users capability or limiting which user IDs may be removed. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to delete arbitrary accounts,
  including administrators.
