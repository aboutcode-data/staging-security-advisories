summary: The CE21 Suite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1 via the log file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to extract sensitive data including authentication credentials, which can be used
  to log in as other users as long as they have used the plugin's custom authentication feature
  before. This may include administrators, which makes a complete site takeover possible.
