summary: The Config File Provider Plugin is used to centrally manage configuration files that
  often include secrets, such as passwords. Users with only Overall/Read access to Jenkins were
  able to access URLs directly that allowed viewing these files. Access to view these files
  now requires sufficient permissions to configure the provided files, view the configuration
  of the folder in which the configuration files are defined, or have Job/Configure permissions
  to a job able to use these files.
