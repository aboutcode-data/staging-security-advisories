summary: The Maspik plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in version 2.5.6
  and prior. This is due to missing capability checks on the Maspik_spamlog_download_csv function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
  to export and download the spam log database containing blocked submission attempts, which
  may include misclassified but legitimate submissions with sensitive data.
