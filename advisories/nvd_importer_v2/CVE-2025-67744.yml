aliases: []
summary: DeepChat is an open-source artificial intelligence agent platform that unifies models,
  tools, and agents. Prior to version 0.5.3, a security vulnerability exists in the Mermaid
  diagram rendering component that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution. Due to the exposure
  of the Electron IPC renderer to the DOM, this Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw escalates to
  full Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands.
  Two concurrent issues, unsafe Mermaid configuration and an exposed IPC interface, cause this
  issue. Version 0.5.3 contains a patch.
