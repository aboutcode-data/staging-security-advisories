aliases: []
summary: go-tuf is a Go implementation of The Update Framework (TUF). Starting in version 2.0.0
  and prior to version 2.3.1, a compromised or misconfigured TUF repository can have the configured
  value of signature thresholds set to 0, which effectively disables signature verification.
  This can lead to unauthorized modification to TUF metadata files is possible at rest, or during
  transit as no integrity checks are made. Version 2.3.1 fixes the issue. As a workaround, always
  make sure that the TUF metadata roles are configured with a threshold of at least 1.
