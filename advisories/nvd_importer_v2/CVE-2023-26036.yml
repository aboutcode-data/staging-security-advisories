summary: ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application for
  Linux which supports IP, USB and Analog cameras. Versions prior to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33 contain
  a Local File Inclusion (Untrusted Search Path) vulnerability via /web/index.php. By controlling
  $view, any local file ending in .php can be executed. This is supposed to be mitigated by
  calling detaintPath, however dentaintPath does not properly sandbox the path. This can be
  exploited by constructing paths like "..././", which get replaced by "../". This issue is
  patched in versions 1.36.33 and 1.37.33.
