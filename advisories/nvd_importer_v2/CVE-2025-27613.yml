aliases: []
summary: Gitk is a Tcl/Tk based Git history browser. Starting with 1.7.0, when a user clones
  an untrusted repository and runs gitk without additional command arguments, files for which
  the user has write permission can be created and truncated. The option Support per-file encoding
  must have been enabled before in Gitk's Preferences. This option is disabled by default. The
  same happens when Show origin of this line is used in the main window (regardless of whether
  Support per-file encoding is enabled or not). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.43.7, 2.44.4,
  2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50.1.
