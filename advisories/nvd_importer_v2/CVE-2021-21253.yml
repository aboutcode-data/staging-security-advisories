aliases: []
summary: OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub. OnlineVotingSystem before
  version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
  Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is
  much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques
  such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version
  1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect
  passwords stored in the voting system.
