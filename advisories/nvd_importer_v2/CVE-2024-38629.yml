aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida

  file_ida is allocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly
  during cdev release. This sequence is guaranteed by driver file
  operations. Therefore, there is no need to destroy an already empty
  file_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.

  Worse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of
  file_ida per WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida
  after it has been destroyed, resulting in a kernel panic.

  Remove ida_destroy(&file_ida) to address these issues.
