aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management
  Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. These
  vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based
  management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted
  input into various data fields in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, or access sensitive,
  browser-based information. In some cases, it is also possible to cause a temporary availability
  impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.
