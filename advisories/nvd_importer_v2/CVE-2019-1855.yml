aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific dynamic link libraries in Cisco
  Jabber for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL preloading
  attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on
  the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded
  by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a
  malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious
  DLL file would execute when the Jabber application launches. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of another
  user's account.
