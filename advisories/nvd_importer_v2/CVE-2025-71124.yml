  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/msm/a6xx: move preempt_prepare_postamble after error check

  Move the call to preempt_prepare_postamble() after verifying that
  preempt_postamble_ptr is valid. If preempt_postamble_ptr is NULL,
  dereferencing it in preempt_prepare_postamble() would lead to a crash.

  This change avoids calling the preparation function when the
  postamble allocation has failed, preventing potential NULL pointer
  dereference and ensuring proper error handling.
