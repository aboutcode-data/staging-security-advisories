summary: Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Graylog makes use of only one single
  source port for DNS queries. Graylog binds a single socket for outgoing DNS queries and while
  that socket is bound to a random port number it is never changed again. This goes against
  recommended practice since 2008, when Dan Kaminsky discovered how easy is to carry out DNS
  cache poisoning attacks. In order to prevent cache poisoning with spoofed DNS responses, it
  is necessary to maximise the uncertainty in the choice of a source port for a DNS query. Although
  unlikely in many setups, an external attacker could inject forged DNS responses into a Graylog's
  lookup table cache. In order to prevent this, it is at least recommendable to distribute the
  DNS queries through a pool of distinct sockets, each of them with a random source port and
  renew them periodically. This issue has been addressed in versions 5.0.9 and 5.1.3. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
