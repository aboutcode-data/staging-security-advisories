aliases: []
summary: h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The configuration
  directives provided by the headers handler allows users to modify the response headers being
  sent by h2o. The configuration file of h2o has scopes, and the inner scopes (e.g., path level)
  are expected to inherit the configuration defined in outer scopes (e.g., global level). However,
  if a header directive is used in the inner scope, all the definition in outer scopes are ignored.
  This can lead to headers not being modified as expected. Depending on the headers being added
  or removed unexpectedly, this behavior could lead to unexpected client behavior. This vulnerability
  is fixed in commit 123f5e2b65dcdba8f7ef659a00d24bd1249141be.
