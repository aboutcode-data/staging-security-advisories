summary: 'An issue was discovered in Heimdal Thor agent versions 3.4.2 and before on Windows
  and 2.6.9 and before on macOS, allows attackers to bypass network filtering, execute arbitrary
  code, and obtain sensitive information via DarkLayer Guard threat prevention module. NOTE:
  Heimdal disputes the validity of this issue arguing that their DNS Security for Endpoint filters
  DNS traffic on the endpoint by intercepting system-generated DNS requests. The product was
  not designed to intercept DNS requests from third-party solutions.'
