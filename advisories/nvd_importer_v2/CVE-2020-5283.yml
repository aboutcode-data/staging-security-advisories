aliases: []
summary: ViewVC before versions 1.1.28 and 1.2.1 has a XSS vulnerability in CVS show_subdir_lastmod
  support. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have
  commit privileges to a CVS repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance that
  also has the `show_subdir_lastmod` feature enabled. The attack vector involves files with
  unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run
  unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. This vulnerability is patched
  in versions 1.2.1 and 1.1.28.
