summary: 'Wire-server is the backing server for the open source wire secure messaging application.
  In affected versions it is possible to trigger email address change of a user with only the
  short-lived session token in the `Authorization` header. As the short-lived token is only
  meant as means of authentication by the client for less critical requests to the backend,
  the ability to change the email address with a short-lived token constitutes a privilege escalation
  attack. Since the attacker can change the password after setting the email address to one
  that they control, changing the email address can result in an account takeover by the attacker.
  Short-lived tokens can be requested from the backend by Wire clients using the long lived
  tokens, after which the long lived tokens can be stored securely, for example on the devices
  key chain. The short lived tokens can then be used to authenticate the client towards the
  backend for frequently performed actions such as sending and receiving messages. While short-lived
  tokens should not be available to an attacker per-se, they are used more often and in the
  shape of an HTTP header, increasing the risk of exposure to an attacker relative to the long-lived
  tokens, which are stored and transmitted in cookies. If you are running an on-prem instance
  and provision all users with SCIM, you are not affected by this issue (changing email is blocked
  for SCIM users). SAML single-sign-on is unaffected by this issue, and behaves identically
  before and after this update. The reason is that the email address used as SAML NameID is
  stored in a different location in the databse from the one used to contact the user outside
  wire. Version 2021-08-16 and later provide a new end-point that requires both the long-lived
  client cookie and `Authorization` header. The old end-point has been removed. If you are running
  an on-prem instance with at least some of the users invited or provisioned via SAML SSO and
  you cannot update then you can block `/self/email` on nginz (or in any other proxies or firewalls
  you may have set up). You don''t need to discriminate by verb: `/self/email` only accepts
  `PUT` and `DELETE`, and `DELETE` is almost never used.'
