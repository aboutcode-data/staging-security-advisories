aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to Nextcloud
  Server versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, the Two-Factor Authentication wasn't enforced
  for pages marked as public. Any page marked as `@PublicPage` could thus be accessed with a
  valid user session that isn't authenticated. This particularly affects the Nextcloud Talk
  application, as this could be leveraged to gain access to any private chat channel without
  going through the Two-Factor flow. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded
  to 20.0.13, 21.0.5 or 22.2.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
