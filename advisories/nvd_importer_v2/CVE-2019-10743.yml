aliases: []
summary: All versions of archiver allow attacker to perform a Zip Slip attack via the "unarchive"
  functions. It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal
  filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target
  extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder.
  For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of
  the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing
  malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.
