summary: The AP Background plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing authorization and insufficient file validation within the advParallaxBackAdminSaveSlider()

  Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
