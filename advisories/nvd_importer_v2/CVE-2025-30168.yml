aliases: []
summary: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that
  can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse
  Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to
  be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same
  authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one
  app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects
  Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for
  user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse
  Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server
  to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure
  payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2.
