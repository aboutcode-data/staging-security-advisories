aliases: []
summary: 'Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.1.8 has Incorrect Access Control.
  Project-level access control configuration was introduced in Enterprise Config schema version
  8. Migration functionality from schema version 8 to versions 9 and 10 (in affected vulnerable
  versions) does not include the projects section of the configuration. This leads to all of
  the project settings being reset to their defaults when the old schema is loaded. In the case
  of projects.enabled, the default is false. Thus, using an enterprise config v8 results in
  Project level access control being disabled, even if it was previously enabled, and previously
  restricted project information disclosed. Most commonly, this occurs when a Develocity instance
  is upgraded from an earlier version. Specifically, this occurs if: Develocity 2023.3.X is
  upgraded to 2023.4.X; Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7;
  or Develocity 2023.4.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7. The flaw does
  not occur when upgrading to a fixed version. An upgrade can only be triggered via administrator
  access, and cannot be forced by an external attacker.'
