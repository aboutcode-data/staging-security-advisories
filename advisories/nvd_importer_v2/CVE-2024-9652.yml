summary: The Locatoraid Store Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting via $_POST keys in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.47 due to insufficient

  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
