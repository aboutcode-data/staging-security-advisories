aliases: []
summary: The Tiger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 101.2.1. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to update the user
  role through the $user->set_role() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.
