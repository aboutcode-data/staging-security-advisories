aliases: []
summary: The Microsoft Azure Storage for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized
  Arbitrary Media Deletion in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.1. This is due to missing
  capability checks on the 'azure-storage-media-replace' AJAX action. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to delete arbitrary media
  files from the WordPress Media Library via the replace_attachment parameter granted they can
  access the nonce which is exposed to all authenticated users.
