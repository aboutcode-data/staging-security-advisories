aliases: []
summary: Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Papermerge before 1.5.2 allow
  remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the rename, tag, upload, or create
  folder function. The payload can be in a folder, a tag, or a document's filename. If email
  consumption is configured in Papermerge, a malicious document can be sent by email and is
  automatically uploaded into the Papermerge web application. Therefore, no authentication is
  required to exploit XSS if email consumption is configured. Otherwise authentication is required.
