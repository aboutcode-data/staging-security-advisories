summary: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server.
  Starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version 3.7.0, by trusting that the server will return
  a certificate that belongs to the keypair of the user, a malicious server could get the desktop
  client to encrypt files with a key known to the attacker. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud
  Desktop 3.7.0. No known workarounds are available.
