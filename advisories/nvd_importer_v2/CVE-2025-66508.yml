aliases: []
summary: '1Panel is an open-source, web-based control panel for Linux server management. Versions
  2.0.14 and below use Gin''s default configuration which trusts all IP addresses as proxies
  (TrustedProxies = 0.0.0.0/0), allowing any client to spoof the X-Forwarded-For header. Since
  all IP-based access controls (AllowIPs, API whitelists, localhost-only checks) rely on ClientIP(),
  attackers can bypass these protections by simply sending X-Forwarded-For:  127.0.0.1 or any
  whitelisted IP. This renders all IP-based security controls ineffective. This issue is fixed
  in version 2.0.14.'
