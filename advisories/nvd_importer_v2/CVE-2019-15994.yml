summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface
  of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user
  to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
