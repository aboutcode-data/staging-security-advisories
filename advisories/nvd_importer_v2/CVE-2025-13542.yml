aliases: []
summary: The DesignThemes LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to the 'dtlms_register_user_front_end'
  function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain
  administrator access to the site.
