aliases: []
summary: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository,
  specifically within the handling of the Content-Type header in POST requests. An attacker
  can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Content-Type header, which is then improperly
  reflected back to the user without adequate sanitization or escaping, leading to arbitrary
  JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser. The vulnerability is present
  in the mlflow/server/auth/__init__.py file, where the user-supplied Content-Type header is
  directly injected into a Python formatted string and returned to the user, facilitating the
  XSS attack.
