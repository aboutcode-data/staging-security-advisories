aliases: []
summary: The kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.21.0 via the 'TH_LatestPosts4` widget. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary
  .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can
  be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases
  where .php file types can be uploaded and included.
