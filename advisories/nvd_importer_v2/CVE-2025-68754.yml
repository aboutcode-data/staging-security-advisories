summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rtc: amlogic-a4: fix double free caused by devm

  The clock obtained via devm_clk_get_enabled() is automatically managed
  by devres and will be disabled and freed on driver detach. Manually
  calling clk_disable_unprepare() in error path and remove function
  causes double free.

  Remove the redundant clk_disable_unprepare() calls from the probe
  error path and aml_rtc_remove(), allowing the devm framework to
  automatically manage the clock lifecycle.
