summary: 'A vulnerability in the device manager web interface of Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  attack against a user of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF
  protection by the device manager web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled
  website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to an
  affected device via the device manager web interface with the privileges of the user. This
  vulnerability affects the following Cisco Industrial Ethernet (IE) Switches if they are running
  a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software: IE 2000 Series, IE 2000U Series, IE 3000 Series,
  IE 3010 Series, IE 4000 Series, IE 4010 Series, IE 5000 Series. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc96405.'
