aliases: []
summary: YMS VIS Pro is an information system for veterinary and food administration, veterinarians
  and farm. Due to a combination of improper method for system credentials generation and weak
  password policy, passwords can be easily guessed and enumerated through brute force attacks.
  Successful attacks can lead to unauthorised access and execution of operations based on assigned
  user permissions. This vulnerability affects VIS Pro in versions <= 3.3.0.6. This vulnerability
  has been mitigated by changes in authentication mechanisms and implementation of additional
  authentication layer and strong password policies.
