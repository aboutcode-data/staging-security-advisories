aliases: []
summary: Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments.
  A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the MOSS cheat checker functionality of Autolab. To
  exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to
  upload a specially crafted Tar file. Both "Base File Tar" and "Additional file archive" can
  be fed with Tar files that contain paths outside their target directories (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped2.sh`).
  When the MOSS cheat checker is started the files inside of the archives are expanded to the
  attacker-chosen locations. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write within the scope of
  the running process.  This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to
  upgrade.
