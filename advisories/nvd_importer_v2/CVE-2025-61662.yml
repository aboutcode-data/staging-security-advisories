aliases: []
summary: A Use-After-Free vulnerability has been discovered in GRUB's gettext module. This flaw
  stems from a programming error where the gettext command remains registered in memory after
  its module is unloaded. An attacker can exploit this condition by invoking the orphaned command,
  causing the application to access a memory location that is no longer valid. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability to cause grub to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Possible
  data integrity or confidentiality compromise is not discarded.
