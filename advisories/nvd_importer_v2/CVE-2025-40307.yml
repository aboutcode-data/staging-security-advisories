  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  exfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap

  syzbot created an exfat image with cluster bits not set for the allocation
  bitmap. exfat-fs reads and uses the allocation bitmap without checking
  this. The problem is that if the start cluster of the allocation bitmap
  is 6, cluster 6 can be allocated when creating a directory with mkdir.
  exfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir, which can delete existing
  entries. This can reallocate the allocated entries. In addition,
  the allocation bitmap is also zeroed out, so cluster 6 can be reallocated.
  This patch adds exfat_test_bitmap_range to validate that clusters used for
  the allocation bitmap are correctly marked as in-use.
