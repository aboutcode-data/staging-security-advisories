aliases: []
summary: Microsoft Identity Web is a library which contains a set of reusable classes used in
  conjunction with ASP.NET Core for integrating with the Microsoft identity platform (formerly
  Azure AD v2.0 endpoint) and AAD B2C. This vulnerability affects confidential client applications,
  including daemons, web apps, and web APIs. Under specific circumstances, sensitive information
  such as client secrets or certificate details may be exposed in the service logs of these
  applications. Service logs are intended to be handled securely. Service logs generated at
  the information level or credential descriptions containing local file paths with passwords,
  Base64 encoded values, or Client secret. Additionally, logs of services using Base64 encoded
  certificates or certificate paths with password credential descriptions are also affected
  if the certificates are invalid or expired, regardless of the log level. Note that these credentials
  are not usable due to their invalid or expired status. To mitigate this vulnerability, update
  to Microsoft.Identity.Web 3.8.2 or Microsoft.Identity.Abstractions 9.0.0.
