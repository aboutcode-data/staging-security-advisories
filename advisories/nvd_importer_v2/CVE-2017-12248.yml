aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the web interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected software.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link
  or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected
  site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve76835.'
