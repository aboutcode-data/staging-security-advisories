aliases: []
summary: Wowza Streaming Engine through 4.8.11+5 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to exhaust filesystem resources via the /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata vhost
  parameter. This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting
  random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive
  to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and
  return the application to an operational state.)
