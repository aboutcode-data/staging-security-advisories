aliases: []
summary: Spotipy is a light weight Python library for the Spotify Web API. In versions prior
  to 2.22.1, if a malicious URI is passed to the library, the library can be tricked into performing
  an operation on a different API endpoint than intended. The code Spotipy uses to parse URIs
  and URLs allows an attacker to insert arbitrary characters into the path that is used for
  API requests. Because it is possible to include "..", an attacker can redirect for example
  a track lookup via spotifyApi.track() to an arbitrary API endpoint like playlists, but this
  is possible for other endpoints as well. The impact of this vulnerability depends heavily
  on what operations a client application performs when it handles a URI from a user and how
  it uses the responses it receives from the API. This issue is patched in version 2.22.1.
