aliases: []
summary: The Blaze Demo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized database
  resets and file deletion due to a missing capability check on the "blaze_demo_importer_install_demo"
  function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.13. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to reset the database by truncating all
  tables (except options, usermeta, and users), delete all sidebar widgets, theme modifications,
  and content of the uploads folder.
