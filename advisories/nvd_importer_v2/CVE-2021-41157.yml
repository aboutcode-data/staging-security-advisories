aliases: []
summary: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation
  from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity
  hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected
  versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user
  agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns
  and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able
  to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6,
  installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still
  be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update
  the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so
  that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter.
  When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable
  authentication.
