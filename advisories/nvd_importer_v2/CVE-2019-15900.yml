aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in slicer69 doas before 6.2 on certain platforms other than
  OpenBSD. On platforms without strtonum(3), sscanf was used without checking for error cases.
  Instead, the uninitialized variable errstr was checked and in some cases returned success
  even if sscanf failed. The result was that, instead of reporting that the supplied username
  or group name did not exist, it would execute the command as root.
