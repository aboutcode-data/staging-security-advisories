aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
  2.0 single sign-on (SSO) for remote access VPN in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)
  Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
  remote attacker to intercept the SAML assertion of a user who is authenticating to a remote
  access VPN session. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the login URL.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a site that is
  under the control of the attacker, allowing the attacker to modify the login URL. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to intercept a successful SAML assertion and use that assertion
  to establish a remote access VPN session toward the affected device with the identity and
  permissions of the hijacked user, resulting in access to the protected network.
