summary: The Video Gallery – YouTube Playlist, Channel Gallery by YotuWP plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.13 via the
  display function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access
  and higher, to include and execute arbitrary php files on the server, allowing the execution
  of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive
  data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded
  and included.
