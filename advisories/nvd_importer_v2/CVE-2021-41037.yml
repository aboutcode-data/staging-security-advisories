aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse p2, installable units are able to alter the Eclipse Platform installation
  and the local machine via touchpoints during installation. Those touchpoints can, for example,
  alter the command-line used to start the application, injecting things like agent or other
  settings that usually require particular attention in term of security. Although p2 has built-in
  strategies to ensure artifacts are signed and then to help establish trust, there is no such
  strategy for the metadata part that does configure such touchpoints. As a result, it's possible
  to install a unit that will run malicious code during installation without user receiving
  any warning about this installation step being risky when coming from untrusted source.
