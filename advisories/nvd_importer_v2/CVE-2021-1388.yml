aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in an API endpoint of Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator (MSO) installed
  on the Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass
  authentication on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper token validation
  on a specific API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted
  request to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to receive a token
  with administrator-level privileges that could be used to authenticate to the API on affected
  MSO and managed Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices.
