aliases: []
summary: cosign is a container signing and verification utility. In versions prior to 1.10.1
  cosign can report a false positive if any attestation exists. `cosign verify-attestation`
  used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification when there is at least
  one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being verified
  (--type defaults to "custom"). This can happen when signing with a standard keypair and with
  "keyless" signing with Fulcio. This vulnerability can be reproduced with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2`
  image. This image has a `vuln` attestation but not an `spdx` attestation. However, if you
  run `cosign verify-attestation --type=spdx` on this image, it incorrectly succeeds. This issue
  has been addressed in version 1.10.1 of cosign. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this issue.
