summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: Prevent jump to NULL add_sidecar callback

  In create_sdw_dailink() check that sof_end->codec_info->add_sidecar
  is not NULL before calling it.

  The original code assumed that if include_sidecar is true, the codec
  on that link has an add_sidecar callback. But there could be other
  codecs on the same link that do not have an add_sidecar callback.
