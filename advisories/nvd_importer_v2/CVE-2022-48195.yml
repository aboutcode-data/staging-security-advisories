aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Mellium mellium.im/sasl before 0.3.1. When performing SCRAM-based
  SASL authentication, if the remote end advertises support for channel binding, no random nonce
  is generated (instead, the nonce is empty). This causes authentication to fail in the best
  case, but (if paired with a remote end that does not validate the length of the nonce) could
  lead to insufficient randomness being used during authentication.
