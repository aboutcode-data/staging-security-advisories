summary: The WP Quick Contact Us plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  settings update functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
