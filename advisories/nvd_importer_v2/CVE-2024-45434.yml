summary: OpenSynergy BlueSDK (aka Blue SDK) through 6.x has a Use-After-Free. The specific flaw
  exists within the BlueSDK Bluetooth stack. The issue results from the lack of validating the
  existence of an object before performing operations on the object (aka use after free). An
  attacker can leverage this to achieve remote code execution in the context of a user account
  under which the Bluetooth process runs.
