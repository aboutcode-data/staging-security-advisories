aliases: []
summary: WP Crontrol controls the cron events on WordPress websites.  WP Crontrol includes a
  feature that allows administrative users to create events in the WP-Cron system that store
  and execute PHP code subject to the restrictive security permissions documented here. While
  there is no known vulnerability in this feature on its own, there exists potential for this
  feature to be vulnerable to RCE if it were specifically targeted via vulnerability chaining
  that exploited a separate SQLi (or similar) vulnerability. This is exploitable on a site if
  one of the below preconditions are met, the site is vulnerable to a writeable SQLi vulnerability
  in any plugin, theme, or WordPress core, the site's database is compromised at the hosting
  level, the site is vulnerable to a method of updating arbitrary options in the wp_options
  table, or the site is vulnerable to a method of triggering an arbitrary action, filter, or
  function with control of the parameters.  As a hardening measure, WP Crontrol version 1.16.2
  ships with a new feature that prevents tampering of the code stored in a PHP cron event.
