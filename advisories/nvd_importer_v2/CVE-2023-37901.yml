aliases: []
summary: Indico is an open source a general-purpose, web based event management tool. There
  is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting
  content from Indico. Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such
  as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content. Considering that event
  organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible
  risk of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined
  with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content. Users need to
  update to Indico 3.2.6 as soon as possible. See the docs for instructions on how to update.
  Users who cannot upgrade should only let trustworthy users manage categories, create events
  or upload materials ("submission" privileges on a contribution/event). This should already
  be the case in a properly-configured setup when it comes to category/event management. Note
  that a conference doing a Call for Abstracts actively invites external speakers (who the organizers
  may not know and thus cannot fully trust) to submit content, hence the need to update to a
  a fixed version ASAP in particular when using such workflows.
