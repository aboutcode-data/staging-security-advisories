summary: 'DCTStream::getChars in DCTStream.cc in Poppler 20.12.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow
  via a crafted PDF document. NOTE: later reports indicate that this only affects builds from
  Poppler git clones in late December 2020, not the 20.12.1 release. In this situation, it should
  NOT be considered a Poppler vulnerability. However, several third-party Open Source projects
  directly rely on Poppler git clones made at arbitrary times, and therefore the CVE remains
  useful to users of those projects'
