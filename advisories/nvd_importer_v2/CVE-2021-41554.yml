summary: 'ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests
  for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints: /archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw,
  /archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw,
  /archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw. By not verifying
  the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that
  are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative
  console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows
  a malicious user to modify all users'' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative
  ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of
  other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page.
  This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects
  products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported
  by the end of 2020'
