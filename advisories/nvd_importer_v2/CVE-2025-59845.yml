aliases: []
summary: Apollo Studio Embeddable Explorer & Embeddable Sandbox are website embeddable software
  solutions from Apollo GraphQL. Prior to Apollo Sandbox version 2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version
  3.7.3, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was identified. The vulnerability
  arises from missing origin validation in the client-side code that handles window.postMessage
  events. A malicious website can send forged messages to the embedding page, causing the victim’s
  browser to execute arbitrary GraphQL queries or mutations against their GraphQL server while
  authenticated with the victim’s cookies. This issue has been patched in Apollo Sandbox version
  2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version 3.7.3.
