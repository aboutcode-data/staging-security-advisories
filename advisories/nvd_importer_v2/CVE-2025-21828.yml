aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mac80211: don't flush non-uploaded STAs

  If STA state is pre-moved to AUTHORIZED (such as in IBSS
  scenarios) and insertion fails, the station is freed.
  In this case, the driver never knew about the station,
  so trying to flush it is unexpected and may crash.

  Check if the sta was uploaded to the driver before and
  fix this.
