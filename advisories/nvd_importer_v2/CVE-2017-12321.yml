aliases: []
summary: 'Multiple vulnerabilities in the web interface of the Cisco Registered Envelope Service
  (a cloud-based service) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack or redirect a user of the affected service to an undesired web page.
  The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based
  management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  by persuading a user to click a malicious link or by sending an HTTP request that could cause
  the affected service to redirect the request to a specified malicious URL. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface
  of the affected system or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information
  on the affected system. These types of exploits could also be used in phishing attacks that
  send users to malicious websites without their knowledge. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77195, CSCve90978,
  CSCvf42310, CSCvf42703, CSCvf42723, CSCvf46169, CSCvf49999.'
