summary: The Delete Custom Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 0.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the ajax_delete_field() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete arbitrary post meta data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
