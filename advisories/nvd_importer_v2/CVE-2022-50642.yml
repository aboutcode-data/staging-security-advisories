  platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: zero out stale pointers

  `cros_typec_get_switch_handles` allocates four pointers when obtaining
  type-c switch handles. These pointers are all freed if failing to obtain
  any of them; therefore, pointers in `port` become stale. The stale
  pointers eventually cause use-after-free or double free in later code
  paths. Zeroing out all pointer fields after freeing to eliminate these
  stale pointers.
