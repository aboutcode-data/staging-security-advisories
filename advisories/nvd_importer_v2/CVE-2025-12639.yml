aliases: []
summary: The wModes – Catalog Mode, Product Pricing, Enquiry Forms & Promotions plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due
  to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to access sensitive information
  via the AJAX endpoint. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  access and above, to extract sensitive information including user emails, usernames, roles,
  capabilities, and WooCommerce data such as products and payment methods.
