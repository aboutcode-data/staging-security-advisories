summary: Caido is a web security auditing toolkit. A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  was discovered in Caido’s toast UI component in versions prior to 0.49.0. Toast messages may
  reflect unsanitized user input in certain tools such as Match&Replace and Scope. This could
  allow an attacker to craft input that results in arbitrary script execution. Version 0.49.0
  fixes the issue.
