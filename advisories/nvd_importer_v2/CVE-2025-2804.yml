aliases: []
summary: The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress, used by the Newspaper theme, is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'account_id' and 'account_username' parameters in
  all versions up to, and including, 5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
