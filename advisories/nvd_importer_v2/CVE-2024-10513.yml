aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the 'document uploads manager' feature of
  mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting the latest version prior to 1.2.2. This vulnerability
  allows users with the 'manager' role to access and manipulate the 'anythingllm.db' database
  file. By exploiting the vulnerable endpoint '/api/document/move-files', an attacker can move
  the database file to a publicly accessible directory, download it, and subsequently delete
  it. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and potential
  data loss.
