aliases: []
summary: On sites that also had the Elementor plugin for WordPress installed, it was possible
  for users with the edit_posts capability, which includes Contributor-level users, to import
  blocks onto any page using the astra-page-elementor-batch-process AJAX action. An attacker
  could craft and host a block containing malicious JavaScript on a server they controlled,
  and then use it to overwrite any post or page by sending an AJAX request with the action set
  to astra-page-elementor-batch-process and the url parameter pointed to their remotely-hosted
  malicious block, as well as an id parameter containing the post or page to overwrite. Any
  post or page that had been built with Elementor, including published pages, could be overwritten
  by the imported block, and the malicious JavaScript in the imported block would then be executed
  in the browser of any visitors to that page.
