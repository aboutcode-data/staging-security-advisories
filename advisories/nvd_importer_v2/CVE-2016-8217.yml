aliases: []
summary: EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2 has a PKCS#12 Timing Attack Vulnerability.
  A possible timing attack could be carried out by modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity
  MAC for which the password is not known. An attacker could then feed the modified PKCS#12
  file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at a time. This is possible because
  Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time method to compare the stored MAC with the calculated MAC.
  This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-2601.
