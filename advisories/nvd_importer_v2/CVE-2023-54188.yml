  dmaengine: apple-admac: Fix 'current_tx' not getting freed

  In terminate_all we should queue up all submitted descriptors to be
  freed. We do that for the content of the 'issued' and 'submitted' lists,
  but the 'current_tx' descriptor falls through the cracks as it's
  removed from the 'issued' list once it gets assigned to be the current
  descriptor. Explicitly queue up freeing of the 'current_tx' descriptor
  to address a memory leak that is otherwise present.
