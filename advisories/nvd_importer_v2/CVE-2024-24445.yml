aliases: []
summary: OpenAirInterface CN5G AMF (oai-cn5g-amf) <= 2.0.0 contains a null dereference in its
  handling of unsupported NGAP protocol messages which allows an attacker with network-adjacent
  access to the AMF to carry out denial of service. When a procedure code/presence field tuple
  is received that is unsupported, OAI indexes into a null function pointer and subsequently
  dereferences it.
