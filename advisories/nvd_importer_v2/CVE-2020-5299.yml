datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5299
aliases: []
summary: 'In OctoberCMS (october/october composer package) versions from 1.0.319 and before
  1.0.466, any users with the ability to modify any data that could eventually be exported as
  a CSV file from the `ImportExportController` could potentially introduce a CSV injection into
  the data to cause the generated CSV export file to be malicious. This requires attackers to
  achieve the following before a successful attack can be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability
  in the victims spreadsheet software of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially be exported
  through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. 3. Convince the victim to export
  above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any
  sanity checks by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466).'
