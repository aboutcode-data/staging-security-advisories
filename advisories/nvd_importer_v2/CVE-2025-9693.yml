aliases: []
summary: The User Meta – User Profile Builder and User management plugin plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the postInsertUserProcess
  function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server,
  which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
