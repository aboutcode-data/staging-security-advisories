aliases: []
summary: free5GC is an open-source project for 5th generation (5G) mobile core networks. free5GC
  go-upf versions up to and including 1.2.6, corresponding to free5gc smf up to and including
  1.4.0, have an Improper Input Validation and Protocol Compliance vulnerability leading to
  Denial of Service. Remote attackers can disrupt core network functionality by sending a malformed
  PFCP Association Setup Request. The UPF incorrectly accepts it, entering an inconsistent state
  that causes subsequent legitimate requests to trigger SMF reconnection loops and service degradation.
  All deployments of free5GC using the UPF and SMF components may be affected. As of time of
  publication, a fix is in development but not yet available. No direct workaround is available
  at the application level. Applying the official patch, once released, is recommended.
