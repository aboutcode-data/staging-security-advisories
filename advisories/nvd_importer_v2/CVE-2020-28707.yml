aliases: []
summary: The Stockdio Historical Chart plugin before 2.8.1 for WordPress is affected by Cross
  Site Scripting (XSS) via stockdio_chart_historical-wp.js in wp-content/plugins/stockdio-historical-chart/assets/
  because the origin of a postMessage() event is not validated. The stockdio_eventer function
  listens for any postMessage event. After a message event is sent to the application, this
  function sets the "e" variable as the event and checks that the types of the data and data.method
  are not undefined (empty) before proceeding to eval the data.method received from the postMessage.
  However, on a different website. JavaScript code can call window.open for the vulnerable WordPress
  instance and do a postMessage(msg,'*') for that object.
