aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Technitium DNS Server through 8.0.2 that allows variant
  V2 of unintended domain name resolution. A revoked domain name can still be resolvable for
  a long time, including expired domains and taken-down malicious domains. The effects of an
  exploit would be widespread and highly impactful, because the exploitation conforms to de
  facto DNS specifications and operational practices, and overcomes current mitigation patches
  for "Ghost" domain names.
