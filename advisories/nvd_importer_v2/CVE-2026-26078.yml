aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1,
  and 2026.2.0, when the `patreon_webhook_secret` site setting is blank, an attacker can forge
  valid webhook signatures by computing an HMAC-MD5 with an empty string as the key. Since the
  request body is known to the sender, the attacker can produce a matching signature and send
  arbitrary webhook payloads. This allows unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion of
  Patreon pledge data and triggering patron-to-group synchronization. This vulnerability is
  patched in versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0. The fix rejects webhook requests when
  the webhook secret is not configured, preventing signature forgery with an empty key. As a
  workaround, configure the `patreon_webhook_secret` site setting with a strong, non-empty secret
  value. When the secret is non-empty, an attacker cannot forge valid signatures without knowing
  the secret.
