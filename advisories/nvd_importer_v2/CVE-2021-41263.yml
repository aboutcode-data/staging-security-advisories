aliases: []
summary: rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected versions
  this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails'
  signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it
  may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site
  Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that
  this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation
  will vary based on the application architecture.
