aliases: []
summary: The User Meta – User Profile Builder and User management plugin plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.1
  via the getUser() due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to obtain user meta
  values from form fields. Please note that this requires a site administrator to create a form
  that displays potentially sensitive information like password hashes. This may also be exploited
  by unauthenticated users if the  'user-meta-public-profile' shortcode is used insecurely.
