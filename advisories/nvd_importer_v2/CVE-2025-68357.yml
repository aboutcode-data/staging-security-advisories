aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well

  Since commit 222f2c7c6d14 ("iomap: always run error completions in user
  context"), read error completions are deferred to s_dio_done_wq.  This
  means the workqueue also needs to be allocated for async reads.
