aliases: []
summary: 'Keystone is a headless CMS for Node.js — built with GraphQL and React.`@keystone-6/core@3.0.0
  || 3.0.1` users that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger security-sensitive functionality in their production
  builds are vulnerable to `NODE_ENV` being inlined to `"development"` for user code, irrespective
  of what your environment variables. If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger
  security-sensitive functionality, you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies
  that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors (optimizations, security or otherwise)
  should still respect your environment''s configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application''s
  dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not
  compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption
  by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when
  using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2, regression
  tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063.'
