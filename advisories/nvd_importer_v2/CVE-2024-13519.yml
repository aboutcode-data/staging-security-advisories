summary: The MarketKing — Ultimate WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin's settings in all versions up to,
  and including, 1.9.80 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level permissions and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has
  been disabled.
