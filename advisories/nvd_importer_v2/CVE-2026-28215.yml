aliases: []
summary: hoppscotch is an open source API development ecosystem. Prior to version 2026.2.0,
  an unauthenticated attacker can overwrite the entire infrastructure configuration of a self-hosted
  Hoppscotch instance including OAuth provider credentials and SMTP settings  by sending a single
  HTTP POST request with no authentication. The endpoint POST /v1/onboarding/config has no authentication
  guard and performs no check on whether onboarding was already completed. A successful exploit
  allows the attacker to replace the instance's Google/GitHub/Microsoft OAuth application credentials
  with their own, causing all subsequent user logins via SSO to authenticate against the attacker's
  OAuth app. The attacker captures OAuth tokens and email addresses of every user who logs in
  after the exploit. Additionally, the endpoint returns a recovery token that can be used to
  read all stored secrets in plaintext, including SMTP passwords and any other configured credentials.
  Version 2026.2.0 fixes the issue.
