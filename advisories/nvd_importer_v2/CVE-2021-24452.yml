aliases: []
summary: The W3 Total Cache WordPress plugin before 2.1.5 was affected by a reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) issue within the "extension" parameter in the Extensions dashboard, when the
  'Anonymously track usage to improve product quality' setting is enabled, as the parameter
  is output in a JavaScript context without proper escaping. This could allow an attacker, who
  can convince an authenticated admin into clicking a link, to run malicious JavaScript within
  the user's web browser, which could lead to full site compromise.
