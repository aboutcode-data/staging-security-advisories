summary: The Directorist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an arbitrary user password reset
  in versions up to, and including, 7.5.4. This is due to a lack of validation checks within
  login.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions
  and above, to reset the password of an arbitrary user and gain elevated (e.g., administrator)
  privileges.
