  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/vmwgfx: Fix a deadlock in dma buf fence polling

  Introduce a version of the fence ops that on release doesn't remove
  the fence from the pending list, and thus doesn't require a lock to
  fix poll->fence wait->fence unref deadlocks.

  vmwgfx overwrites the wait callback to iterate over the list of all
  fences and update their status, to do that it holds a lock to prevent
  the list modifcations from other threads. The fence destroy callback
  both deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending
  fences, for which it holds a lock.

  dma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll
  calls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.
  The destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list
  which it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it
  was called.

  Old bug, but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling
  interfaces. Fix those, in particular this fixes KDE stalls/deadlock.
