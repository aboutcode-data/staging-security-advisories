  fs/ntfs3: Fix NULL dereference in ni_write_inode

  Syzbot reports a NULL dereference in ni_write_inode.
  When creating a new inode, if allocation fails in mi_init function
  (called in mi_format_new function), mi->mrec is set to NULL.
  In the error path of this inode creation, mi->mrec is later
  dereferenced in ni_write_inode.

  Add a NULL check to prevent NULL dereference.
