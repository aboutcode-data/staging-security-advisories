aliases: []
summary: 'snd_ctl_elem_add in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.3 has a count=info->owner
  line, which later affects a private_size*count multiplication for unspecified "interesting
  side effects." NOTE: kernel engineers dispute this finding, because it could be relevant only
  if new callers were added that were unfamiliar with the misuse of the info->owner field to
  represent data unrelated to the "owner" concept. The existing callers, SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD
  and SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE, have been designed to misuse the info->owner field in a
  safe way'
