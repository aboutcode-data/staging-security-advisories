aliases: []
summary: tinymce is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  was discovered in the alert and confirm dialogs when these dialogs were provided with malicious
  HTML content. This can occur in plugins that use the alert or confirm dialogs, such as in
  the `image` plugin, which presents these dialogs when certain errors occur. The vulnerability
  allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an alert presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current
  user. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.7 and TinyMCE 6.3.1 by ensuring
  HTML sanitization was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements. Users are advised
  to upgrade to either 5.10.7 or 6.3.1. Users unable to upgrade may ensure the the `images_upload_handler`
  returns a valid value as per the images_upload_handler documentation.
