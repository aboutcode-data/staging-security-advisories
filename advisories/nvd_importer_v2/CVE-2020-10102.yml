aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Zammad 3.0 through 3.2. The Forgot Password functionality
  is implemented in a way that would enable an anonymous user to guess valid user emails. In
  the current implementation, the application responds differently depending on whether the
  input supplied was recognized as associated with a valid user. This behavior could be used
  as part of a two-stage automated attack. During the first stage, an attacker would iterate
  through a list of account names to determine which correspond to valid accounts. During the
  second stage, the attacker would use a list of common passwords to attempt to brute force
  credentials for accounts that were recognized by the system in the first stage.
