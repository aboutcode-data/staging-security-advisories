  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/sched: sch_fq: fix integer overflow of "credit"

  if sch_fq is configured with "initial quantum" having values greater than
  INT_MAX, the first assignment of "credit" does signed integer overflow to
  a very negative value.
  In this situation, the syzkaller script provided by Cristoph triggers the
  CPU soft-lockup warning even with few sockets. It's not an infinite loop,
  but "credit" wasn't probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow.
  Capping "initial quantum" to INT_MAX proved to fix the issue.

  v2: validation of "initial quantum" is done in fq_policy, instead of open
      coding in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski
