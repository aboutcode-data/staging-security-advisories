aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability exists in the 'dagre-d3-es' Node.js package version 7.0.9, specifically
  within the 'bk' module's addConflict function, which fails to properly sanitize user-supplied
  input during property assignment operations. This flaw allows attackers to exploit prototype
  pollution vulnerabilities by injecting malicious input values (e.g., "__proto__"), enabling
  unauthorized modification of the JavaScript Object prototype chain. Successful exploitation
  could lead to denial of service conditions, unexpected application behavior, or potential
  execution of arbitrary code in contexts where polluted properties are later accessed or executed.
  The issue affects versions prior to 7.0.11 and remains unpatched at the time of disclosure.
