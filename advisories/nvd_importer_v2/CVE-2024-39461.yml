summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: bcm: rpi: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws

  Commit f316cdff8d67 ("clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with
  __counted_by") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'
  with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number
  of elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of
  bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must be
  initialized with the number of elements before the first array access
  happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the
  initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in
  raspberrypi_discover_clocks() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws
  has been accessed:

    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c:374:4
    index 3 is out of range for type 'struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num)' (aka 'struct clk_hw *[]')

  Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, which
  clears up the warning.
