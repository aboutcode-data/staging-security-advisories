aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in libsoup, an HTTP client library. This vulnerability, known as CRLF
  (Carriage Return Line Feed) Injection, occurs when an HTTP proxy is configured and the library
  improperly handles URL-decoded input used to create the Host header. A remote attacker can
  exploit this by providing a specially crafted URL containing CRLF sequences, allowing them
  to inject additional HTTP headers or complete HTTP request bodies. This can lead to unintended
  or unauthorized HTTP requests being forwarded by the proxy, potentially impacting downstream
  services.
