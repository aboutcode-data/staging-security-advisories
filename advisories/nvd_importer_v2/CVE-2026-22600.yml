summary: 'OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. A Local File
  Read (LFR) vulnerability exists in the work package PDF export functionality of OpenProject
  prior to version 16.6.4. By uploading a specially crafted SVG file (disguised as a PNG) as
  a work package attachment, an attacker can exploit the backend image processing engine (ImageMagick).
  When the work package is exported to PDF, the backend attempts to resize the image, triggering
  the ImageMagick text: coder. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files that the
  application user has permissions to access (e.g., /etc/passwd, all project configuration files,
  private project data, etc.). The attack requires permissions to upload attachments to a container
  that can be exported to PDF, such as a work package. The issue has been patched in version
  16.6.4. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply the patch manually.'
