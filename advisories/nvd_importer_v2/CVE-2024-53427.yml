aliases: []
summary: decNumberCopy in decNumber.c in jq through 1.7.1 does not properly consider that NaN
  is interpreted as numeric, which has a resultant stack-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds
  write, as demonstrated by use of --slurp with subtraction, such as a filter of .-. when the
  input has a certain form of digit string with NaN (e.g., "1 NaN123" immediately followed by
  many more digits).
