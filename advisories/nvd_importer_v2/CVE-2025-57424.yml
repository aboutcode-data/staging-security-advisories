aliases: []
summary: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the MyCourts v3 application
  within the LTA number profile field. An attacker can insert arbitrary JavaScript into their
  profile, which executes in the browser of any user viewing it, including administrators. Due
  to the absence of the HttpOnly flag on the session cookie, this flaw could be exploited to
  capture session tokens and hijack user sessions, enabling elevated access.
