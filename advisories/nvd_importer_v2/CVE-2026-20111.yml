summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)\
  \ attack against users of the interface of an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists\
  \ because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code into specific data\
  \ fields in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based\
  \ information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid administrative credentials."
