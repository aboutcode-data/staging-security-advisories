aliases: []
summary: The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically
  in the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization.
  The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from
  a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with
  access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration
  of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN,
  AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow
  file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.
