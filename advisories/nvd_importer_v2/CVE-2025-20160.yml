aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the implementation of the TACACS+ protocol in Cisco IOS Software\
  \ and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive\
  \ data or bypass authentication. \r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the system does\
  \ not properly check whether the required TACACS+ shared secret is configured. A machine-in-the-middle\
  \ attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting and reading unencrypted TACACS+\
  \ messages or impersonating the TACACS+ server and falsely accepting arbitrary authentication\
  \ requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in\
  \ a TACACS+ message or bypass authentication and gain access to the affected device."
