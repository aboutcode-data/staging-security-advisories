aliases: []
summary: Hail is an open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis tool with additional
  data types and methods for working with genomic data. Hail relies on OpenID Connect (OIDC)
  email addresses from ID tokens to verify the validity of a user's domain, but because users
  have the ability to change their email address, they could create accounts and use resources
  in clusters that they should not have access to. For example, a user could create a Microsoft
  or Google account and then change their email to `test@example.org`. This account can then
  be used to create a Hail Batch account in Hail Batch clusters whose organization domain is
  `example.org`. The attacker is not able to access private data or impersonate another user,
  but they would have the ability to run jobs if Hail Batch billing projects are enabled and
  create Azure Tenants if they have Azure Active Directory Administrator access.
