summary: The Request a Quote Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
  in version less than, or equal to, 2.5.2 via the emd_form_builder_lite_pagenum function. This
  is due to the plugin not properly validating user input before using it as a function name.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server, however,
  parameters can not be passed to the functions called.
