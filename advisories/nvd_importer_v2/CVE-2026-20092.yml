summary: "A vulnerability in the read-only maintenance shell of Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance\
  \ could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrative privileges to elevate privileges\
  \ to root on the virtual appliance.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper file permissions\
  \ on configuration files for system accounts within the maintenance shell of the virtual appliance.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the maintenance shell as a read-only\
  \ administrator and manipulating system files to grant root privileges. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges to&nbsp;root on the virtual appliance\
  \ and gain full control of the appliance, giving them the ability to access sensitive information,\
  \ modify workloads and configurations on the host system, and cause a denial of service (DoS)."
