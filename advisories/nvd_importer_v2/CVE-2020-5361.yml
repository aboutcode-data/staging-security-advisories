aliases: []
summary: Select Dell Client Commercial and Consumer platforms support a BIOS password reset
  capability that is designed to assist authorized customers who forget their passwords. Dell
  is aware of unauthorized password generation tools that can generate BIOS recovery passwords.
  The tools, which are not authorized by Dell, can be used by a physically present attacker
  to reset BIOS passwords and BIOS-managed Hard Disk Drive (HDD) passwords. An unauthenticated
  attacker with physical access to the system could potentially exploit this vulnerability to
  bypass security restrictions for BIOS Setup configuration, HDD access and BIOS pre-boot authentication.
