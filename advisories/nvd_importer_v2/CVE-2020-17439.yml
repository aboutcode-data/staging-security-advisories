aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and other products. The
  code that parses incoming DNS packets does not validate that the incoming DNS replies match
  outgoing DNS queries in newdata() in resolv.c. Also, arbitrary DNS replies are parsed if there
  was any outgoing DNS query with a transaction ID that matches the transaction ID of an incoming
  reply. Provided that the default DNS cache is quite small (only four records) and that the
  transaction ID has a very limited set of values that is quite easy to guess, this can lead
  to DNS cache poisoning.
