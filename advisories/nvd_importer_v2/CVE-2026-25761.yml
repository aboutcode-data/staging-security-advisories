aliases: []
summary: Super-linter is a combination of multiple linters to run as a GitHub Action or standalone.
  From 6.0.0 to 8.3.0, the Super-linter GitHub Action is vulnerable to command injection via
  crafted filenames. When this action is used in downstream GitHub Actions workflows, an attacker
  can submit a pull request that introduces a file whose name contains shell command substitution
  syntax, such as $(...). In affected Super-linter versions, runtime scripts may execute the
  embedded command during file discovery processing, enabling arbitrary command execution in
  the workflow runner context. This can be used to disclose the job’s GITHUB_TOKEN depending
  on how the workflow configures permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.3.1.
