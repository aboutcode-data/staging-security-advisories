  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  afs: Fix the setting of the server responding flag

  In afs_wait_for_operation(), we set transcribe the call responded flag to
  the server record that we used after doing the fileserver iteration loop -
  but it's possible to exit the loop having had a response from the server
  that we've discarded (e.g. it returned an abort or we started receiving
  data, but the call didn't complete).

  This means that op->server might be NULL, but we don't check that before
  attempting to set the server flag.
