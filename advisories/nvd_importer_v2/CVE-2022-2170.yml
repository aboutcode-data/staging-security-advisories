aliases: []
summary: The Microsoft Advertising Universal Event Tracking (UET) WordPress plugin before 1.0.4
  does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to
  perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.
  Due to the nature of this plugin, well crafted XSS can also leak into the frontpage.
