aliases: []
summary: Versions of the Amazon AWS Apache Log4j hotpatch package before log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch-1.3.5
  are affected by a race condition that could lead to a local privilege escalation. This Hotpatch
  package is not a replacement for updating to a log4j version that mitigates CVE-2021-44228
  or CVE-2021-45046; it provides a temporary mitigation to CVE-2021-44228 by hotpatching the
  local Java virtual machines. To do so, it iterates through all running Java processes, performs
  several checks, and executes the Java virtual machine with the same permissions and capabilities
  as the running process to load the hotpatch. A local user could cause the hotpatch script
  to execute a binary with elevated privileges by running a custom java process that performs
  exec() of an SUID binary after the hotpatch has observed the process path and before it has
  observed its effective user ID.
