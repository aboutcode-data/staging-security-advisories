aliases: []
summary: |
  When sealing/unsealing the “vault” key, a list of PCRs is used, which defines which PCRs
  are used.

  In a previous project, CYMOTIVE found that the configuration is not protected by the secure
  boot, and in response Zededa implemented measurements on the config partition that was
  mapped to PCR 13.

  In that process, PCR 13 was added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key.

  In commit “56e589749c6ff58ded862d39535d43253b249acf”, the config partition
  measurement moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14, but PCR 14 was not added to the list of
  PCRs that seal/unseal the key.

  This change makes the measurement of PCR 14 effectively redundant as it would not affect
  the sealing/unsealing of the key.



  An attacker could modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot, this could
  result in the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents of the
  encrypted “vault”
