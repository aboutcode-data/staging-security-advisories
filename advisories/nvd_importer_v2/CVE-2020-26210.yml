aliases: []
summary: In BookStack before version 0.30.4, a user with permissions to edit a page could add
  an attached link which would execute untrusted JavaScript code when clicked by a viewer of
  the page. Dangerous content may remain in the database after this update. If you think this
  could have been exploited the linked advisory provides a SQL query to test. As a workaround,
  page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade
  although this will not address existing exploitation of this vulnerability. The issue is fixed
  in version 0.30.4.
