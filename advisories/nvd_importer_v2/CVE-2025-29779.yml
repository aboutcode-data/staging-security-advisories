summary: Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation
  of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `secure_redundant_execution`
  function in feldman_vss.py attempts to mitigate fault injection attacks by executing a function
  multiple times and comparing results. However, several critical weaknesses exist. Python's
  execution environment cannot guarantee true isolation between redundant executions, the constant-time
  comparison implementation in Python is subject to timing variations, the randomized execution
  order and timing provide insufficient protection against sophisticated fault attacks, and
  the error handling may leak timing information about partial execution results. These limitations
  make the protection ineffective against targeted fault injection attacks, especially from
  attackers with physical access to the hardware. A successful fault injection attack could
  allow an attacker to bypass the redundancy check mechanisms, extract secret polynomial coefficients
  during share generation or verification, force the acceptance of invalid shares during verification,
  and/or manipulate the commitment verification process to accept fraudulent commitments. This
  undermines the core security guarantees of the Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme. As of time
  of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing
  exist, but other mitigations are available. Long-term remediation requires reimplementing
  the security-critical functions in a lower-level language like Rust. Short-term mitigations
  include deploying the software in environments with physical security controls, increasing
  the redundancy count (from 5 to a higher number) by modifying the source code, adding external
  verification of cryptographic operations when possible, considering using hardware security
  modules (HSMs) for key operations.
