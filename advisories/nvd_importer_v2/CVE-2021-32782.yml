summary: Nextcloud Circles is an open source social network built for the nextcloud ecosystem.
  In affected versions the Nextcloud Circles application is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud,
  this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is
  recommended that the Nextcloud Circles application is upgraded to 0.21.3, 0.20.10 or 0.19.14
  to resolve this issue. As a workaround users may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.
  A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.
