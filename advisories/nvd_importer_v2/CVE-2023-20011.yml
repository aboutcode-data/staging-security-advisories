aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure
  Controller (APIC) and Cisco Cloud Network Controller, formerly Cisco Cloud APIC, could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack
  on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the
  web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.
  If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying
  the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.
