aliases: []
summary: CRE Loaded before 6.2.14, and possibly other versions before 6.3.x, allows remote attackers
  to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges via a request with (1) login.php
  or (2) password_forgotten.php appended as the PATH_INFO, which bypasses a check that uses
  PHP_SELF, which is not properly handled by (a) includes/application_top.php and (b) admin/includes/application_top.php,
  as exploited in the wild in 2009.
