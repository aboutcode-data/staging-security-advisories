aliases: []
summary: Silverstripe Framework is a PHP framework which powers the Silverstripe CMS. In some
  cases, form messages can contain HTML markup. This is an intentional feature, allowing links
  and other relevant HTML markup for the given message. Some form messages include content that
  the user can provide. There are scenarios in the CMS where that content doesn't get correctly
  sanitised prior to being included in the form message, resulting in an XSS vulnerability.
  This issue has been addressed in silverstripe/framework version 5.3.8 and users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
