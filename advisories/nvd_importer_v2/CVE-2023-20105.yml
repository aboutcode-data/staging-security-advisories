summary: "A vulnerability in the change password functionality of Cisco Expressway Series and\
  \ Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote\
  \ attacker with Read-only credentials to elevate privileges to Administrator on an affected\
  \ system.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of password change requests.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a Read-only\
  \ user and sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an\
  \ administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\r\n\r Note: Cisco Expressway Series\
  \ refers to the Expressway Control (Expressway-C) device and the Expressway Edge (Expressway-E)\
  \ device."
