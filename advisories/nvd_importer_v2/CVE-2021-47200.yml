  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/prime: Fix use after free in mmap with drm_gem_ttm_mmap

  drm_gem_ttm_mmap() drops a reference to the gem object on success. If
  the gem object's refcount == 1 on entry to drm_gem_prime_mmap(), that
  drop will free the gem object, and the subsequent drm_gem_object_get()
  will be a UAF. Fix by grabbing a reference before calling the mmap
  helper.

  This issue was forseen when the reference dropping was adding in
  commit 9786b65bc61ac ("drm/ttm: fix mmap refcounting"):
    "For that to work properly the drm_gem_object_get() call in
    drm_gem_ttm_mmap() must be moved so it happens before calling
    obj->funcs->mmap(), otherwise the gem refcount would go down
    to zero."
