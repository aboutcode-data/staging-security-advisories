summary: A low-privileged attacker can remotely access the PKI folder of the CODESYS Control
  runtime system and thus read and write certificates and its keys. This allows sensitive data
  to be extracted or to accept certificates as trusted. Although all services remain available,
  only unencrypted communication is possible if the certificates are deleted.
