aliases: []
summary: Spark's Apache Maven-based build includes a convenience script, 'build/mvn', that downloads
  and runs a zinc server to speed up compilation. It has been included in release branches since
  1.3.x, up to and including master. This server will accept connections from external hosts
  by default. A specially-crafted request to the zinc server could cause it to reveal information
  in files readable to the developer account running the build. Note that this issue does not
  affect end users of Spark, only developers building Spark from source code.
