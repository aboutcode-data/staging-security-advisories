aliases: []
summary: wger is a free, open-source workout and fitness manager. In versions up to and including
  2.4, `RepetitionsConfigViewSet` and `MaxRepetitionsConfigViewSet` return all users' repetition
  config data because their `get_queryset()` calls `.all()` instead of filtering by the authenticated
  user. Any registered user can enumerate every other user's workout structure. Commit 1fda5690b35706bb137850c8a084ec6a13317b64
  contains a fix for the issue.
