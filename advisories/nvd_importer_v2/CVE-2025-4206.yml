summary: The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner — Groundhogg
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path
  validation in the 'process_export_delete' and 'process_import_delete' functions in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
  code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
