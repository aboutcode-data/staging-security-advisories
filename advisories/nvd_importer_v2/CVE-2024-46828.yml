  sched: sch_cake: fix bulk flow accounting logic for host fairness

  In sch_cake, we keep track of the count of active bulk flows per host,
  when running in dst/src host fairness mode, which is used as the
  round-robin weight when iterating through flows. The count of active
  bulk flows is updated whenever a flow changes state.

  This has a peculiar interaction with the hash collision handling: when a
  hash collision occurs (after the set-associative hashing), the state of
  the hash bucket is simply updated to match the new packet that collided,
  and if host fairness is enabled, that also means assigning new per-host
  state to the flow. For this reason, the bulk flow counters of the
  host(s) assigned to the flow are decremented, before new state is
  assigned (and the counters, which may not belong to the same host
  anymore, are incremented again).

  Back when this code was introduced, the host fairness mode was always
  enabled, so the decrement was unconditional. When the configuration
  flags were introduced the *increment* was made conditional, but
  the *decrement* was not. Which of course can lead to a spurious
  decrement (and associated wrap-around to U16_MAX).

  AFAICT, when host fairness is disabled, the decrement and wrap-around
  happens as soon as a hash collision occurs (which is not that common in
  itself, due to the set-associative hashing). However, in most cases this
  is harmless, as the value is only used when host fairness mode is
  enabled. So in order to trigger an array overflow, sch_cake has to first
  be configured with host fairness disabled, and while running in this
  mode, a hash collision has to occur to cause the overflow. Then, the
  qdisc has to be reconfigured to enable host fairness, which leads to the
  array out-of-bounds because the wrapped-around value is retained and
  used as an array index. It seems that syzbot managed to trigger this,
  which is quite impressive in its own right.

  This patch fixes the issue by introducing the same conditional check on
  decrement as is used on increment.

  The original bug predates the upstreaming of cake, but the commit listed
  in the Fixes tag touched that code, meaning that this patch won't apply
  before that.
