summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md/raid5: fix possible null-pointer dereferences in raid5_store_group_thread_cnt()

  The variable mddev->private is first assigned to conf and then checked:

    conf = mddev->private;
    if (!conf) ...

  If conf is NULL, then mddev->private is also NULL. In this case,
  null-pointer dereferences can occur when calling raid5_quiesce():

    raid5_quiesce(mddev, true);
    raid5_quiesce(mddev, false);

  since mddev->private is assigned to conf again in raid5_quiesce(), and conf
  is dereferenced in several places, for example:

    conf->quiesce = 0;
    wake_up(&conf->wait_for_quiescent);

  To fix this issue, the function should unlock mddev and return before
  invoking raid5_quiesce() when conf is NULL, following the existing pattern
  in raid5_change_consistency_policy().
