summary: An issue was discovered in Webmin 2.021. A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Bypass vulnerability
  was discovered in the file upload functionality. Normally, the application restricts the upload
  of certain file types such as .svg, .php, etc., and displays an error message if a prohibited

  and inject malicious code.
