aliases: []
summary: pnpm is a package manager. Versions 10.26.2 and below store HTTP tarball dependencies
  (and git-hosted tarballs) in the lockfile without integrity hashes. This allows the remote
  server to serve different content on each install, even when a lockfile is committed. An attacker
  who publishes a package with an HTTP tarball dependency can serve different code to different
  users or CI/CD environments. The attack requires the victim to install a package that has
  an HTTP/git tarball in its dependency tree. The victim's lockfile provides no protection.
  This issue is fixed in version 10.26.0.
