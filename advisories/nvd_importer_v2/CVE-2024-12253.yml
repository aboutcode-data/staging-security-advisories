summary: The Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the 'save_settings',
  'export_csv', and 'simpleecommcart-action' actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
  to update the plugins settings and retrieve order and log data (which is also accessible to
  unauthenticated users).
