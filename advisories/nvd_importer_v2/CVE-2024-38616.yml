  wifi: carl9170: re-fix fortified-memset warning

  The carl9170_tx_release() function sometimes triggers a fortified-memset
  warning in my randconfig builds:

  In file included from include/linux/string.h:254,
                   from drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:40:
  In function 'fortify_memset_chk',
      inlined from 'carl9170_tx_release' at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:283:2,
      inlined from 'kref_put' at include/linux/kref.h:65:3,
      inlined from 'carl9170_tx_put_skb' at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c:342:9:
  include/linux/fortify-string.h:493:25: error: call to '__write_overflow_field' declared with attribute warning: detected write beyond size of field (1st parameter); maybe use struct_group()? [-Werror=attribute-warning]
    493 |                         __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size);

  Kees previously tried to avoid this by using memset_after(), but it seems
  this does not fully address the problem. I noticed that the memset_after()
  here is done on a different part of the union (status) than the original
  cast was from (rate_driver_data), which may confuse the compiler.

  Unfortunately, the memset_after() trick does not work on driver_rates[]
  because that is part of an anonymous struct, and I could not get
  struct_group() to do this either. Using two separate memset() calls
  on the two members does address the warning though.
