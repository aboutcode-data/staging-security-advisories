aliases: []
summary: The Altair theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that
  can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check within functions.php in
  all versions up to, and including, 5.2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default
  role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain
  administrative user access to a vulnerable site.
