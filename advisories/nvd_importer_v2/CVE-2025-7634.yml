summary: The WP Travel Engine – Tour Booking Plugin – Tour Operator Software plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.7 via the
  mode parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute

  This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution
  in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.
