aliases: []
summary: Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives. A DLL hijacking
  vulnerability in Rufus 4.6.2208 and earlier versions allows an attacker loading and executing
  a malicious DLL with escalated privileges (since the executable has been granted higher privileges
  during the time of launch) due to the ability to inject a malicious `cfgmgr32.dll` in the
  same directory as the executable and have it side load automatically. This is fixed in commit
  `74dfa49`, which will be part of version 4.7. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as version
  4.7 becomes available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
