summary: 'Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in index.php in phpBP RC3 (2.204) and earlier
  allows remote administrators to inject arbitrary PHP code into an upload/banners/ file via
  a banners add operation that uploads the PHP code through an image_form parameter specifying
  a multiple-extension filename such as .jpg.vil.gif.php, which is stored in upload/banners/
  under a different name, and executable via a direct request.  NOTE: a separate SQL injection
  issue could be leveraged to make this vulnerability reachable by remote unauthenticated attackers.'
