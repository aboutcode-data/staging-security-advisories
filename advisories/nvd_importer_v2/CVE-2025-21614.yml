aliases: []
summary: go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. A denial
  of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability
  allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses
  from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Users running versions
  of go-git from v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to v5.13 in order to mitigate this
  vulnerability.
