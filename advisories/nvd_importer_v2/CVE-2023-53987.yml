summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ping: Fix potentail NULL deref for /proc/net/icmp.

  After commit dbca1596bbb0 ("ping: convert to RCU lookups, get rid
  of rwlock"), we use RCU for ping sockets, but we should use spinlock
  for /proc/net/icmp to avoid a potential NULL deref mentioned in
  the previous patch.

  Let's go back to using spinlock there.

  Note we can convert ping sockets to use hlist instead of hlist_nulls
  because we do not use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU for ping sockets.
