aliases: []
summary: '`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the `node_modules`
  folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
  contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into
  the expected folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency specifiers defined
  in `package.json` manifests for dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to
  resolve conflicting dependencies. When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their
  name, Arborist''s internal data structure saw them as separate items that could coexist within
  the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy. However, on case-insensitive file systems
  (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined with a symlink dependency such
  as `file:/some/path`, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in which arbitrary contents
  could be written to any location on the filesystem. For example, a package `pwn-a` could define
  a dependency in their `package.json` file such as `"foo": "file:/some/path"`. Another package,
  `pwn-b` could define a dependency such as `FOO: "file:foo.tgz"`. On case-insensitive file
  systems, if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the contents
  of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existing contents of `/some/path` would
  be removed. Anyone using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially
  affected. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.'
