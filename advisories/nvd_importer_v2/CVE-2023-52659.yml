  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/mm: Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit type

  On 64-bit platforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the input
  value is 64 bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't get
  lost when shifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physical
  address to provide a virtual address for.

  One such example is in pvalidate_pages() (used by SEV-SNP guests), where
  the GFN in the struct used for page-state change requests is a 40-bit
  bit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN field directly into
  pfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealing with addresses
  above the 1TB range due to the above.

  Fix this issue with SEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases that
  might cause issues in current/future code, by using an inline function,
  instead of a macro, so that the input is implicitly cast to the
  expected 64-bit input type prior to performing the shift operation.

  While it might be argued that the issue is on the caller side, other
  archs/macros have taken similar approaches to deal with instances like
  this, such as ARM explicitly casting the input to phys_addr_t:

    e48866647b48 ("ARM: 8396/1: use phys_addr_t in pfn_to_kaddr()")

  A C inline function is even better though.

  [ mingo: Refined the changelog some more & added __always_inline. ]
