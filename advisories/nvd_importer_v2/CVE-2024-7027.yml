summary: The WooCommerce - PDF Vouchers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
  bypass in versions up to, and including, 4.9.3. This is due to insufficient verification on
  the user being supplied during a QR code login through the plugin. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing Voucher Vendor user on the site, if
  they have access to the user id.
