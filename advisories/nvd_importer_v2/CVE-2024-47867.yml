aliases: []
summary: Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability
  is a **lack of integrity check** on the downloaded FRP client, which could potentially allow
  attackers to introduce malicious code. If an attacker gains access to the remote URL from
  which the FRP client is downloaded, they could modify the binary without detection, as the
  Gradio server does not verify the file's checksum or signature.  Any users utilizing the Gradio
  server's sharing mechanism that downloads the FRP client could be affected by this vulnerability,
  especially those relying on the executable binary for secure data tunneling. There is no direct
  workaround for this issue without upgrading. However, users can manually validate the integrity
  of the downloaded FRP client by implementing checksum or signature verification in their own
  environment to ensure the binary hasn't been tampered with.
