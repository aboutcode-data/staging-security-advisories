aliases: []
summary: user_oidc is the OIDC connect user backend for Nextcloud, an open source collaboration
  platform. A vulnerability in versions 1.0.0 until 1.3.0 effectively allowed an attacker to
  bypass the state protection as they could just copy the expected state token from the first
  request to their second request. Users should upgrade user_oidc to 1.3.0 to receive a patch
  for the issue. No known workarounds are available.
