aliases: []
summary: The Appointmind plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the plugin's 'appointmind_calendar' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.0
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
