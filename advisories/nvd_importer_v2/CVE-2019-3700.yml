aliases: []
summary: yast2-security didn't use secure defaults to protect passwords. This became a problem
  on 2019-10-07 when configuration files that set secure settings were moved to a different
  location. As of the 20191022 snapshot the insecure default settings were used until yast2-security
  switched to stronger defaults in 4.2.6 and used the new configuration file locations. Password
  created during this time used DES password encryption and are not properly protected against
  attackers that are able to access the password hashes.
