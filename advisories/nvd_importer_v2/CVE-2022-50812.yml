aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  security: Restrict CONFIG_ZERO_CALL_USED_REGS to gcc or clang > 15.0.6

  A bad bug in clang's implementation of -fzero-call-used-regs can result
  in NULL pointer dereferences (see the links above the check for more
  information). Restrict CONFIG_CC_HAS_ZERO_CALL_USED_REGS to either a
  supported GCC version or a clang newer than 15.0.6, which will catch
  both a theoretical 15.0.7 and the upcoming 16.0.0, which will both have
  the bug fixed.
