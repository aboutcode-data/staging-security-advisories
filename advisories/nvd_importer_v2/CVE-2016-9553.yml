aliases: []
summary: The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection
  vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in
  the MgrReport.php (/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and unblocking
  IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't properly escape the information
  passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function
  which allows for system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously suggests
  that the information handled is protected by utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' - however
  this was not the case. The Sophos ID is NSWA-1258.
