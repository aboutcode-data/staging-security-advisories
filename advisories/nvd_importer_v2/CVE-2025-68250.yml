  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hung_task: fix warnings caused by unaligned lock pointers

  The blocker tracking mechanism assumes that lock pointers are at least
  4-byte aligned to use their lower bits for type encoding.

  However, as reported by Eero Tamminen, some architectures like m68k
  only guarantee 2-byte alignment of 32-bit values. This breaks the
  assumption and causes two related WARN_ON_ONCE checks to trigger.

  To fix this, the runtime checks are adjusted to silently ignore any lock
  that is not 4-byte aligned, effectively disabling the feature in such
  cases and avoiding the related warnings.

  Thanks to Geert Uytterhoeven for bisecting!
