  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: Protect against int overflow for stack access size

  This patch re-introduces protection against the size of access to stack
  memory being negative; the access size can appear negative as a result
  of overflowing its signed int representation. This should not actually
  happen, as there are other protections along the way, but we should
  protect against it anyway. One code path was missing such protections
  (fixed in the previous patch in the series), causing out-of-bounds array
  accesses in check_stack_range_initialized(). This patch causes the
  verification of a program with such a non-sensical access size to fail.

  This check used to exist in a more indirect way, but was inadvertendly
  removed in a833a17aeac7.
