aliases: []
summary: Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.2 and 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a deserialization of
  untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 11. Any user wishing to protect against
  deserialization attacks involving JMX or RMI should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15. Use of 1.15
  on Java 11 will automatically protect JMX over RMI against deserialization attacks. This should
  have no impact on performance since it only affects JMX/RMI which Gfsh uses to communicate
  with the JMX Manager which is hosted on a Locator.
