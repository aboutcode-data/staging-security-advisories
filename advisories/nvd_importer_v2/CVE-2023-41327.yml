aliases: []
summary: "WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. WireMock can be configured to only permit\
  \ proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of\
  \ allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated\
  \ first. \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15, the filtering of target addresses\
  \ from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable\
  \ regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration,\
  \ POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s\
  \ instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private\
  \ cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against\
  \ secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers.\
  \ This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio\
  \ has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external\
  \ firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations."
