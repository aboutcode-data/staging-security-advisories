  wifi: mac80211: Discard Beacon frames to non-broadcast address

  Beacon frames are required to be sent to the broadcast address, see IEEE
  Std 802.11-2020, 11.1.3.1 ("The Address 1 field of the Beacon .. frame
  shall be set to the broadcast address"). A unicast Beacon frame might be
  used as a targeted attack to get one of the associated STAs to do
  something (e.g., using CSA to move it to another channel). As such, it
  is better have strict filtering for this on the received side and
  discard all Beacon frames that are sent to an unexpected address.

  This is even more important for cases where beacon protection is used.
  The current implementation in mac80211 is correctly discarding unicast
  Beacon frames if the Protected Frame bit in the Frame Control field is
  set to 0. However, if that bit is set to 1, the logic used for checking
  for configured BIGTK(s) does not actually work. If the driver does not
  have logic for dropping unicast Beacon frames with Protected Frame bit
  1, these frames would be accepted in mac80211 processing as valid Beacon
  frames even though they are not protected. This would allow beacon
  protection to be bypassed. While the logic for checking beacon
  protection could be extended to cover this corner case, a more generic
  check for discard all Beacon frames based on A1=unicast address covers
  this without needing additional changes.

  Address all these issues by dropping received Beacon frames if they are
  sent to a non-broadcast address.
