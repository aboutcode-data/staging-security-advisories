aliases: []
summary: Umbraco Engage is a business intelligence platform. A vulnerability has been identified
  in Umbraco Engage prior to versions 16.2.1 and 17.1.1 where certain API endpoints are exposed
  without enforcing authentication or authorization checks. The affected endpoints can be accessed
  directly over the network without requiring a valid session or user credentials. By supplying
  a user-controlled identifier parameter (e.g., ?id=), an attacker can retrieve sensitive data
  associated with arbitrary records. Because no access control validation is performed, the
  endpoints are vulnerable to enumeration attacks, allowing attackers to iterate over identifiers
  and extract data at scale. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive Engage-related
  data by directly querying the affected API endpoints. The vulnerability allows arbitrary record
  access through predictable or enumerable identifiers. The confidentiality impact is considered
  high. No direct integrity or availability impact has been identified. The scope of exposed
  data depends on the deployment but may include analytics data, tracking data, customer-related
  information, or other Engage-managed content. The vulnerability affects both v16 and v17.
  Patches have already been released. Users are advised to update to 16.2.1 or 17.1.1. No known
  workarounds are available.
