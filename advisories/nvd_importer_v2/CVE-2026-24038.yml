aliases: []
summary: Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). In version
  1.4.0, the OTP handling logic has a flawed equality check that can be bypassed. When an OTP
  expires, the server returns None, and if an attacker omits the otp field from their POST request,
  the user-supplied OTP is also None, causing the comparison user_otp == otp to pass. This allows
  an attacker to bypass two-factor authentication entirely without ever providing a valid OTP.
  If administrative accounts are targeted, it could lead to compromise of sensitive HR data,
  manipulation of employee records, and further system-wide abuse. This issue has been fixed
  in version 1.5.0.
