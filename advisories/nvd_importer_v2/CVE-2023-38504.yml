summary: Sails is a realtime MVC Framework for Node.js. In Sails apps prior to version 1.5.7,,
  an attacker can send a virtual request that will cause the node process to crash. This behavior
  was fixed in Sails v1.5.7. As a workaround, disable the sockets hook and remove the `sails.io.js`
  client.
