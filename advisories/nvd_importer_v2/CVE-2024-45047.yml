aliases: []
summary: svelte performance oriented web framework. A potential mXSS vulnerability exists in
  Svelte for versions up to but not including 4.2.19. Svelte improperly escapes HTML on server-side
  rendering. The assumption is that attributes will always stay as such, but in some situation
  the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Svelte expects on server-side
  rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as
  mXSS (mutation XSS). More specifically, this can occur when injecting malicious content into
  an attribute within a `noscript` tag. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.2.19.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
