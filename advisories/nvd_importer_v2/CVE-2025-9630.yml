summary: The WP SinoType plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the sinotype_config function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify
  typography settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
