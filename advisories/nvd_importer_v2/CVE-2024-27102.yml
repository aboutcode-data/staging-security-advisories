aliases: []
summary: Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. This vulnerability impacts
  anyone running the affected versions of Wings. The vulnerability can potentially be used to
  access files and directories on the host system. The full scope of impact is exactly unknown,
  but reading files outside of a server's base directory (sandbox root) is possible. In order
  to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing "server" allocated and controlled by
  Wings. Details on the exploitation of this vulnerability are embargoed until March 27th, 2024
  at 18:00 UTC. In order to mitigate this vulnerability, a full rewrite of the entire server
  filesystem was necessary. Because of this, the size of the patch is massive, however effort
  was made to reduce the amount of breaking changes. Users are advised to update to version
  1.11.9. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
