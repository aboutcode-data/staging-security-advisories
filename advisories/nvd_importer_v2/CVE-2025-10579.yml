aliases: []
summary: The BackWPup – WordPress Backup & Restore Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'backwpup_working'
  AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 5.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve access to a back-up's filename
  while a backup is running. This information has little value on it's own, but could be used
  to aid in a brute force attack to retrieve back-up contents in limited environments (i.e.
  NGINX).
