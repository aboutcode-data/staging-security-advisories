summary: The authentication system of Securepoint UTM mishandles OTP keys. This allows the bypassing
  of second-factor verification (when OTP is enabled) in both the administration web interface
  and the user portal. Affected versions include UTM 11.5 through 12.6.4 and Reseller Preview
  12.7.0. The issue has been fixed in UTM 12.6.5 and 12.7.1.
