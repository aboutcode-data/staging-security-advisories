  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: ch341: fix out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one

  Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

  The 'len' variable is calculated as 'min(32, trans->len + 1)',
  which includes the 1-byte command header.

  When copying data from 'trans->tx_buf' to 'ch341->tx_buf + 1', using 'len'
  as the length is incorrect because:

  1. It causes an out-of-bounds read from 'trans->tx_buf' (which has size
     'trans->len', i.e., 'len - 1' in this context).
  2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to 'ch341->tx_buf' if 'len' is
     CH341_PACKET_LENGTH (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341->tx_buf + 1
     overflows the buffer.

  Fix this by copying 'len - 1' bytes.
