  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  soundwire: cadence: fix invalid PDI offset

  For some reason, we add an offset to the PDI, presumably to skip the
  PDI0 and PDI1 which are reserved for BPT.

  This code is however completely wrong and leads to an out-of-bounds
  access. We were just lucky so far since we used only a couple of PDIs
  and remained within the PDI array bounds.

  A Fixes: tag is not provided since there are no known platforms where
  the out-of-bounds would be accessed, and the initial code had problems
  as well.

  A follow-up patch completely removes this useless offset.
