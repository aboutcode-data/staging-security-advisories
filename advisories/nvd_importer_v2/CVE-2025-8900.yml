aliases: []
summary: The Doccure Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions
  up to, and excluding, 1.5.4. This is due to the plugin allowing users who are registering
  new accounts to set their own role or by supplying 'user_type' field. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the
  administrator role.
