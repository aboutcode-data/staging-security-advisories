aliases: []
summary: 'Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate was entitled
  to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate allowed access to everything
  in the infrastructure. When a node''s catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog
  can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can
  be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet
  master. Puppet 6.13.0 and 5.5.19 changes the default behavior for strict_hostname_checking
  from false to true. It is recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users
  that are not upgrading still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior.
  Affected software versions: Puppet 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet Agent 6.x prior to 6.13.0 Puppet
  5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.x prior to 5.5.19 Resolved in: Puppet 6.13.0 Puppet
  Agent 6.13.0 Puppet 5.5.19 Puppet Agent 5.5.19'
