summary: A flaw was found when using mirror-registry to install Quay. It uses a default secret,
  which is stored in plain-text format in one of the configuration template files. This issue
  may lead to all instances of Quay deployed using mirror-registry to have the same secret key.
  This flaw allows a malicious actor to craft session cookies and as a consequence, it may lead
  to gaining access to the affected Quay instance.
