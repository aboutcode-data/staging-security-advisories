aliases: []
summary: In Saml2 Authentication Services for ASP.NET versions before 1.0.2, and between 2.0.0
  and 2.6.0, there is a vulnerability in how tokens are validated in some cases. Saml2 tokens
  are usually used as bearer tokens - a caller that presents a token is assumed to be the subject
  of the token. There is also support in the Saml2 protocol for issuing tokens that is tied
  to a subject through other means, e.g. holder-of-key where possession of a private key must
  be proved. The Sustainsys.Saml2 library incorrectly treats all incoming tokens as bearer tokens,
  even though they have another subject confirmation method specified. This could be used by
  an attacker that could get access to Saml2 tokens with another subject confirmation method
  than bearer. The attacker could then use such a token to create a log in session. This vulnerability
  is patched in versions 1.0.2 and 2.7.0.
