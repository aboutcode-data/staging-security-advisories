  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  exfat: add cluster chain loop check for dir

  An infinite loop may occur if the following conditions occur due to
  file system corruption.

  (1) Condition for exfat_count_dir_entries() to loop infinitely.
      - The cluster chain includes a loop.
      - There is no UNUSED entry in the cluster chain.

  (2) Condition for exfat_create_upcase_table() to loop infinitely.
      - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.
      - There are no UNUSED entry and up-case table entry in the cluster
        chain of the root directory.

  (3) Condition for exfat_load_bitmap() to loop infinitely.
      - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.
      - There are no UNUSED entry and bitmap entry in the cluster chain
        of the root directory.

  (4) Condition for exfat_find_dir_entry() to loop infinitely.
      - The cluster chain includes a loop.
      - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.

  (5) Condition for exfat_check_dir_empty() to loop infinitely.
      - The cluster chain includes a loop.
      - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.
      - All files and sub-directories under the directory are deleted.

  This commit adds checks to break the above infinite loop.
