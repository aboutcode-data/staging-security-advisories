summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: esd_usb: esd_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak

  Fix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").

  In esd_usb_open(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to
  the dev->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the complete callback
  esd_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and resubmitted. In
  esd_usb_close() the URBs are freed by calling
  usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&dev->rx_submitted).

  However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
  the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
  in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
  released in esd_usb_close().

  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the
  esd_usb_read_bulk_callback() to the dev->rx_submitted anchor.
