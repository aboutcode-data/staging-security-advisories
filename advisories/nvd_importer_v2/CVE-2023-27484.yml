aliases: []
summary: crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes controllers in
  Crossplane and its related stacks. In affected versions an already highly privileged user
  able to create or update Compositions can specify an arbitrarily high index in a patch's `ToFieldPath`,
  which could lead to excessive memory usage once such Composition is selected for a Composite
  resource. Compositions allow users to specify patches inserting elements into arrays at an
  arbitrary index. When a Composition is selected for a Composite Resource, patches are evaluated
  and if a specified index is greater than the current size of the target slice, Crossplane
  will grow that slice up to the specified index, which could lead to an excessive amount of
  memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The index is already capped to the maximum
  value for a uint32 (4294967295) when parsed, but that is still an unnecessarily large value.
  This issue has been addressed in versions 1.11.2, 1.10.3, and 1.9.2. Users are advised to
  upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can restrict write privileges on Compositions to only admin
  users as a workaround.
