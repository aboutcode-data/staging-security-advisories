summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dlm: fix dlm_recover_members refcount on error

  If dlm_recover_members() fails we don't drop the references of the
  previous created root_list that holds and keep all rsbs alive during the
  recovery. It might be not an unlikely event because ping_members() could
  run into an -EINTR if another recovery progress was triggered again.
