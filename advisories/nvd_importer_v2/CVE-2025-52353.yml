aliases: []
summary: An arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Badaso CMS 2.9.11. The Media Manager allows
  authenticated users to upload files containing embedded PHP code via the file-upload endpoint,
  bypassing content-type validation. When such a file is accessed via its URL, the server executes
  the PHP payload, enabling an attacker to run arbitrary system commands and achieve full compromise
  of the underlying host. This has been demonstrated by embedding a backdoor within a PDF and
  renaming it with a .php extension.
