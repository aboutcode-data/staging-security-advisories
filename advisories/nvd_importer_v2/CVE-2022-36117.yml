aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured
  environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated
  user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for an administrative
  function. If credential access is configured to be accessible by a machine or the runtime
  resource security group, using further reverse engineering, an attacker can spoof a known
  machine and request known encrypted credentials to decrypt later.
