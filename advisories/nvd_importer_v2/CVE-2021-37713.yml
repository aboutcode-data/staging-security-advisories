aliases: []
summary: The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has
  an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar
  aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory
  is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within
  the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized
  paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems
  when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified
  a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\path`. If the drive letter
  does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\extraction\dir`, then the result of
  `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory
  on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion
  of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not
  properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions
  of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed
  in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did
  not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you
  update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this
  issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users
  are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt
  to sanitize paths themselves.
