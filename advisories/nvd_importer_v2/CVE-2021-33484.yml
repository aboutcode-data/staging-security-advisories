aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in CommentsService.ashx in OnyakTech Comments Pro 3.8. An attacker
  can download a copy of the installer, decompile it, and discover a hardcoded IV used to encrypt
  the username and userid in the comment POST request. Additionally, the attacker can decrypt
  the encrypted encryption key (sent as a parameter in the comment form request) by setting
  this encrypted value as the username, which will appear on the comment page in its decrypted
  form. Using these two values (combined with the encryption functionality discovered in the
  decompiled installer), the attacker can encrypt another user's ID and username. These values
  can be used as part of the comment posting request in order to spoof the user.
