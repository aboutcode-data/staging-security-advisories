aliases: []
summary: During a routine security analysis, it was found that one of the ports in Apache Impala
  (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 sent data in plaintext even when the cluster was configured to
  use TLS. The port in question was used by the StatestoreSubscriber class which did not use
  the appropriate secure Thrift transport when TLS was turned on. It was therefore possible
  for an adversary, with access to the network, to eavesdrop on the packets going to and coming
  from that port and view the data in plaintext.
