  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix race in hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once

  hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once() does lookup and then cancel
  the entry under two separate lock sections. Meanwhile,
  hci_cmd_sync_work() can also delete the same entry,
  leading to double list_del() and "UAF".

  Fix this by holding cmd_sync_work_lock across both
  lookup and cancel, so that the entry cannot be removed
  concurrently.
