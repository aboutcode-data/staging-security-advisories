summary: Warehouse Management System 1.2 contains an authenticated arbitrary file deletion vulnerability.
  The /goods/deleteGoods endpoint accepts a user-controlled goodsimg parameter, which is directly
  concatenated with the server's UPLOAD_PATH and passed to File.delete() without validation.
  A remote authenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server by supplying directory
  traversal payloads.
