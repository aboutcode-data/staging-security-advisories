summary: The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an
  arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims
  to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
  This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally,
  in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory,
  paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting
  tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory,
  where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator
  on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\` and `/` characters as path separators,
  however `\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory,
  and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar
  symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into
  an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus
  allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise
  on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed
  by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the
  symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal
  directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within
  the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that
  the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8
  and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these
  issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version
  of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.
