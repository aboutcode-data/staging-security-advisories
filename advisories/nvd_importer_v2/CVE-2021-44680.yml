aliases: []
summary: An issue (4 of 6) was discovered in Veritas Enterprise Vault through 14.1.2. On start-up,
  the Enterprise Vault application starts several services that listen on random .NET Remoting
  TCP ports for possible commands from client applications. These TCP services can be exploited
  due to deserialization behavior that is inherent to the .NET Remoting service. A malicious
  attacker can exploit both TCP remoting services and local IPC services on the Enterprise Vault
  Server. This vulnerability is mitigated by properly configuring the servers and firewall as
  described in the vendor's security alert for this vulnerability (VTS21-003, ZDI-CAN-14075).
