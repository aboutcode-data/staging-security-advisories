aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Player for Windows and MacOS could allow an attacker
  to cause the affected software to terminate or to gain access to memory state information
  that is related to the vulnerable application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
  of values in Webex recording files that are stored in Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious WRF file to a user as a link or email
  attachment and then persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the
  local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the affected software
  and view memory state information.
