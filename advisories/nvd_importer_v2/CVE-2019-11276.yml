aliases: []
summary: Pivotal Apps Manager, included in Pivotal Application Service versions 2.3.x prior
  to 2.3.16, 2.4.x prior to 2.4.12, 2.5.x prior to 2.5.8, and 2.6.x prior to 2.6.3, makes a
  request to the /cloudapplication endpoint via Spring actuator, and subsequent requests via
  unsecured http. An adjacent unauthenticated user could eavesdrop on the network traffic and
  gain access to the unencrypted token allowing the attacker to read the type of access a user
  has over an app. They may also modify the logging level, potentially leading to lost information
  that would otherwise have been logged.
