aliases: []
summary: gorilla/schema converts structs to and from form values. Prior to version 1.4.1 Running
  `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of type `[]struct{...}` opens it up
  to malicious attacks regarding memory allocations, taking advantage of the sparse slice functionality.
  Any use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other structs could be vulnerable
  to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. Version 1.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.
