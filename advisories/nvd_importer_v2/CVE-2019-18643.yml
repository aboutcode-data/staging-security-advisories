aliases: []
summary: Rock RMS versions before 8.10 and versions 9.0 through 9.3 fails to properly validate
  files uploaded in the application. The only protection mechanism is a file-extension blacklist
  that can be bypassed by adding multiple spaces and periods after the file name. This could
  allow an attacker to upload ASPX code and gain remote code execution on the application. The
  application typically runs as LocalSystem as mandated in the installation guide. Patched in
  versions 8.10 and 9.4.
