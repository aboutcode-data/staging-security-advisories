aliases: []
summary: Minder is a software supply chain security platform. Prior to version 0.0.50, Minder
  engine is susceptible to a denial of service from memory exhaustion that can be triggered
  from maliciously created templates. Minder engine uses templating to generate strings for
  various use cases such as URLs, messages for pull requests, descriptions for advisories. In
  some cases can the user control both the template and the params for it, and in a subset of
  these cases, Minder reads the generated template entirely into memory. When Minders templating
  meets both of these conditions, an attacker is able to generate large enough templates that
  Minder will exhaust memory and crash. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.50.
