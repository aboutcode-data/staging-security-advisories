summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gfs2: Check sb_bsize_shift after reading superblock

  Fuzzers like to scribble over sb_bsize_shift but in reality it's very
  unlikely that this field would be corrupted on its own. Nevertheless it
  should be checked to avoid the possibility of messy mount errors due to
  bad calculations. It's always a fixed value based on the block size so
  we can just check that it's the expected value.

  Tested with:

      mkfs.gfs2 -O -p lock_nolock /dev/vdb
      for i in 0 -1 64 65 32 33; do
          gfs2_edit -p sb field sb_bsize_shift $i /dev/vdb
          mount /dev/vdb /mnt/test && umount /mnt/test
      done

  Before this patch we get a withdraw after

  [   76.413681] gfs2: fsid=loop0.0: fatal: invalid metadata block
  [   76.413681]   bh = 19 (type: exp=5, found=4)
  [   76.413681]   function = gfs2_meta_buffer, file = fs/gfs2/meta_io.c, line = 492

  and with UBSAN configured we also get complaints like

  [   76.373395] UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/gfs2/ops_fstype.c:295:19
  [   76.373815] shift exponent 4294967287 is too large for 64-bit type 'long unsigned int'

  After the patch, these complaints don't appear, mount fails immediately
  and we get an explanation in dmesg.
