aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations
  of xhyve. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the
  target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within
  the e1000 virtual device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length
  of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage
  this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the
  hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-15056.
