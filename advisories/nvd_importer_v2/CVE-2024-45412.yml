aliases: []
summary: Yeti bridges the gap between CTI and DFIR practitioners by providing a Forensics Intelligence
  platform and pipeline. Remote user-controlled data tags can reach a Unicode normalization
  with a compatibility form NFKD. Under Windows, such normalization is costly in resources and
  may lead to denial of service with attacks such as One Million Unicode payload. This can get
  worse with the use of special Unicode characters like U+2100 (℀), or U+2105 (℅) which could
  lead the payload size to be tripled. Versions prior to 2.1.11 are affected by this vulnerability.
  The patch is included in 2.1.11.
