aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows a low-privileged user with certain
  roles to perform remote code execution (RCE) by updating existing jobs. These jobs can be
  configured to run pre- and post-scripts, which can be located on a network share and are executed
  with elevated privileges by default. The user can update a job and schedule it to run almost
  immediately, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.
