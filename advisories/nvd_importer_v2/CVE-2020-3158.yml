aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the High Availability (HA) service of Cisco Smart Software Manager
  On-Prem could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a sensitive part of the
  system with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability is due to a system account that has
  a default and static password and is not under the control of the system administrator. An
  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the
  affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read and write access
  to system data, including the configuration of an affected device. The attacker would gain
  access to a sensitive portion of the system, but the attacker would not have full administrative
  rights to control the device.
