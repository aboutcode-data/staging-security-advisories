aliases: []
summary: kartverket/github-workflows are shared reusable workflows for GitHub Actions. Prior
  to version 2.7.5, all users of the `run-terraform` reusable workflow from the kartverket/github-workflows
  repo are affected by a code injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could potentially send
  a PR with a malicious payload leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context
  of the workflow. Users should upgrade to at least version 2.7.5 to resolve the issue. As a
  workaround, review any pull requests from external users for malicious payloads before allowing
  them to trigger a build.
