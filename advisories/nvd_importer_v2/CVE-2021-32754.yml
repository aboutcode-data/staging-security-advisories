aliases: []
summary: FlowDroid is a data flow analysis tool. FlowDroid versions prior to 2.9.0 contained
  an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that allowed an attacker who had control over the
  source/sink definition file in XML format to read files from external locations. In order
  for this to occur, the XML-based format for sources and sinks had to be used and the attacker
  had to able control the source/sink definition file. The vulnerability was patched in version
  2.9.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted entities to control the source/sink definition
  file.
