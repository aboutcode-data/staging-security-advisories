aliases: []
summary: The FormBuilder WordPress plugin through 1.08 does not have CSRF checks in place when
  creating/updating and deleting forms, and does not sanitise as well as escape its form field
  values. As a result, attackers could make logged in admin update and delete arbitrary forms
  via a CSRF attack, and put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them.
