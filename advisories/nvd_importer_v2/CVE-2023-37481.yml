aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data privacy requests
  and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service
  (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload zip files containing malicious
  SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser
  tabs and creating a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`).
  This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited
  to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes
  root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version
  `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against
  this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.
