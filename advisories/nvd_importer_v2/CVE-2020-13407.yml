aliases: []
summary: Tufin SecureTrack < R20-2 GA contains reflected + stored XSS (as in, the value is reflected
  back to the user, but is also stored within the DB and can be later triggered again by the
  same victim, or also later by different users). Both stored, and reflected payloads are triggerable
  by admin, so malicious non-authenticated user could get admin level access. Even malicious
  low-privileged user can inject XSS, which can be executed by admin, potentially elevating
  privileges and obtaining admin access. (issue 1 of 3)
