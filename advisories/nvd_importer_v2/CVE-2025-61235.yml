summary: An issue was discovered in Dataphone A920 v2025.07.161103. A custom packet based on
  public documentation can be crafted, where some fields can contain arbitrary or trivial data.
  Normally, such data should cause the device to reject the packet. However, due to a lack of
  validation, the device accepts it with no authetication and triggers the functionality instead.
