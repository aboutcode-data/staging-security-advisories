aliases: []
summary: user_oidc provides the OIDC connect user backend for Nextcloud, an open-source cloud
  platform. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, missing verification of the
  issuer would have allowed an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack returning corrupted
  or known token they also have access to. user_oidc 1.3.3 contains a patch. No known workarounds
  are available.
