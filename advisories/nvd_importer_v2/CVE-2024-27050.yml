  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query()

  When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf
  bpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro.
  This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means
  that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller
  size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by
  libbpf writing out of bounds.

  The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the
  feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS)
  macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this
  fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()
  macro.
