aliases: []
summary: SAP Commerce (Backoffice) uses the deprecated X-FRAME-OPTIONS header to protect against
  clickjacking. While this protection remains effective now, it may not be the case in the future
  as browsers might discontinue support for this header in favor of the frame-ancestors CSP
  directive. Hence, clickjacking could become possible then, and lead to exposure and modification
  of sensitive information.
