aliases: []
summary: '`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The library allows
  the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are
  available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow.
  fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a
  URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will
  cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of
  service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
  unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options.'
