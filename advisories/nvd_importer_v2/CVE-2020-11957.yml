aliases: []
summary: The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation in Cypress PSoC Creator BLE 4.2 component versions
  before 3.64 generates a random number (Pairing Random) with significantly less entropy than
  the specified 128 bits during BLE pairing. This is the case for both authenticated and unauthenticated
  pairing with both LE Secure Connections as well as LE Legacy Pairing. A predictable or brute-forceable
  random number allows an attacker (in radio range) to perform a MITM attack during BLE pairing.
