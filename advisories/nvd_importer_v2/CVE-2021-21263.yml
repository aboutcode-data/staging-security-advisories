aliases: []
summary: Laravel is a web application framework. Versions of Laravel before 6.20.11, 7.30.2
  and 8.22.1 contain a query binding exploitation. This same exploit applies to the illuminate/database
  package which is used by Laravel. If a request is crafted where a field that is normally a
  non-array value is an array, and that input is not validated or cast to its expected type
  before being passed to the query builder, an unexpected number of query bindings can be added
  to the query. In some situations, this will simply lead to no results being returned by the
  query builder; however, it is possible certain queries could be affected in a way that causes
  the query to return unexpected results.
