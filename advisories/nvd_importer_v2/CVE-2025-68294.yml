summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/net: ensure vectored buffer node import is tied to notification

  When support for vectored registered buffers was added, the import
  itself is using 'req' rather than the notification io_kiocb, sr->notif.
  For non-vectored imports, sr->notif is correctly used. This is important
  as the lifetime of the two may be different. Use the correct io_kiocb
  for the vectored buffer import.
