aliases: []
summary: Parsec is a cloud-based application for cryptographically secure file sharing. In versions
  on the 3.x branch prior to 3.6.0, `libparsec_crypto`, a component of the Parsec application,
  does not check for weak order point of Curve25519 when compiled with its RustCrypto backend.
  In practice this means an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position would be able to provide
  weak order points to both parties in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, resulting in a high probability
  to for both parties to obtain the same shared key (hence leading to a successful SAS code
  exchange, misleading both parties into thinking no MITM has occurred) which is also known
  by the attacker. Note only Parsec web is impacted (as Parsec desktop uses `libparsec_crypto`
  with the libsodium backend). Version 3.6.0 of Parsec patches the issue.
