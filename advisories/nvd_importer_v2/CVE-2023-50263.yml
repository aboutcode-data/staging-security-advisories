summary: "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web\
  \ application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. In Nautobot\
  \ 1.x and 2.0.x prior to 1.6.7 and 2.0.6, the URLs `/files/get/?name=...` and `/files/download/?name=...`\
  \ are used to provide admin access to files that have been uploaded as part of a run request\
  \ for a Job that has FileVar inputs. Under normal operation these files are ephemeral and\
  \ are deleted once the Job in question runs. \n\nIn the default implementation used in Nautobot,\
  \ as provided by `django-db-file-storage`, these URLs do not by default require any user authentication\
  \ to access; they should instead be restricted to only users who have permissions to view\
  \ Nautobot's `FileProxy` model instances.\n\nNote that no URL mechanism is provided for listing\
  \ or traversal of the available file `name` values, so in practice an unauthenticated user\
  \ would have to guess names to discover arbitrary files for download, but if a user knows\
  \ the file name/path value, they can access it without authenticating, so we are considering\
  \ this a vulnerability.\n\nFixes are included in Nautobot 1.6.7 and Nautobot 2.0.6. No known\
  \ workarounds are available other than applying the patches included in those versions."
