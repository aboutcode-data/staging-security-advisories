summary: GE Mark VIe Controller is shipped with pre-configured hard-coded credentials that may
  allow root-user access to the controller. A limited application of the affected product may
  ship without setup and configuration instructions immediately available to the end user. The
  bulk of controllers go into applications requiring the GE commissioning engineer to change
  default configurations during the installation process. GE recommends that users reset controller
  passwords during installation in the operating environment.
