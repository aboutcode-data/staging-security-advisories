aliases: []
summary: Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows credential disclosure, as exploited in the wild in July
  2021. By default Kaseya VSA on premise offers a download page where the clients for the installation
  can be downloaded. The default URL for this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp When an attacker
  download a client for Windows and installs it, the file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\Program
  Files (x86)\Kaseya\XXXXXXXXXX\KaseyaD.ini) which contains an Agent_Guid and AgentPassword
  This Agent_Guid and AgentPassword can be used to log in on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a4077a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9)
  This request authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can be used in subsequent
  attacks to bypass authentication. Security issues discovered --- * Unauthenticated download
  page leaks credentials * Credentials of agent software can be used to obtain a sessionId (cookie)
  that can be used for services not intended for use by agents * dl.asp accepts credentials
  via a GET request * Access to KaseyaD.ini gives an attacker access to sufficient information
  to penetrate the Kaseya installation and its clients. Impact --- Via the page /dl.asp enough
  information can be obtained to give an attacker a sessionId that can be used to execute further
  (semi-authenticated) attacks against the system.
