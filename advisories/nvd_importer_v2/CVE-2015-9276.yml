summary: SmarterTools SmarterMail before 13.3.5535 was vulnerable to stored XSS by bypassing
  the anti-XSS mechanisms. It was possible to run JavaScript code when a victim user opens or
  replies to the attacker's email, which contained a malicious payload. Therefore, users' passwords
  could be reset by using an XSS attack, as the password reset page did not need the current
  password.
