aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Glib's content type parsing logic. This buffer underflow vulnerability
  occurs because the length of a header line is stored in a signed integer, which can lead to
  integer wraparound for very large inputs. This results in pointer underflow and out-of-bounds
  memory access. Exploitation requires a local user to install or process a specially crafted
  treemagic file, which can lead to local denial of service or application instability.
