aliases: []
summary: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server.
  The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its
  function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying
  that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3,
  the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that
  also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify
  the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected
  as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx`
  should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to
  ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating
  the challenge transaction.
