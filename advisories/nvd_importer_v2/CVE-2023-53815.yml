summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  posix-timers: Prevent RT livelock in itimer_delete()

  itimer_delete() has a retry loop when the timer is concurrently expired. On
  non-RT kernels this just spin-waits until the timer callback has completed,
  except for posix CPU timers which have HAVE_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK
  enabled.

  In that case and on RT kernels the existing task could live lock when
  preempting the task which does the timer delivery.

  Replace spin_unlock() with an invocation of timer_wait_running() to handle
  it the same way as the other retry loops in the posix timer code.
