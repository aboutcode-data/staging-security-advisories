  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  seccomp: passthrough uretprobe systemcall without filtering

  When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside docker, the attached
  process is segfaulted when encountering the retprobe.

  The reason is that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp
  filters in docker block it as they only allow a specific set of known
  syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp
  to control their syscall surface.

  Since uretprobe is a "kernel implementation detail" system call which is
  not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and
  there's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to
  explicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.

  Pass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.

  Note: uretprobe is currently only x86_64 and isn't expected to ever be
  supported in i386.
