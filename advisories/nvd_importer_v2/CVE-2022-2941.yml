aliases: []
summary: The WP-UserOnline plugin for WordPress has multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities
  in versions up to, and including 2.88.0. This is due to the fact that all fields in the "Naming
  Conventions" section do not properly sanitize user input, nor escape it on output. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges, to inject JavaScript
  code into the setting that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This only
  affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
