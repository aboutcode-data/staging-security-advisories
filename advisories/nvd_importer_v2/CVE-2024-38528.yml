aliases: []
summary: nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the NTP and
  NTS protocols. There is a missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections. This allows an unauthenticated
  remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations,
  such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected. This vulnerability has been patched
  in version 1.1.3.
