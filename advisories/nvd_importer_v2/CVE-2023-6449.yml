datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6449
aliases: []
summary: The Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to insufficient file type validation in the 'validate' function and insufficient blocklisting
  on the 'wpcf7_antiscript_file_name' function in versions up to, and including, 5.8.3. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers with editor-level capabilities or above to upload
  arbitrary files on the affected site's server, but due to the htaccess configuration, remote
  code cannot be executed in most cases. By default, the file will be deleted from the server
  immediately. However, in some cases, other plugins may make it possible for the file to live
  on the server longer. This can make remote code execution possible when combined with another
  vulnerability, such as local file inclusion.
