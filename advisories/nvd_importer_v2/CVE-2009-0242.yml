aliases: []
summary: 'Rejected reason: gmetad in Ganglia 3.1.1, when supporting multiple requests per connection
  on an interactive port, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a request
  to the gmetad service with a path that does not exist, which causes Ganglia to (1) perform
  excessive CPU computation and (2) send the entire tree, which consumes network bandwidth.  NOTE:
  the vendor and original researcher have disputed this issue, since legitimate requests can
  generate the same amount of resource consumption.  CVE concurs with the dispute, so this identifier
  should not be used'
