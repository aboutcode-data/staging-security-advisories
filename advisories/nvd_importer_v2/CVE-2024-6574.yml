aliases: []
summary: The Laposta plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.12. This is due to the plugin not preventing direct access to several
  test files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path
  of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed
  is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an
  affected website. This plugin is no longer being maintained and has been closed for downloads.
