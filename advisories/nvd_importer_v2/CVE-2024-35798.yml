  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages()

  There are reports from tree-checker that detects corrupted nodes,
  without any obvious pattern so possibly an overwrite in memory.
  After some debugging it turns out there's a race when reading an extent
  buffer the uptodate status can be missed.

  To prevent concurrent reads for the same extent buffer,
  read_extent_buffer_pages() performs these checks:

      /* (1) */
      if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags))
          return 0;

      /* (2) */
      if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags))
          goto done;

  At this point, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Once
  that completes, end_bbio_meta_read() does

      /* (3) */
      set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);

      /* (4) */
      clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags);

  Normally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, and all other
  callers wait for it to finish before returning.  Unfortunately, there is
  a racey interleaving:

      Thread A | Thread B | Thread C
      ---------+----------+---------
         (1)   |          |
               |    (1)   |
         (2)   |          |
         (3)   |          |
         (4)   |          |
               |    (2)   |
               |          |    (1)

  When this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read. Worse, thread
  C will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while the read from
  thread B is still in progress.  This race could result in tree-checker
  errors like this as the extent buffer is concurrently modified:

      BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256
      block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356
      expect [256, 18446744073709551360]

  Fix it by testing UPTODATE again after setting the READING bit, and if
  it's been set, skip the unnecessary read.
