summary: MAS (Matrix Authentication Service) is a user management and authentication service
  for Matrix homeservers, written and maintained by Element. A logic flaw in matrix-authentication-service
  0.20.0 through 1.4.0 allows an attacker with access to an authenticated MAS session to perform
  sensitive operations without entering the current password. These include changing the current
  password, adding or removing an e-mail address and deactivating the account. The vulnerability
  only affects instances which have the local password database feature enabled (passwords section
  in the config). Patched in matrix-authentication-service 1.4.1.
