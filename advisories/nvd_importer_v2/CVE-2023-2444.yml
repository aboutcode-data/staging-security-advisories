aliases: []
summary: A cross site request forgery vulnerability exists in Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk
  Vantagepoint. This vulnerability can be exploited in two ways. If an attacker sends a malicious
  link to a computer that is on the same domain as the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint server and a
  user clicks the link, the attacker could impersonate the legitimate user and send requests
  to the affected product.  Additionally, if an attacker sends an untrusted link to a computer
  that is not on the same domain as the server and a user opens the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint
  website, enters credentials for the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint server, and clicks on the malicious
  link a cross site request forgery attack would be successful as well.
