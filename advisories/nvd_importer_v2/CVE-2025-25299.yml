aliases: []
summary: CKEditor 5 is a modern JavaScript rich-text editor with an MVC architecture. During
  a recent internal audit, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the
  CKEditor 5 real-time collaboration package. This vulnerability affects user markers, which
  represent users' positions within the document. It can lead to unauthorized JavaScript code
  execution, which might happen with a very specific editor and token endpoint configuration.
  This vulnerability affects only installations with Real-time collaborative editing enabled.
  The problem has been recognized and patched. The fix is available in version 44.2.1 (and above).
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
