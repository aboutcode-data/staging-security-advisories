aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Deepin dde-api-proxy through 1.0.19 in which unprivileged
  users can access D-Bus services as root. Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards
  messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services,
  and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root
  is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible
  to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved,
  the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges.
