aliases: []
summary: Android 6.0 has an authentication bypass for attackers with root and physical access.
  Cryptographic authentication tokens (AuthTokens) used by the Trusted Execution Environment
  (TEE) are protected by a weak challenge. This allows adversaries to replay previously captured
  responses and use the TEE without authenticating. All apps using authentication-gated cryptography
  are vulnerable to this attack, which was confirmed on the LG Nexus 5X.
