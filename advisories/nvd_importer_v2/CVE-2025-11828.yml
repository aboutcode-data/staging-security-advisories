aliases: []
summary: The Magazine Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'headerHtmlTag' attribute in the bnm-blocks/featured-posts-1 block in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  when using user-supplied values as HTML tag names. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
