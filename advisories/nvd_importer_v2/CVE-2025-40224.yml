summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hwmon: (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()

  The driver allocates memory for sensor data using devm_kzalloc(), but
  did not check if the allocation succeeded. In case of memory allocation
  failure, dereferencing the NULL pointer would lead to a kernel crash.

  Add a NULL pointer check and return -ENOMEM to handle allocation failure
  properly.
