aliases: []
summary: 'Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 relies on the XDomainRequestAllowed HTTP header
  to authorize data exchange between domains, which allows remote attackers to bypass the product''s
  XSS Filter protection mechanism, and conduct XSS and cross-domain attacks, by injecting this
  header after a CRLF sequence, related to "XDomainRequest Allowed Injection (XAI)." NOTE: the
  vendor has reportedly stated that the XSS Filter intentionally does not attempt to "address
  every conceivable XSS attack scenario."'
