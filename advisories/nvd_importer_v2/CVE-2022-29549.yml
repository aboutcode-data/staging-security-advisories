aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Qualys Cloud Agent 4.8.0-49. It executes programs at various
  full pathnames without first making ownership and permission checks (e.g., to help ensure
  that a program was installed by root) and without integrity checks (e.g., a checksum comparison
  against known legitimate programs). Also, the vendor recommendation is to install this agent
  software with root privileges. Thus, privilege escalation is possible on systems where any
  of these pathnames is controlled by a non-root user. An example is /opt/firebird/bin/isql,
  where the /opt/firebird directory is often owned by the firebird user.
