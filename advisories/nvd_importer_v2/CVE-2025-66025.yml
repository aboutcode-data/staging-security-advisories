summary: Caido is a web security auditing toolkit. Prior to version 0.53.0, the Markdown renderer
  used in Caido’s Findings page improperly handled user-supplied Markdown, allowing attacker-controlled
  links to be rendered without confirmation. When a user opened a finding generated through
  the scanner, or other plugins, clicking these injected links could redirect the Caido application
  to an attacker-controlled domain, enabling phishing style attacks. This issue has been patched
  in version 0.53.0.
