aliases: []
summary: Ibexa is a composable end-to-end DXP (Digital Experience Platform). Versions 5.0.0-beta1
  through 5.0.3 do not have password validation. During the transition from v4 to v5 an error
  was introduced into validation code which causes the validation of the previous password not
  to run as expected. This makes it possible for a logged in user to change their password in
  the back office without knowing the previous password. For example, if a user logs into their
  account and walks away without locking their workstation, an attacker could access the unattended
  session and change the password, therefore locking the legitimate user out. This issue is
  fixed in version 5.0.4.
