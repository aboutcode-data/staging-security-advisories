summary: 'A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Prime Infrastructure 2.2(2) could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  the user of the web interface of the affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  input validation of some parameters passed to the web server. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by convincing the user to access a malicious link or by intercepting the user
  request and injecting the malicious code. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive
  browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuw65830.'
