aliases: []
summary: Lightning Flow Scanner provides a A CLI plugin, VS Code Extension and GitHub Action
  for analysis and optimization of Salesforce Flows. Versions 6.10.5 and below allow a maliciously
  crafted flow metadata file to cause arbitrary JavaScript execution during scanning. The APIVersion
  rule uses new Function() to evaluate expression strings, enabling an attacker to supply a
  malicious expression within rule configuration or crafted flow metadata. This could compromise
  developer machines, CI runners, or editor environments. This issue is fixed in version 6.10.6.
