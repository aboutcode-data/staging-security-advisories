summary: 'Under certain circumstances a user''s password may be logged in cleartext in the PanGPS.log
  diagnostic file when logs are collected for troubleshooting on GlobalProtect app (also known
  as GlobalProtect Agent) for MacOS and Windows. For this issue to occur all of these conditions
  must be true: (1) ''Save User Credential'' option should be set to ''Yes'' in the GlobalProtect
  Portal''s Agent configuration, (2) the GlobalProtect user manually selects a gateway, (3)
  and the logging level is set to ''Dump'' while collecting troubleshooting logs. This issue
  does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms (for example iOS/Android/Linux). This
  issue affects GlobalProtect app 5.0 versions earlier than 5.0.9, GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions
  earlier than 5.1.2 on Windows or MacOS. Since becoming aware of the issue, Palo Alto Networks
  has safely deleted all the known GlobalProtectLogs zip files sent by customers with the credentials.
  We now filter and remove these credentials from all files sent to Customer Support. The GlobalProtectLogs
  zip files uploaded to Palo Alto Networks systems were only accessible by authorized personnel
  with valid Palo Alto Networks credentials. We do not have any evidence of malicious access
  or use of these credentials.'
