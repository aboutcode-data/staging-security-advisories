summary: LibreY is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting
  meta search engine. LibreY is subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
  in the `engines/google/text.php` and `engines/duckduckgo/text.php` files in versions before
  commit be59098abd119cda70b15bf3faac596dfd39a744. This vulnerability allows remote attackers
  to request the server to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and conduct Denial-of-Service
  (DoS) attacks via the `wikipedia_language` cookie. Remote attackers can request the server
  to download large files to reduce the performance of the server or even deny access from legitimate
  users. This issue has been patched in https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/9. LibreY hosters
  are advised to use the latest commit. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
