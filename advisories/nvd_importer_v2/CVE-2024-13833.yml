aliases: []
summary: The Album Gallery – WordPress Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
  Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3 via deserialization of untrusted input
  from gallery meta. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access
  and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software,
  which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP
  chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme
  installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary
  files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.
