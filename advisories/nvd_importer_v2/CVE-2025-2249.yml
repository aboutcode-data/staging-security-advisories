summary: The SoJ SoundSlides plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the soj_soundslides_options_subpanel() function in all

  with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
