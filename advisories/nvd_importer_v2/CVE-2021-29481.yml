aliases: []
summary: Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, the
  default configuration of client side sessions results in unencrypted, but signed, data being
  set as cookie values. This means that if something sensitive goes into the session, it could
  be read by something with access to the cookies. For this to be a vulnerability, some kind
  of sensitive data would need to be stored in the session and the session cookie would have
  to leak. For example, the cookies are not configured with httpOnly and an adjacent XSS vulnerability
  within the site allowed capture of the cookies. As of version 1.9.0, a securely randomly generated
  signing key is used. As a workaround, one may supply an encryption key, as per the documentation
  recommendation.
