aliases: []
summary: Strawberry GraphQL is a library for creating GraphQL APIs. Starting in 0.182.0 and
  prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay
  integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability
  occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the
  relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g.,
  FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped
  to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the
  alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate
  type contains data intended for restricted access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0.
