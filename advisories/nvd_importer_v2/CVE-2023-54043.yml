aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommufd: Do not add the same hwpt to the ioas->hwpt_list twice

  The hwpt is added to the hwpt_list only during its creation, it is never
  added again. This hunk is some missed leftover from rework. Adding it
  twice will corrupt the linked list in some cases.

  It effects HWPT specific attachment, which is something the test suite
  cannot cover until we can create a legitimate struct device with a
  non-system iommu "driver" (ie we need the bus removed from the iommu code)
