aliases: []
summary: The Data Services Management Console does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs,
  allowing an attacker to inject malicious script. When a targeted victim, who is already logged
  in, clicks on the compromised link, the injected script gets executed within the scope of
  victim�s browser. This potentially leads to an impact on confidentiality and integrity. Availability
  is not impacted.
