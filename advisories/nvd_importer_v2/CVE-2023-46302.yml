summary: "Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml.\
  \ The bug is caused by snakeyaml  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 .\n\nApache\
  \ Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to\nhandle YAML requests (using\
  \ application/yaml content-type), it defines\na YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will\
  \ process all incoming\nYAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method\n\
  is invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.\n\
  \ \nWe have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.\n\
  This issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0. Users are recommended to upgrade\
  \ to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.\nIf using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and\
  \ not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054\
  \  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this."
