  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  NFS: Fix LTP test failures when timestamps are delegated

  The utimes01 and utime06 tests fail when delegated timestamps are
  enabled, specifically in subtests that modify the atime and mtime
  fields using the 'nobody' user ID.

  The problem can be reproduced as follow:

  # echo "/media *(rw,no_root_squash,sync)" >> /etc/exports
  # export -ra
  # mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.2 127.0.0.1:/media /tmpdir
  # cd /opt/ltp
  # ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utimes01
  # ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utime06

  This issue occurs because nfs_setattr does not verify the inode's
  UID against the caller's fsuid when delegated timestamps are
  permitted for the inode.

  This patch adds the UID check and if it does not match then the
  request is sent to the server for permission checking.
