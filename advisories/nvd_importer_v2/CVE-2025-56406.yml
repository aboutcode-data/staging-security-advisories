aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in mcp-neo4j 0.3.0 allowing attackers to obtain sensitive
  information or execute arbitrary commands via the SSE service. NOTE: the Supplier''s position
  is that authentication is not mandatory for MCP servers, and the mcp-neo4j MCP server is only
  intended for use in a local environment where authentication realistically would not be needed.
  Also, the Supplier provides middleware to help isolate the MCP server from external access
  (if needed).'
