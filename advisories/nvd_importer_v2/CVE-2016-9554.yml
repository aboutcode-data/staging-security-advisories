aliases: []
summary: 'The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable
  to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities
  occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible
  for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn''t properly
  escape the information passed in the ''url'' variable before calling the executeCommand class
  function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user
  input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php,
  is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that
  calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the ''section'' parameter) is: ''configuration''.
  Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the ''spiderman''
  user account.'
