aliases: []
summary: An unauthenticated privilege escalation exists in SailPoint Desktop Password Reset
  7.2. A user with local access to only the Windows logon screen can escalate their privileges
  to NT AUTHORITY\System. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful
  exploit. The attacker must disconnect the computer from the local network / WAN and connect
  it to an internet facing access point / network. At that point, the attacker can execute the
  password-reset functionality, which will expose a web browser. Browsing to a site that calls
  local Windows system functions (e.g., file upload) will expose the local file system. From
  there an attacker can launch a privileged command shell.
