aliases: []
summary: The SVG Map Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on multiple AJAX actions including 'save_data', 'delete_data', and 'add_popup'. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings, delete map data,
  and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
