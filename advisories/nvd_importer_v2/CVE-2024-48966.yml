aliases: []
summary: The software tools used by service personnel to test & calibrate the ventilator do
  not support user authentication. An attacker with access to the Service PC where the tools
  are installed could obtain diagnostic information through the test tool or manipulate the
  ventilator's settings and embedded software via the calibration tool, without having to authenticate
  to either tool. This could result in unauthorized disclosure of information and/or have unintended
  impacts on device settings and performance.
