aliases: []
summary: Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. Prior to versions
  23.0.3 and 22.0.4, anyone with read/write access to the backup storage location (e.g. an S3
  bucket) can manipulate backup manifest files so that arbitrary code is later executed when
  that backup is restored. This can be used to provide that attacker with unintended/unauthorized
  access to the production deployment environment — allowing them to access information available
  in that environment as well as run any additional arbitrary commands there. Versions 23.0.3
  and 22.0.4 contain a patch. Some workarounds are available. Those who intended to use an external
  decompressor then can always specify that decompressor command in the `--external-decompressor`
  flag value for `vttablet` and `vtbackup`. That then overrides any value specified in the manifest
  file. Those who did not intend to use an external decompressor, nor an internal one, can specify
  a value such as `cat` or `tee` in the `--external-decompressor` flag value for `vttablet`
  and `vtbackup` to ensure that a harmless command is always used.
