aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in sunxi_divs_clk_setup in drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sunxi.c in
  the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might
  allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).
  NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because “The memory allocation that was not
  checked is part of a code that only runs at boot time, before user processes are started.
  Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of
  service.”'
