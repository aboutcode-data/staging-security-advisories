  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  serial: sc16is7xx: setup GPIO controller later in probe

  The GPIO controller component of the sc16is7xx driver is setup too
  early, which can result in a race condition where another device tries
  to utilise the GPIO lines before the sc16is7xx device has finished
  initialising.

  This issue manifests itself as an Oops when the GPIO lines are configured:

      Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address
      ...
      pc : sc16is7xx_gpio_direction_output+0x68/0x108 [sc16is7xx]
      lr : sc16is7xx_gpio_direction_output+0x4c/0x108 [sc16is7xx]
      ...

  This patch moves the setup of the GPIO controller functions to later in the
  probe function, ensuring the sc16is7xx device has already finished
  initialising by the time other devices try to make use of the GPIO lines.
  The error handling has also been reordered to reflect the new
  initialisation order.
