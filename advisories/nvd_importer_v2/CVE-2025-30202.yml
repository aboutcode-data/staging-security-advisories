aliases: []
summary: vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.
  Versions starting from 0.5.2 and prior to 0.8.5 are vulnerable to denial of service and data
  exposure via ZeroMQ on multi-node vLLM deployment. In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses
  ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ
  socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node
  deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client
  with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked
  by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted
  to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not
  useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading
  data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or
  potentially blocking the publisher. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.
