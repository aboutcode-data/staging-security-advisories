aliases: []
summary: OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open-source Observability
  framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as
  traces, metrics, logs. Autoinstrumentation out of the box adds the label `http_method` that
  has unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious
  requests are sent. HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random
  and long. In order to be affected program has to be instrumented for HTTP handlers and does
  not filter any unknown HTTP methods on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. This
  issue has been patched in version 0.41b0.
