summary: The certificate and private key used for providing transport layer security for connections
  to the web interface (TCP port 443) is hard-coded in the firmware and are shipped with the
  update files. An attacker can use the private key to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against
  users of the admin interface. The files are located in /etc/ssl (e.g. salia.local.crt, salia.local.key
  and salia.local.pem). There is no option to upload/configure custom TLS certificates.
