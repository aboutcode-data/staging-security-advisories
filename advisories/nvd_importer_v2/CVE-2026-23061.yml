  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: kvaser_usb: kvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak

  Fix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").

  In kvaser_usb_set_{,data_}bittiming() -> kvaser_usb_setup_rx_urbs(), the
  URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to the dev->rx_submitted
  anchor and submitted. In the complete callback
  kvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and resubmitted. In
  kvaser_usb_remove_interfaces() the URBs are freed by calling
  usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&dev->rx_submitted).

  However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
  the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
  in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
  released in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the
  kvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback() to the dev->rx_submitted anchor.
