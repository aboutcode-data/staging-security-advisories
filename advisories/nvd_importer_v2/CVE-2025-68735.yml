  drm/panthor: Prevent potential UAF in group creation

  This commit prevents the possibility of a use after free issue in the
  GROUP_CREATE ioctl function, which arose as pointer to the group is
  accessed in that ioctl function after storing it in the Xarray.
  A malicious userspace can second guess the handle of a group and try
  to call GROUP_DESTROY ioctl from another thread around the same time
  as GROUP_CREATE ioctl.

  To prevent the use after free exploit, this commit uses a mark on an
  entry of group pool Xarray which is added just before returning from
  the GROUP_CREATE ioctl function. The mark is checked for all ioctls
  that specify the group handle and so userspace won't be abe to delete
  a group that isn't marked yet.
