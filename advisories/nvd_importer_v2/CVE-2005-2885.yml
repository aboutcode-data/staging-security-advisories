summary: The Downloads page in MAXdev MD-Pro 1.0.73, and possibly earlier versions, uses an
  incomplete blacklist to check for dangerous file extensions, which could allow remote attackers
  to bypass file extension checks and execute arbitrary commands by uploading a file with a
  different extension, as demonstrated using .inc files.
