summary: 'Rejected reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This
  candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security
  issue. Notes: Red Hat Product Security does not consider this as a security flaw. Password
  changes aren''t expected to invalidate existing sessions. Though this is how Kerberos behaves:
  incrementing kvno will not invalidate any existing service tickets. This is not a concern
  because the lifetime on service tickets should be set appropriately (initially only a global,
  now also more finely configurable with the kdcpolicy plugin). This belief is reinforced by
  our use of mod_session: existing sessions there aren''t terminated, but instead wait for expiration'
