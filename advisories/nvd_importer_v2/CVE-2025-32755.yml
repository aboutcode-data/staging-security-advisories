aliases: []
summary: In jenkins/ssh-slave Docker images based on Debian, SSH host keys are generated on
  image creation for images based on Debian, causing all containers based on images of the same
  version use the same SSH host keys, allowing attackers able to insert themselves into the
  network path between the SSH client (typically the Jenkins controller) and SSH build agent
  to impersonate the latter.
