aliases: []
summary: Zammad 5.2.0 is vulnerable to privilege escalation. Zammad has a prevention against
  brute-force attacks trying to guess login credentials. After a configurable amount of attempts,
  users are invalidated and logins prevented. An attacker might work around this prevention,
  enabling them to send more than the configured amount of requests before the user invalidation
  takes place.
