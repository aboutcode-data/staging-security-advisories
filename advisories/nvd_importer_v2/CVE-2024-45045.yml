aliases: []
summary: Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology.
  In the mobile (Android/iOS) device variants of Collabora Online it was possible to inject
  JavaScript via url encoded values in links contained in documents. Since the Android JavaScript
  interface allows access to internal functions, the likelihood that the app could be compromised
  via this vulnerability is considered high. Non-mobile variants are not affected. Mobile variants
  should update to the latest version provided by the platform appstore. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
