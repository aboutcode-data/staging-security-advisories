summary: 'The Swatchly – WooCommerce Variation Swatches for Products (product attributes: Image
  swatch, Color swatches, Label swatches) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_dismiss function in versions
  1.2.8 to 1.4.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to update option values to 1/true on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged
  to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny access to legitimate users
  or be used to set some values to true, such as registration.'
