aliases: []
summary: The Database for Contact Form 7, WPforms, Elementor forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 via deserialization of
  untrusted input in the get_lead_detail function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain in the Contact Form
  7 plugin, which is likely to be used alongside, allows attackers to delete arbitrary files,
  leading to a denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.
