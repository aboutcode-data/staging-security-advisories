  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hugetlbfs: don't delete error page from pagecache

  This change is very similar to the change that was made for shmem [1], and
  it solves the same problem but for HugeTLBFS instead.

  Currently, when poison is found in a HugeTLB page, the page is removed
  from the page cache.  That means that attempting to map or read that
  hugepage in the future will result in a new hugepage being allocated
  instead of notifying the user that the page was poisoned.  As [1] states,
  this is effectively memory corruption.

  The fix is to leave the page in the page cache.  If the user attempts to
  use a poisoned HugeTLB page with a syscall, the syscall will fail with
  EIO, the same error code that shmem uses.  For attempts to map the page,
  the thread will get a BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS.

  [1]: commit a76054266661 ("mm: shmem: don't truncate page if memory failure happens")
