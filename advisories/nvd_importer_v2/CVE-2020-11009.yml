aliases: []
summary: In Rundeck before version 3.2.6, authenticated users can craft a request that reveals
  Execution data and logs and Job details that they are not authorized to see. Depending on
  the configuration and the way that Rundeck is used, this could result in anything between
  a high severity risk, or a very low risk. If access is tightly restricted and all users on
  the system have access to all projects, this is not really much of an issue. If access is
  wider and allows login for users that do not have access to any projects, or project access
  is restricted, there is a larger issue. If access is meant to be restricted and secrets, sensitive
  data, or intellectual property are exposed in Rundeck execution output and job data, the risk
  becomes much higher. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.6
