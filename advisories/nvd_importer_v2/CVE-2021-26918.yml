aliases: []
summary: 'The ProBot bot through 2021-02-08 for Discord might allow attackers to interfere with
  the intended purpose of the "Send an image when a user joins the server" feature (or possibly
  have unspecified other impact) because the uploader web service allows double extensions (such
  as .html.jpg) with the text/html content type. NOTE: there may not be cases in which an uploader
  web service is customer controlled; however, the nature of the issue has substantial interaction
  with customer controlled configuration. NOTE: the vendor states "This is just an uploader
  (like any other one) which uploads files to cloud storage and accepts various file types.
  There is no kind of vulnerability and it won''t compromise either the client side or the server
  side.'
