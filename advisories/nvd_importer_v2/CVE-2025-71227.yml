aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mac80211: don't WARN for connections on invalid channels

  It's not clear (to me) how exactly syzbot managed to hit this,
  but it seems conceivable that e.g. regulatory changed and has
  disabled a channel between scanning (channel is checked to be
  usable by cfg80211_get_ies_channel_number) and connecting on
  the channel later.

  With one scenario that isn't covered elsewhere described above,
  the warning isn't good, replace it with a (more informative)
  error message.
