summary: The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress, used by the Newspaper theme, is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘data’ parameter in all versions up to, and including,
  5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can
  successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
