summary: An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by
  sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing
  and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers
  exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still
  parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of
  header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can
  include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode
  than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we
  will process before closing a connection.
