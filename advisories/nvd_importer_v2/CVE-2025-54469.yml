aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables\
  \ CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without\
  \ first sanitising their values.\n\n\nThe entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor\n\
  \ process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks \nwhether the consul\
  \ subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the \nmonitor process uses the popen function\
  \ to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess\
  \ are still active.\n\n\nThe values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT\n\
  \ are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without \nvalidation or sanitization.\
  \  This behavior could allow a malicious user \nto inject malicious commands through these\
  \ variables within the enforcer\n container."
