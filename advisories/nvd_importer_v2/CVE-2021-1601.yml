aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance could allow an unauthenticated,
  adjacent attacker to access sensitive internal services from an external interface. These
  vulnerabilities are due to insufficient restrictions for IPv4 or IPv6 packets that are received
  on the external management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
  specific traffic to this interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to access sensitive internal services and make configuration changes on the affected
  device.
