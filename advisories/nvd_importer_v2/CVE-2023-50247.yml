aliases: []
summary: h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. The QUIC stack
  (quicly), as used by H2O up to commit 43f86e5 (in version 2.3.0-beta and prior), is susceptible
  to a state exhaustion attack. When H2O is serving HTTP/3, a remote attacker can exploit this
  vulnerability to progressively increase the memory retained by the QUIC stack. This can eventually
  cause H2O to abort due to memory exhaustion. The vulnerability has been resolved in commit
  d67e81d03be12a9d53dc8271af6530f40164cd35. HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are not affected by this vulnerability
  as they do not use QUIC. Administrators looking to mitigate this issue without upgrading can
  disable HTTP/3 support.
