summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ring-buffer: Do not warn in ring_buffer_map_get_reader() when reader catches up

  The function ring_buffer_map_get_reader() is a bit more strict than the
  other get reader functions, and except for certain situations the
  rb_get_reader_page() should not return NULL. If it does, it triggers a
  warning.

  This warning was triggering but after looking at why, it was because
  another acceptable situation was happening and it wasn't checked for.

  If the reader catches up to the writer and there's still data to be read
  on the reader page, then the rb_get_reader_page() will return NULL as
  there's no new page to get.

  In this situation, the reader page should not be updated and no warning
  should trigger.
