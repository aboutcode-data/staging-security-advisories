aliases: []
summary: The WC Vendors – WooCommerce Multivendor, WooCommerce Marketplace, Product Vendors
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.6.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the /vendor_dashboard/product/delete/
  endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete vendor products via
  a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
