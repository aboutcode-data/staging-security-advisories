aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the AppDynamics .NET Agent for Windows could allow an attacker to
  leverage an authenticated, local user account to gain SYSTEM privileges. This vulnerability
  is due to the .NET Agent Coordinator Service executing code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker
  with local access to a device that is running the vulnerable agent could create a custom process
  that would be launched with those SYSTEM privileges. A successful exploit could allow the
  attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability
  is fixed in AppDynamics .NET Agent Release 21.7.
