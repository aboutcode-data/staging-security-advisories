aliases: []
summary: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask. In
  affected versions if using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an attacker can share a carefully crafted
  URL with a trusted domain for an application built with Flask-AppBuilder, this URL can redirect
  a user to a malicious site. This is an open redirect vulnerability. To resolve this issue
  upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.2.2 or above. If upgrading is infeasible users may filter HTTP
  traffic containing `?next={next-site}` where the `next-site` domain is different from the
  application you are protecting as a workaround.
