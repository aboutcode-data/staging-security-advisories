aliases: []
summary: The AA Block Country plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions
  up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin trusting user-supplied headers such
  as HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR to determine the client's IP address without proper validation or
  considering if the server is behind a trusted proxy. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to bypass IP-based access restrictions by spoofing their IP address via the X-Forwarded-For
  header.
