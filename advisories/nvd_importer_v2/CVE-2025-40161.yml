  mailbox: zynqmp-ipi: Fix SGI cleanup on unbind

  The driver incorrectly determines SGI vs SPI interrupts by checking IRQ
  number < 16, which fails with dynamic IRQ allocation. During unbind,
  this causes improper SGI cleanup leading to kernel crash.

  Add explicit irq_type field to pdata for reliable identification of SGI
  interrupts (type-2) and only clean up SGI resources when appropriate.
