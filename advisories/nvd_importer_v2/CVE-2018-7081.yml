aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability is present in network-listening components in
  some versions of ArubaOS. An attacker with the ability to transmit specially-crafted IP traffic
  to a mobility controller could exploit this vulnerability and cause a process crash or to
  execute arbitrary code within the underlying operating system with full system privileges.
  Such an attack could lead to complete system compromise. The ability to transmit traffic to
  an IP interface on the mobility controller is required to carry out an attack. The attack
  leverages the PAPI protocol (UDP port 8211). If the mobility controller is only bridging L2
  traffic to an uplink and does not have an IP address that is accessible to the attacker, it
  cannot be attacked.
