aliases: []
summary: 'Incorrect access control in Yubico OTP functionality of the YubiKey hardware tokens
  along with the Yubico OTP validation server. The Yubico OTP supposedly creates hardware bound
  second factor credentials. When a user reprograms the OTP functionality by "writing" it on
  a token using the Yubico Personalization Tool, they can then upload the new configuration
  to Yubicos OTP validation servers. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because there is no way
  for a YubiKey device to prevent a user from deciding that a secret value, which is imported
  into the device, should also be stored elsewhere'
