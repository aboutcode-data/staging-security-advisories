aliases: []
summary: Apache Tapestry up to version 5.8.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service
  (ReDoS) in the way it handles Content Types. Specially crafted Content Types may cause catastrophic
  backtracking, taking exponential time to complete. Specifically, this is about the regular
  expression used on the parameter of the org.apache.tapestry5.http.ContentType class. Apache
  Tapestry 5.8.2 has a fix for this vulnerability. Notice the vulnerability cannot be triggered
  by web requests in Tapestry code alone. It would only happen if there's some non-Tapestry
  codepath passing some outside input to the ContentType class constructor.
