aliases: []
summary: Opera, when configured with the "Determine action by MIME type" option disabled, interprets
  an object as an HTML document even when its MIME Content-Type is text/plain, which could allow
  remote attackers to execute arbitrary script in documents that the user does not expect, possibly
  through web applications that use a text/plain type to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
