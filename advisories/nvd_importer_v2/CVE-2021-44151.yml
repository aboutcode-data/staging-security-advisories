aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. As the session cookies are small, an attacker
  can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the
  Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the
  static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application
  (e.g., /goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker
  can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value
  for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized
  content, when a valid cookie value is hit.
