aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/rockchip: vop2: fail cleanly if missing a primary plane for a video-port

  Each window of a vop2 is usable by a specific set of video ports, so while
  binding the vop2, we look through the list of available windows trying to
  find one designated as primary-plane and usable by that specific port.

  The code later wants to use drm_crtc_init_with_planes with that found
  primary plane, but nothing has checked so far if a primary plane was
  actually found.

  For whatever reason, the rk3576 vp2 does not have a usable primary window
  (if vp0 is also in use) which brought the issue to light and ended in a
  null-pointer dereference further down.

  As we expect a primary-plane to exist for a video-port, add a check at
  the end of the window-iteration and fail probing if none was found.
