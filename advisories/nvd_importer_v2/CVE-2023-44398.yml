aliases: []
summary: Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify
  Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds write was found in Exiv2 version
  v0.28.0. The vulnerable function, `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier
  versions of Exiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds write is triggered when Exiv2 is used
  to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
  to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image
  file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
