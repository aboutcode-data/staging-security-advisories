summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L85-L89)
  computes a divisor quantity by dividing two user controlled values. The user controls the
  values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via the `value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio`
  arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then
  the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside
  of debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger. Later, these computed
  values are used as arguments(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99)
  to `GeneratePoolingSequence`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108).
  There, the first computation is a division in a modulo operation. Since `output_length` can
  be 0, this results in runtime crashing. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
