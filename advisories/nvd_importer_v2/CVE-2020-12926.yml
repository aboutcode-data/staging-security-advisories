aliases: []
summary: The Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) reference software may not properly track the number
  of times a failed shutdown happens. This can leave the TPM in a state where confidential key
  material in the TPM may be able to be compromised. AMD believes that the attack requires physical
  access of the device because the power must be repeatedly turned on and off. This potential
  attack may be used to change confidential information, alter executables signed by key material
  in the TPM, or create a denial of service of the device.
