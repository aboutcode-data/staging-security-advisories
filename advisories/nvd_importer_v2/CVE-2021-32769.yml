aliases: []
summary: Micronaut is a JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building JVM applications.
  A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.5.9. With a basic configuration,
  it is possible to access any file from a filesystem, using "/../../" in the URL. This occurs
  because Micronaut does not restrict file access to configured paths. The vulnerability is
  patched in version 2.5.9. As a workaround, do not use `**` in mapping, use only `*`, which
  exposes only flat structure of a directory not allowing traversal. If using Linux, another
  workaround is to run micronaut in chroot.
