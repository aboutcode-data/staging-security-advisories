summary: The Crafthemes Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads
  due to missing file type validation in the 'process_uploaded_files' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
