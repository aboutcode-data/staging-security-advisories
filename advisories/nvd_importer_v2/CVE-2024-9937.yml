summary: The Woo Manage Fraud Orders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'page' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.7 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
