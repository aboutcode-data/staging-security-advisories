aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Helm through 3.13.3.
  It displays values of secrets when the --dry-run flag is used. This is a security concern
  in some use cases, such as a --dry-run call by a CI/CD tool. NOTE: the vendor''s position
  is that this behavior was introduced intentionally, and cannot be removed without breaking
  backwards compatibility (some users may be relying on these values). Also, it is not the Helm
  Project''s responsibility if a user decides to use --dry-run within a CI/CD environment whose
  output is visible to unauthorized persons.'
