aliases: []
summary: The Admin web application in Kinetica 7.0.9.2.20191118151947 does not properly sanitise
  the input for the function getLogs. This lack of sanitisation could be exploited to allow
  an authenticated attacker to run remote code on the underlying operating system. The logFile
  parameter in the getLogs function was used as a variable in a command to read log files; however,
  due to poor input sanitisation, it was possible to bypass a replacement and break out of the
  command.
