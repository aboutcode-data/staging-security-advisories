summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: adc: rzg2l_adc: Set driver data before enabling runtime PM

  When stress-testing the system by repeatedly unbinding and binding the ADC
  device in a loop, and the ADC is a supplier for another device (e.g., a
  thermal hardware block that reads temperature through the ADC), it may
  happen that the ADC device is runtime-resumed immediately after runtime PM
  is enabled, triggered by its consumer. At this point, since drvdata is not
  yet set and the driver's runtime PM callbacks rely on it, a crash can
  occur. To avoid this, set drvdata just after it was allocated.
