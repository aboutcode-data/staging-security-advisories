aliases: []
summary: The NSS code used for checking PKCS#1 v1.5 was leaking information useful in mounting
  Bleichenbacher-like attacks. Both the overall correctness of the padding as well as the length
  of the encrypted message was leaking through timing side-channel. By sending large number
  of attacker-selected ciphertexts, the attacker would be able to decrypt a previously intercepted
  PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext (for example, to decrypt a TLS session that used RSA key exchange),
  or forge a signature using the victim's key. The issue was fixed by implementing the implicit
  rejection algorithm, in which the NSS returns a deterministic random message in case invalid
  padding is detected, as proposed in the Marvin Attack paper. This vulnerability affects NSS
  < 3.61.
