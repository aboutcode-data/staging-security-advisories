aliases: []
summary: Due to an open redirect vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP, an
  unauthenticated attacker could craft a URL link embedding a malicious script at a location
  not properly sanitized. When a victim clicks on this link, the script executes within the
  victim's browser, redirecting them to a site controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker
  to access and/or modify restricted information related to the web client. While the vulnerability
  poses no impact on data availability, it presents a considerable risk to confidentiality and
  integrity.
