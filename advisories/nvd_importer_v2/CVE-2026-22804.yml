aliases: []
summary: Termix is a web-based server management platform with SSH terminal, tunneling, and
  file editing capabilities. From 1.7.0 to 1.9.0, Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  exists in the Termix File Manager component. The application fails to sanitize SVG file content
  before rendering it. This allows an attacker who has compromised a managed SSH server to plant
  a malicious file, which, when previewed by the Termix user, executes arbitrary JavaScript
  in the context of the application. The vulnerability is located in src/ui/desktop/apps/file-manager/components/FileViewer.tsx.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.0.
