aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Akamai Connect feature of Cisco Wide Area Application Services
  (WAAS) Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service
  (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to certain file-handling inefficiencies
  of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing client systems
  to access a corrupted file that the client systems cannot decompress correctly. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash or hang unexpectedly
  and result in a DoS condition that may require manual intervention to regain normal operating
  conditions. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve82472.'
