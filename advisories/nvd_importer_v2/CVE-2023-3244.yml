summary: 'The Comments Like Dislike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings function called via an AJAX
  action in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
  with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to reset the plugin''s settings. NOTE: After
  attempting to contact the developer with no response, and reporting this to the WordPress
  plugin''s team 30 days ago we are disclosing this issue as it still is not updated.'
