aliases: []
summary: A pickle deserialization vulnerability exists in the Latex English error correction
  plug-in function of binary-husky/gpt_academic versions up to and including 3.83. This vulnerability
  allows attackers to achieve remote command execution by deserializing untrusted data. The
  issue arises from the inclusion of numpy in the deserialization whitelist, which can be exploited
  by constructing a malicious compressed package containing a merge_result.pkl file and a merge_proofread_en.tex
  file. The vulnerability is fixed in commit 91f5e6b.
