summary: The WP JobHunt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 7.1. This is due to wp_ajax_google_api_login_callback function not properly
  verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to access arbitrary candidate accounts.
