summary: |
  Recent x86 CPUs offer functionality named Control-flow Enforcement
  Technology (CET).  A sub-feature of this are Shadow Stacks (CET-SS).
  CET-SS is a hardware feature designed to protect against Return Oriented
  Programming attacks. When enabled, traditional stacks holding both data
  and return addresses are accompanied by so called "shadow stacks",
  holding little more than return addresses.  Shadow stacks aren't
  writable by normal instructions, and upon function returns their
  contents are used to check for possible manipulation of a return address
  coming from the traditional stack.

  In particular certain memory accesses need intercepting by Xen.  In
  various cases the necessary emulation involves kind of replaying of
  the instruction.  Such replaying typically involves filling and then
  invoking of a stub.  Such a replayed instruction may raise an
  exceptions, which is expected and dealt with accordingly.

  Unfortunately the interaction of both of the above wasn't right:
  Recovery involves removal of a call frame from the (traditional) stack.
  The counterpart of this operation for the shadow stack was missing.
