summary: Rasa Pro is a framework for building scalable, dynamic conversational AI assistants
  that integrate large language models (LLMs). A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa Pro
  where voice connectors in Rasa Pro do not properly implement authentication even when a token
  is configured in the credentials.yml file. This could allow an attacker to submit voice data
  to the Rasa Pro assistant from an unauthenticated source. This issue has been patched for
  audiocodes, audiocodes_stream, and genesys connectors in versions 3.9.20, 3.10.19, 3.11.7
  and 3.12.6.
