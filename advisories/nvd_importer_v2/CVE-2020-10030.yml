summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0. It allows
  an attacker (with enough privileges to change the system's hostname) to cause disclosure of
  uninitialized memory content via a stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems
  where gethostname() does not have '\0' termination of the returned string if the hostname
  is larger than the supplied buffer. (Linux systems are not affected because the buffer is
  always large enough. OpenBSD systems are not affected because the returned hostname always
  has '\0' termination.) Under some conditions, this issue can lead to the writing of one '\0'
  byte out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.
