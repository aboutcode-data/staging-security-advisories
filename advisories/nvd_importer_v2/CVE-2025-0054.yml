summary: SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java does not sufficiently handle user input, resulting
  in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. The application allows attackers with basic
  user privileges to store a Javascript payload on the server, which could be later executed
  in the victim's web browser. With this the attacker might be able to read or modify information
  associated with the vulnerable web page.
