summary: 'fast-redact is a package that provides do very fast object redaction. A Prototype
  Pollution vulnerability in the nestedRestore function of fast-redact version 3.5.0 and before
  allows attackers to inject properties on Object.prototype via supplying a crafted payload,
  causing denial of service (DoS) as the minimum consequence. NOTE: the Supplier disputes this
  because the reporter only demonstrated access to properties by an internal utility function,
  and there is no means for achieving prototype pollution via the public API.'
