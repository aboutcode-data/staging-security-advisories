aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the Cloud Foundry component Cloud
  Controller that affects cf-release versions prior to v208 and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic
  Runtime versions prior to 1.4.2. Path traversal is the 'outbreak' of a given directory structure
  through relative file paths in the user input. It aims at accessing files and directories
  that are stored outside the web root folder, for disallowed reading or even executing arbitrary
  system commands. An attacker could use a certain parameter of the file path for instance to
  inject '../' sequences in order to navigate through the file system. In this particular case
  a remote authenticated attacker can exploit the identified vulnerability in order to upload
  arbitrary files to the server running a Cloud Controller instance - outside the isolated application
  container.
