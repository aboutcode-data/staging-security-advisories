aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Progress DataDirect Connect for ODBC before 08.02.2770 for
  Oracle. When using Oracle Advanced Security (OAS) encryption, if an error is encountered initializing
  the encryption object used to encrypt data, the code falls back to a different encryption
  mechanism that uses an insecure random number generator to generate the private key. It is
  possible for a well-placed attacker to predict the output of this random number generator,
  which could lead to an attacker decrypting traffic between the driver and the database server.
  The vulnerability does not exist if SSL / TLS encryption is used.
