aliases: []
summary: 'Lorensbergs Connect2 3.13.7647.20190 is affected by an XSS vulnerability. Exploitation
  requires administrator privileges and is performed through the Wizard editor of the application.
  The attack requires an administrator to go into the Wizard editor and enter an XSS payload
  within the Page title, Page Instructions, Text before, Text after, or Text on side box. Once
  this has been done, the administrator must click save and finally wait until any user of the
  application performs a booking for rental items in the booking area of the application, where
  the XSS triggers. NOTE: another perspective is that the administrator may require JavaScript
  to customize any aspect of the page rendering. There is no effective way for the product to
  defend users in the face of a malicious administrator'
