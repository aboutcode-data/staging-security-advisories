summary: Stellar-core is a reference implementation for the peer-to-peer agent that manages
  the Stellar network. Prior to 20.4.0, core nodes could be randomly crashed due to a race condition
  with a 3rd party library. The likelihood of affecting the network is low since crashed nodes
  come back up online right away. Code fix mitigation is part of Stellar-core v20.4.0 release
