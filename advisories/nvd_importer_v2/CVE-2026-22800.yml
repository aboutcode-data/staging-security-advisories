aliases: []
summary: PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton.
  Prior to 4.10.0, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in an administrative
  API endpoint responsible for terminating all active video conferences on a single server.
  The affected endpoint performs a destructive action but is exposed via an HTTP GET request.
  Although proper authorization checks are enforced and the endpoint cannot be triggered cross-site,
  the use of GET allows the action to be implicitly invoked through same-site content (e.g.
  embedded resources rendered within the application). As a result, an authenticated administrator
  who views crafted content within the application may unknowingly trigger the endpoint, causing
  all active video conferences on the server to be terminated without explicit intent or confirmation.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.0.
