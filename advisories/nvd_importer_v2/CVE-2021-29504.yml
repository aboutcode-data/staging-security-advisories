aliases: []
summary: WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. An improper error handling in HTTPS
  requests management in WP-CLI version 0.12.0 and later allows remote attackers able to intercept
  the communication to remotely disable the certificate verification on WP-CLI side, gaining
  full control over the communication content, including the ability to impersonate update servers
  and push malicious updates towards WordPress instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI
  agent, or push malicious updates toward WP-CLI itself. The vulnerability stems from the fact
  that the default behavior of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` when encountering a TLS handshake
  error is to disable certificate validation and retry the same request. The default behavior
  has been changed with version 2.5.0 of WP-CLI and the `wp-cli/wp-cli` framework (via https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523)
  so that the `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` method accepts an `$insecure` option that is `false`
  by default and consequently that a TLS handshake failure is a hard error by default. This
  new default is a breaking change and ripples through to all consumers of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()`,
  including those in separate WP-CLI bundled or third-party packages. https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523
  has also added an `--insecure` flag to the `cli update` command to counter this breaking change.
  There is no direct workaround for the default insecure behavior of `wp-cli/wp-cli` versions
  before 2.5.0. The workaround for dealing with the breaking change in the commands directly
  affected by the new secure default behavior is to add the `--insecure` flag to manually opt-in
  to the previous insecure behavior.
