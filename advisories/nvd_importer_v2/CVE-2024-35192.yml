aliases: []
summary: Trivy is a security scanner. Prior to 0.51.2, if a malicious actor is able to trigger
  Trivy to scan container images from a crafted malicious registry, it could result in the leakage
  of credentials for legitimate registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google
  Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR). These tokens can then
  be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy
  has access. Systems are not affected if the default credential provider chain is unable to
  obtain valid credentials. This vulnerability only applies when scanning container images directly
  from a registry. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.2.
