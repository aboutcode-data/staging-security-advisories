aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in FFmpeg’s TensorFlow backend within the libavfilter/dnn_backend_tf.c
  source file. The issue occurs in the dnn_execute_model_tf() function, where a task object
  is freed multiple times in certain error-handling paths. This redundant memory deallocation
  can lead to a double-free condition, potentially causing FFmpeg or any application using it
  to crash when processing TensorFlow-based DNN models. This results in a denial-of-service
  scenario but does not allow arbitrary code execution under normal conditions.
