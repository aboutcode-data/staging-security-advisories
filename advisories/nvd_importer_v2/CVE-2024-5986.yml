aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1 allows remote attackers to write arbitrary
  data to any file on the server. This is achieved by exploiting the `/3/Parse` endpoint to
  inject attacker-controlled data as the header of an empty file, which is then exported using
  the `/3/Frames/framename/export` endpoint. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential
  for remote code execution and complete access to the system running h2o-3, as attackers can
  overwrite critical files such as private SSH keys or script files.
