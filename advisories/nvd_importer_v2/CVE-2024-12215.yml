summary: In kedro-org/kedro version 0.19.8, the `pull_package()` API function allows users to
  download and extract micro packages from the Internet. However, the function `project_wheel_metadata()`
  within the code path can execute the `setup.py` file inside the tar file, leading to remote
  code execution (RCE) by running arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.
