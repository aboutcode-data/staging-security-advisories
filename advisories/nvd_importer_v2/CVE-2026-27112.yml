aliases: []
summary: Kargo manages and automates the promotion of software artifacts. From 1.7.0 to before
  v1.7.8, v1.8.11, and v1.9.3, the batch resource creation endpoints of both Kargo's legacy
  gRPC API and newer REST API accept multi-document YAML payloads. Specially crafted payloads
  can manifest a bug present in the logic of both endpoints to inject arbitrary resources (of
  specific types only) into the underlying namespace of an existing Project using the API server's
  own permissions when that behavior was not intended. Critically, an attacker may exploit this
  as a vector for elevating their own permissions, which can then be leveraged to achieve remote
  code execution or secret exfiltration. Exfiltrated artifact repository credentials can be
  leveraged, in turn, to execute further attacks. In some configurations of the Kargo control
  plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster, elevated permissions may additionally be leveraged
  to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration using kubectl. This can reduce the
  complexity of the attack, however, worst case scenarios remain entirely achievable even without
  this. This vulnerability is fixed in v1.7.8, v1.8.11, and v1.9.3.
