aliases: []
summary: Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, that is
  fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. Prior to version 6.1.12, the USB DFU UPLOAD functionality
  may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents.
  In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary
  code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function prevents buffer
  overflow during handling of DFU UPLOAD command when current state is `UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE`.
  This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 6.1.12. As a workaround, add the `UPLOAD_LENGTH`
  check in all possible states.
