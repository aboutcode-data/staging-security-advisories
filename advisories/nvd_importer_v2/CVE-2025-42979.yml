aliases: []
summary: The GuiXT application, which is integrated with SAP GUI for Windows, uses obfuscation
  algorithms instead of secure symmetric ciphers for storing the credentials of an RFC user
  on the client PC. This leads to a high impact on confidentiality because any attacker who
  gains access to the user hive of this user�s windows registry could recreate the original
  password. There is no impact on integrity or availability of the application
