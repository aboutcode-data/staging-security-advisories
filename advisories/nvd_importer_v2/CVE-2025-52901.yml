aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.9, access
  tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier
  will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an
  attacker full access to a user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user
  has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.
