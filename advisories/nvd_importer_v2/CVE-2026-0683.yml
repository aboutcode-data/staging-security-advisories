aliases: []
summary: The SupportCandy – Helpdesk & Customer Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to SQL Injection via the Number-type custom field filter in all versions up to,
  and including, 3.4.4. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied operand value
  when using the equals operator and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above
  (customers), to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
  to extract sensitive information from the database.
