aliases: []
summary: The Elements Plus! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's Image Comparison, HotSpot Plus, and Google Maps widgets in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.16.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
  supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
