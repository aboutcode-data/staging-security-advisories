aliases: []
summary: The Simple User Meta Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the user meta value field in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations
  and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
