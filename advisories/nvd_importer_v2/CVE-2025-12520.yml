aliases: []
summary: The WP Airbnb Review Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 4.2 due to insufficient
  URL validation that allows users to pull in a malicious HTML file. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
  affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
