summary: OpenSearch Anomaly Detection identifies atypical data and receives automatic notifications.
  There is an issue with the application of document and field level restrictions in the Anomaly
  Detection plugin, where users with the Anomaly Detector role can read aggregated numerical
  data (e.g. averages, sums) of fields that are otherwise restricted to them. This issue only
  affects authenticated users who were previously granted read access to the indexes containing
  the restricted fields. This issue has been patched in versions 1.3.8 and 2.6.0. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
