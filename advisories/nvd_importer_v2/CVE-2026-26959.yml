aliases: []
summary: ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. Versions 0.9.26020 and below fail to
  validate the integrity or authenticity of the ADB binary path specified in the ManualAdbPath
  setting before executing it, allowing arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the
  current user. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious App.txt settings file that
  points ManualAdbPath to an arbitrary executable, then convincing a victim to launch the application
  with a command-line argument directing it to the malicious configuration directory. This vulnerability
  could be leveraged through social engineering tactics, such as distributing a shortcut bundled
  with a crafted settings file in an archive, resulting in RCE upon application startup. Thus
  issue has been fixed in version 0.9.26021.
