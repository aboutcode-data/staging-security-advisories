summary: The Takeads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.0.13. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user
  is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  subscriber-level access and above, to delete the plugin's configuration options.
