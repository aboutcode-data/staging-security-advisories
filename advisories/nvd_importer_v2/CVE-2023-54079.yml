  power: supply: bq27xxx: Fix poll_interval handling and races on remove

  Before this patch bq27xxx_battery_teardown() was setting poll_interval = 0
  to avoid bq27xxx_battery_update() requeuing the delayed_work item.

  There are 2 problems with this:

  1. If the driver is unbound through sysfs, rather then the module being
     rmmod-ed, this changes poll_interval unexpectedly

  2. This is racy, after it being set poll_interval could be changed
     before bq27xxx_battery_update() checks it through
     /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval

  Fix this by added a removed attribute to struct bq27xxx_device_info and
  using that instead of setting poll_interval to 0.

  There also is another poll_interval related race on remove(), writing
  /sys/module/bq27xxx_battery/parameters/poll_interval will requeue
  the delayed_work item for all devices on the bq27xxx_battery_devices
  list and the device being removed was only removed from that list
  after cancelling the delayed_work item.

  Fix this by moving the removal from the bq27xxx_battery_devices list
  to before cancelling the delayed_work item.
