summary: Tendenci is an open source content management system built for non-profits, associations
  and cause-based sites. Versions 15.3.11 and below include a critical deserialization vulnerability
  in the Helpdesk module (which is not enabled by default). This vulnerability allows Remote
  Code Execution (RCE) by an authenticated user with staff security level due to using Python's
  pickle module in helpdesk /reports/. The original CVE-2020-14942 was incompletely patched.
  While ticket_list() was fixed to use safe JSON deserialization, the run_report() function
  still uses unsafe pickle.loads(). The impact is limited to the permissions of the user running
  the application, typically www-data, which generally lacks write (except for upload directories)
  and execute permissions. This issue has been fixed in version 15.3.12.
