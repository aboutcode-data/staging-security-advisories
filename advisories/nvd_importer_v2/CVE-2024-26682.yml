  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mac80211: improve CSA/ECSA connection refusal

  As mentioned in the previous commit, we pretty quickly found
  that some APs have ECSA elements stuck in their probe response,
  so using that to not attempt to connect while CSA is happening
  we never connect to such an AP.

  Improve this situation by checking more carefully and ignoring
  the ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA element
  being stuck in the probe response.

  Additionally, allow connecting to an AP that's switching to a
  channel it's already using, unless it's using quiet mode. In
  this case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it's
  actually switching channels, it's better not to try to connect
  in the middle of that.
