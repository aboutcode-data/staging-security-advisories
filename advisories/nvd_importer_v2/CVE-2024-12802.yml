aliases: []
summary: SSL-VPN MFA Bypass in SonicWALL SSL-VPN can arise in specific cases due to the separate
  handling of UPN (User Principal Name) and SAM (Security Account Manager) account names when
  integrated with Microsoft Active Directory, allowing MFA to be configured independently for
  each login method and potentially enabling attackers to bypass MFA by exploiting the alternative
  account name.
