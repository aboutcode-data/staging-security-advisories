summary: Server-Side Access Control Bypass vulnerability in WombatDialer before 25.02 could
  allow unauthorized users to potentially call certain services without the necessary access
  level. This issue is limited to services used by the client (not the general-use JSON services)
  and requires reverse engineering of the proprietary serialization protocol, making it difficult
  to exploit.
