aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Quay. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks force a user to
  perform unwanted actions in an application. During the pentest, it was detected that the config-editor
  page is vulnerable to CSRF. The config-editor page is used to configure the Quay instance.
  By coercing the victim’s browser into sending an attacker-controlled request from another
  domain, it is possible to reconfigure the Quay instance (including adding users with admin
  privileges).
