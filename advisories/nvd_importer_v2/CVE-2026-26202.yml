aliases: []
summary: Penpot is an open-source design tool for design and code collaboration. Prior to version
  2.13.2, an authenticated user can read arbitrary files from the server by supplying a local
  file path (e.g. `/etc/passwd`) as a font data chunk in the `create-font-variant` RPC endpoint,
  resulting in the file contents being stored and retrievable as a "font" asset. This is an
  arbitrary file read vulnerability. Any authenticated user with team edit permissions can read
  arbitrary files accessible to the Penpot backend process on the host filesystem. This can
  lead to exposure of sensitive system files, application secrets, database credentials, and
  private keys, potentially enabling further compromise of the server. In containerized deployments,
  the blast radius may be limited to the container filesystem, but environment variables, mounted
  secrets, and application configuration are still at risk. Version 2.13.2 contains a patch
  for the issue.
