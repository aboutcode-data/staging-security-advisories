aliases: []
summary: Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a
  large number of notes organised into notebooks. Joplin's HTML sanitizer allows the `name`
  attribute to be specified. If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property
  (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element. This vulnerability's only
  known impact is denial of service. The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and re-opened
  with a different note. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 and all users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
