aliases: []
summary: BuddyBoss Platform through 1.8.0 allows remote attackers to obtain the email address
  of each user. When creating a new user, it generates a Unique ID for their profile. This UID
  is their private email address with symbols removed and periods replaced with hyphens. For
  example. JohnDoe@example.com would become /members/johndoeexample-com and Jo.test@example.com
  would become /members/jo-testexample-com. The members list is available to everyone and (in
  a default configuration) often without authentication. It is therefore trivial to collect
  a list of email addresses.
