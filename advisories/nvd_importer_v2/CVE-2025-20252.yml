aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco Secure\
  \ Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD)\
  \ Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a memory leak, resulting\
  \ in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper parsing\
  \ of IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous stream\
  \ of crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to partially exhaust system memory, causing system instability like being unable to establish\
  \ new IKEv2 VPN sessions. A manual reboot of the device is required to recover from this condition."
