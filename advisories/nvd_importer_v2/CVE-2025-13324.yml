aliases: []
summary: Mattermost versions 10.11.x <= 10.11.5, 11.0.x <= 11.0.4, 10.12.x <= 10.12.2 fail to
  invalidate remote cluster invite tokens when using the legacy (version 1) protocol or when
  the confirming party does not provide a refreshed token, which allows an attacker who has
  obtained an invite token to authenticate as the remote cluster and perform limited actions
  on shared channels even after the invitation has been legitimately confirmed.
