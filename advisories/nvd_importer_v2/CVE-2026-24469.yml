aliases: []
summary: C++ HTTP Server is an HTTP/1.1 server built to handle client connections and serve
  HTTP requests. Versions 1.0 and below are vulnerable to Path Traversal via the RequestHandler::handleRequest
  method. This flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files from
  the server's filesystem by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request containing ../ sequences.
  The application fails to sanitize the filename variable derived from the user-controlled URL
  path, directly concatenating it to the files_directory base path and enabling traversal outside
  the intended root. No patch was available at the time of publication.
