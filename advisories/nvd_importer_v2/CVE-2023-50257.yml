aliases: []
summary: eProsima Fast DDS (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution
  Service standard of the Object Management Group. Even with the application of SROS2, due to
  the issue where the data (`p[UD]`) and `guid` values used to disconnect between nodes are
  not encrypted, a vulnerability has been discovered where a malicious attacker can forcibly
  disconnect a Subscriber and can deny a Subscriber attempting to connect. Afterwards, if the
  attacker sends the packet for disconnecting, which is data (`p[UD]`), to the Global Data Space
  (`239.255.0.1:7400`) using the said Publisher ID, all the Subscribers (Listeners) connected
  to the Publisher (Talker) will not receive any data and their connection will be disconnected.
  Moreover, if this disconnection packet is sent continuously, the Subscribers (Listeners) trying
  to connect will not be able to do so. Since the initial commit of the `SecurityManager.cpp`
  code (`init`, `on_process_handshake`) on Nov 8, 2016, the Disconnect Vulnerability in RTPS
  Packets Used by SROS2 has been present prior to versions 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and
  2.6.7.
