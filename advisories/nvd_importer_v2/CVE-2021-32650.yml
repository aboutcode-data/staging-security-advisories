aliases: []
summary: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the
  Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with access to the
  backend is able to execute PHP code by using the theme import feature. This will bypass the
  safe mode feature that prevents PHP execution in the CMS templates.The issue has been patched
  in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation
  manually as a workaround.
