summary: MailEnable Enterprise Premium 10.23 was vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection
  (XXE) attacks that could be exploited by an unauthenticated user. It was possible for an attacker
  to use a vulnerability in the configuration of the XML processor to read any file on the host
  system. Because all credentials were stored in a cleartext file, it was possible to steal
  all users' credentials (including the highest privileged users).
