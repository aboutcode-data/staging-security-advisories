aliases: []
summary: The GSheetConnector For Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
  bypass in versions less than, or equal to, 1.3.27. This is due to a missing capability check
  on the 'install_plugin' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  subscriber-level access and above to install plugins on the target site and potentially achieve
  arbitrary code execution on the server under certain conditions.
