summary: The The Back In Stock Notifier for WooCommerce | WooCommerce Waitlist Pro plugin for
  WordPress for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up
  to, and including, 5.3.1. This is due to the plugin for WordPress allowing users to execute
  an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
