aliases: []
summary: The Ebook Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions
  up to, and including, 5.8001. This is due to the plugin utilizing fpdi-protection and not
  preventing direct access to test files that have display_errors set to true. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which
  can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and
  requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
