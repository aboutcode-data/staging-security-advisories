summary: Oqtane Framework 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. By manipulating the
  entityid parameter, attackers can bypass passcode validation and successfully log into the
  application or access restricted data without proper authorization. The lack of server-side
  validation exacerbates the issue, as the application relies on client-side information for
  authentication.
