summary: Langfuse is an open source large language model engineering platform. Starting in version
  2.70.0 and prior to versions 2.95.11 and 3.124.1, in certain project membership APIs, the
  server trusted a user‑controlled orgId and used it in authorization checks. As a result, any
  authenticated user on the same Langfuse instance could enumerate names and email addresses
  of users in another organization if they knew the target organization’s ID. Disclosure is
  limited to names and email addresses of members/invitees. No customer data such as traces,
  prompts, or evaluations is exposed or accessible. For Langfuse Cloud, the maintainers ran
  a thorough investigation of access logs of the last 30 days and could not find any evidence
  that this vulnerability was exploited. For most self-hosting deployments, the attack surface
  is significantly reduced given an SSO provider is configured and email/password sign-up is
  disabled. In these cases, only users who authenticate via the Enterprise SSO IdP (e.g. Okta)
  would be able to exploit this vulnerability to access the member list, i.e. internal users
  getting access to a list of other internal users. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the
  actor must have a valid Langfuse user account within the same instance, know the target orgId,
  and use the request made to the API that powers the frontend membership tables, including
  their project/user authentication token, while changing the orgId to the target organization.
  Langfuse Cloud (EU, US, HIPAA) were affected until fix deployment on November 1, 2025. The
  maintainers reviewed the Langfuse Cloud access logs from the past 30 days and found no evidence
  that this vulnerability was exploited. Self-Hosted versions which contain patches include
  v2.95.11 for major version 2 and v3.124.1 for major version 3. There are no known workarounds.
  Upgrading is required to fully mitigate this issue.
