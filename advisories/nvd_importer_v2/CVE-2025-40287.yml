  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  exfat: fix improper check of dentry.stream.valid_size

  We found an infinite loop bug in the exFAT file system that can lead to a
  Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. When a dentry in an exFAT filesystem is
  malformed, the following system calls — SYS_openat, SYS_ftruncate, and
  SYS_pwrite64 — can cause the kernel to hang.

  Root cause analysis shows that the size validation code in exfat_find()
  does not check whether dentry.stream.valid_size is negative. As a result,
  the system calls mentioned above can succeed and eventually trigger the DoS
  issue.

  This patch adds a check for negative dentry.stream.valid_size to prevent
  this vulnerability.
