aliases: []
summary: qdrant/qdrant version 1.9.0-dev is vulnerable to arbitrary file read and write during
  the snapshot recovery process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating snapshot
  files to include symlinks, leading to arbitrary file read by adding a symlink that points
  to a desired file on the filesystem and arbitrary file write by including a symlink and a
  payload file in the snapshot's directory structure. This vulnerability allows for the reading
  and writing of arbitrary files on the server, which could potentially lead to a full takeover
  of the system. The issue is fixed in version v1.9.0.
