aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  um: work around sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode

  sched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in
  time-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to
  be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with
  time-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on
  the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).

  Work around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a
  sched_yield syscall.
