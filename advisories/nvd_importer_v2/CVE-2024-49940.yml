  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  l2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflow

  When a session is created, it sets a backpointer to its tunnel. When
  the session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel
  refcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel is
  set in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented
  by l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where
  session->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't been
  bumped.

  Moving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but
  l2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses
  session->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap. Add an encap arg to
  l2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session->tunnel.

  If l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for
  l2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a
  session which doesn't yet have session->tunnel set. Add a check for
  this case.
