summary: isolated-vm is a library for nodejs which gives you access to v8's Isolate interface.
  Versions of isolated-vm before v4.0.0 have API pitfalls which may make it easy for implementers
  to expose supposed secure isolates to the permissions of the main nodejs isolate. Reference
  objects allow access to the underlying reference's full prototype chain. In an environment
  where the implementer has exposed a Reference instance to an attacker they would be able to
  use it to acquire a Reference to the nodejs context's Function object. Similar application-specific
  attacks could be possible by modifying the local prototype of other API objects. Access to
  NativeModule objects could allow an attacker to load and run native code from anywhere on
  the filesystem. If combined with, for example, a file upload API this would allow for arbitrary
  code execution. This is addressed in v4.0.0 through a series of related changes.
