aliases: []
summary: The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the
  cookie in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.21 due to insufficient escaping on the user
  supplied value and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database.
