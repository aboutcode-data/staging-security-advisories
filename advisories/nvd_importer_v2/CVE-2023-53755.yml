summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback

  Resolves a panic that can occur on AMD systems, typically during host
  shutdown, after the PTDMA driver had been exercised. The issue was
  the pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will
  be at least one descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function
  is called. However, it is possible that both the Submitted and Issued
  queues could be empty, which could result in pt_cmd_callback() being
  mistakenly called with a NULL pointer.
