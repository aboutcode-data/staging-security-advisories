summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)\
  \ could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition\
  \ on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain TLS\
  \ connections that are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by establishing a large number of concurrent TLS connections to an affected device. A successful\
  \ exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to drop new TLS email messages that\
  \ come from the associated email servers. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not cause\
  \ the affected device to unexpectedly reload. The device will recover autonomously within\
  \ a few hours of when the attack is halted or mitigated."
