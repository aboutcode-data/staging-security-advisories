aliases: []
summary: The PnPSCADA system, a product of SDG Technologies CC, is afflicted by a critical unauthenticated
  error-based PostgreSQL Injection vulnerability. Present within the hitlogcsv.jsp endpoint,
  this security flaw permits unauthenticated attackers to engage with the underlying database
  seamlessly and passively. Consequently, malicious actors could gain access to vital information,
  such as Industrial Control System (ICS) and OT data, alongside other sensitive records like
  SMS and SMS Logs. The unauthorized database access exposes compromised systems to potential
  manipulation or breach of essential infrastructure data, highlighting the severity of this
  vulnerability.
