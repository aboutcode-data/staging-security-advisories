  accel/qaic: Fix bootlog initialization ordering

  As soon as we queue MHI buffers to receive the bootlog from the device,
  we could be receiving data. Therefore all the resources needed to
  process that data need to be setup prior to queuing the buffers.

  We currently initialize some of the resources after queuing the buffers
  which creates a race between the probe() and any data that comes back
  from the device. If the uninitialized resources are accessed, we could
  see page faults.

  Fix the init ordering to close the race.
