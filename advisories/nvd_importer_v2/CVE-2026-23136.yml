  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  libceph: reset sparse-read state in osd_fault()

  When a fault occurs, the connection is abandoned, reestablished, and any
  pending operations are retried. The OSD client tracks the progress of a
  sparse-read reply using a separate state machine, largely independent of
  the messenger's state.

  If a connection is lost mid-payload or the sparse-read state machine
  returns an error, the sparse-read state is not reset. The OSD client
  will then interpret the beginning of a new reply as the continuation of
  the old one. If this makes the sparse-read machinery enter a failure
  state, it may never recover, producing loops like:

    libceph:  [0] got 0 extents
    libceph: data len 142248331 != extent len 0
    libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read
    libceph: data len 142248331 != extent len 0
    libceph: osd0 (1)...:6801 socket error on read

  Therefore, reset the sparse-read state in osd_fault(), ensuring retries
  start from a clean state.
