aliases: []
summary: "In Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) versions below below 4.13.3, 4.15.3, or 4.17.1,\
  \ a malicious actor can inject American National Standards Institute (ANSI) escape codes into\
  \ Splunk ITSI log files that, when a vulnerable terminal application reads them, can run malicious\
  \ code in the vulnerable application. This attack requires a user to use a terminal application\
  \ that translates ANSI escape codes to read the malicious log file locally in the vulnerable\
  \ terminal. The vulnerability also requires additional user interaction to succeed. \n\nThe\
  \ vulnerability does not directly affect Splunk ITSI. The indirect impact on Splunk ITSI can\
  \ vary significantly depending on the permissions in the vulnerable terminal application,\
  \ as well as where and how the user reads the malicious log file. For example, users can copy\
  \ the malicious file from Splunk ITSI and read it on their local machine."
