  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-dai: Ensure DAI widget is valid during params

  Each cpu DAI should associate with a widget. However, the topology might
  not create the right number of DAI widgets for aggregated amps. And it
  will cause NULL pointer deference.
  Check that the DAI widget associated with the CPU DAI is valid to prevent
  NULL pointer deference due to missing DAI widgets in topologies with
  aggregated amps.
