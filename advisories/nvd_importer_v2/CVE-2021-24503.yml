aliases: []
summary: The Popular Brand Icons – Simple Icons WordPress plugin before 2.7.8 does not sanitise
  or validate some of its shortcode parameters, such as "color", "size" or "class", allowing
  users with a role as low as Contributor to set Cross-Site payload in them. A post made by
  a contributor would still have to be approved by an admin to have the XSS triggered in the
  frontend, however, higher privilege users, such as editor could exploit this without the need
  of approval, and even when the blog disallows the unfiltered_html capability.
