aliases: []
summary: symfony/http-foundation is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which defines an
  object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. The `Request` class, does not parse URI
  with special characters the same way browsers do. As a result, an attacker can trick a validator
  relying on the `Request` class to redirect users to another domain. The `Request::create`
  methods now assert the URI does not contain invalid characters as defined by https://url.spec.whatwg.org/.
  This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7. Users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
