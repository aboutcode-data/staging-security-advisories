aliases: []
summary: 'October CMS through 1.0.428 does not prevent use of .htaccess in themes, which allows
  remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code by downloading a theme ZIP archive
  from /backend/cms/themes, and then uploading and importing a modified archive with two new
  files: a .php file and a .htaccess file. NOTE: the vendor says "I don''t think [an attacker
  able to login to the system under an account that has access to manage/upload themes] is a
  threat model that we need to be considering.'
