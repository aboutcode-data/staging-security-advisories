aliases: []
summary: teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality to protect
  against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable to bypassing
  common web attack rules when a specific HTML entities payload is used. This vulnerability
  allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise
  the security of the web application. The vulnerability exists due to teler-waf failure to
  properly sanitize and filter HTML entities in user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal
  sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the
  victim's browser and perform malicious actions. This issue has been fixed in version 0.1.1.
