aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in certain IPv4 fragment-processing functions of Cisco Remote PHY Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impact traffic passing through a device,
  potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the affected
  software not validating and calculating certain numerical values in IPv4 packets that are
  sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed
  IPv4 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disrupt
  the flow of certain IPv4 traffic passing through an affected device, which could result in
  a DoS condition.
