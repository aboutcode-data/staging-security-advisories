aliases: []
summary: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that
  can run Node.js. In versions prior to 4.10.16, or from 5.0.0 to 5.2.6, validation of the authentication
  adapter app ID for _Facebook_ and _Spotify_ may be circumvented. Configurations which allow
  users to authenticate using the Parse Server authentication adapter where `appIds` is set
  as a string instead of an array of strings authenticate requests from an app with a different
  app ID than the one specified in the `appIds` configuration. For this vulnerability to be
  exploited, an attacker needs to be assigned an app ID by the authentication provider which
  is a sub-set of the server-side configured app ID. This issue is patched in versions 4.10.16
  and 5.2.7. There are no known workarounds.
