aliases: []
summary: 'Turnkey Web Tools SunShop Shopping Cart allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
  information via a phpinfo action to (1) index.php, (2) admin/index.php, and (3) admin/adminindex.php,
  which executes the PHP phpinfo function.  NOTE: The vendor has disputed this issue, saying
  that "Having this in the code makes it easier for us to troubleshoot when issues arise on
  individual carts. For someone to have a script to do this type of search would require that
  they know where your shop is actually located. I dont think it really can be construde [sic]
  as a security issue.'
