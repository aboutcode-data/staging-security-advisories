aliases: []
summary: In Bludit v1.5.2 and v2.0.1, an XSS vulnerability is located in the new page, new category,
  and edit post function body message context. Remote attackers are able to bypass the basic
  editor validation to trigger cross site scripting. The XSS is persistent and the request method
  to inject via editor is GET. To save the editor context, the followup POST method request
  must be processed to perform the attack via the application side. The basic validation of
  the editor does not allow injecting script codes and blocks the context. Attackers can inject
  the code by using an editor tag that is not recognized by the basic validation. Thus allows
  a restricted user account to inject malicious script code to perform a persistent attack against
  higher privilege web-application user accounts.
