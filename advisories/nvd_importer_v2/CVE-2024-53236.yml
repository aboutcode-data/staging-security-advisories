summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  xsk: Free skb when TX metadata options are invalid

  When a new skb is allocated for transmitting an xsk descriptor, i.e., for
  every non-multibuf descriptor or the first frag of a multibuf descriptor,
  but the descriptor is later found to have invalid options set for the TX
  metadata, the new skb is never freed. This can leak skbs until the send
  buffer is full which makes sending more packets impossible.

  Fix this by freeing the skb in the error path if we are currently dealing
  with the first frag, i.e., an skb allocated in this iteration of
  xsk_build_skb.
