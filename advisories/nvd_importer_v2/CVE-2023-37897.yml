summary: 'Grav is a file-based Web-platform built in PHP. Grav is subject to a server side template
  injection (SSTI) vulnerability. The fix for another SSTI vulnerability using `|map`, `|filter`
  and `|reduce` twigs implemented in the commit `71bbed1` introduces bypass of the denylist
  due to incorrect return value from `isDangerousFunction()`, which allows to execute the payload
  prepending double backslash (`\\`). The `isDangerousFunction()` check in version 1.7.42 and
  onwards retuns `false` value instead of `true` when the `\` symbol is found in the `$name`.
  This vulnerability can be exploited if the attacker has access to: 1. an Administrator account,
  or 2. a non-administrator, user account that has Admin panel access and Create/Update page
  permissions. A fix for this vulnerability has been introduced in commit `b4c6210` and is included
  in release version `1.7.42.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.'
