summary: The WP Shortcodes Plugin — Shortcodes Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.4.5 via the su_shortcode_csv_table
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access
  and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application
  and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. If the 'Unsafe features'
  option is explicitly enabled by an administrator, this issue becomes exploitable by Contributor+
  attackers
