aliases: []
summary: Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, a malicious
  attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a maliciously crafted Java deserialization
  gadget chain leveraged against the Ratpack session store. If one's application does not use
  Ratpack's session mechanism, it is not vulnerable. Ratpack 1.9.0 introduces a strict allow-list
  mechanism that mitigates this vulnerability when used. Two possible workarounds exist. The
  simplest mitigation for users of earlier versions is to reduce the likelihood of attackers
  being able to write to the session data store. Alternatively or additionally, the allow-list
  mechanism could be manually back ported by providing an alternative implementation of `SessionSerializer`
  that uses an allow-list.
