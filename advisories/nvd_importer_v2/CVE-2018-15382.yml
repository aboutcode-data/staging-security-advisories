summary: A vulnerability in Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
  attacker to generate valid, signed session tokens. The vulnerability is due to a static signing
  key that is present in all Cisco HyperFlex systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability

  signed session tokens for another HyperFlex system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to access the HyperFlex Web UI of a system for which they are not authorized.
