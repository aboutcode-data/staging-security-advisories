summary: 'Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information
  record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond
  to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for
  removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting
  in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered
  by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether
  a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal
  of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped
  the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to
  the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has
  finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn''t check the success of removing
  the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037
  scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront,
  scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to
  delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related
  data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can
  keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different
  purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access
  in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which
  can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042'
