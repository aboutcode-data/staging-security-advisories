aliases: []
summary: Agno is a multi-agent framework, runtime and control plane. From 2.0.0 to before 2.2.2,
  under high concurrency, when session_state is passed to Agent or Team during run or arun calls,
  a race condition can occur, causing a session_state to be assigned and persisted to the incorrect
  session. This may result in user data from one session being exposed to another user. This
  has been patched in version 2.2.2.
