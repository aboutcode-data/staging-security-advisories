aliases: []
summary: Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to version
  5.17.0, assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed
  in a location different than what was configured. The issue affects front-end forms with `assets`
  fields and other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions
  anyway. Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location,
  and potentially override existing files. Traversal outside an asset container is not possible.
  This path traversal vulnerability has been fixed in 5.17.0.
