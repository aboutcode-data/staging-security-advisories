summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): unanchor URL on usb_submit_urb() error

  In commit 7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix
  URB memory leak"), the URB was re-anchored before usb_submit_urb() in
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() to prevent a leak of this URB during
  cleanup.

  However, this patch did not take into account that usb_submit_urb() could
  fail. The URB remains anchored and
  usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&parent->rx_submitted) in gs_can_close() loops
  infinitely since the anchor list never becomes empty.

  To fix the bug, unanchor the URB when an usb_submit_urb() error occurs,
  also print an info message.
