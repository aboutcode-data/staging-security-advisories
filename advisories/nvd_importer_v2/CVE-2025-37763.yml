aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/imagination: take paired job reference

  For paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the
  geometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until
  the fragment job has finished with it.

  The geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being
  prepared by the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the
  geometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.

  Fixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:
