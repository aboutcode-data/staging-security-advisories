aliases: []
summary: In the latest version of vanna-ai/vanna, the `vanna.ask` function is vulnerable to
  remote code execution due to prompt injection. The root cause is the lack of a sandbox when
  executing LLM-generated code, allowing an attacker to manipulate the code executed by the
  `exec` function in `src/vanna/base/base.py`. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker
  to achieve remote code execution on the app backend server, potentially gaining full control
  of the server.
