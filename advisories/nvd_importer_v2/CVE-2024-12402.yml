aliases: []
summary: The Themes Coder – Create Android & iOS Apps For Your Woocommerce Site plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including,
  1.3.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating
  their password through the update_user_profile() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that
  to gain access to their account.
