summary: 'Microsoft Windows XP SP2 allows local users, who have sessions created by another
  user''s RunAs (run as) command, to kill arbitrary processes of this other user, as demonstrated
  by the taskkill program.  NOTE: the researcher claims a vendor dispute in which the vendor
  states that "RunAs and UAC are convenience features, not security boundaries. If you need
