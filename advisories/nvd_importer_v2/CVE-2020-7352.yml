aliases: []
summary: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges
  in a Windows environment. Due to the software shipping with embedded, static RSA private key,
  an attacker with this key material and local user permissions can effectively send any operating
  system command to the service for execution in this elevated context. The service listens
  for such commands on a locally-bound network port, localhost:9978. A Metasploit module has
  been published which exploits this vulnerability. This issue affects the 2.0.x branch of the
  software (2.0.12 and earlier) as well as the 1.2.x branch (1.2.64 and earlier). A fix was
  issued for the 2.0.x branch of the affected software.
