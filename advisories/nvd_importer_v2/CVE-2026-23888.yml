aliases: []
summary: 'pnpm is a package manager. Prior to version 10.28.1, a path traversal vulnerability
  in pnpm''s binary fetcher allows malicious packages to write files outside the intended extraction
  directory. The vulnerability has two attack vectors: (1) Malicious ZIP entries containing
  `../` or absolute paths that escape the extraction root via AdmZip''s `extractAllTo`, and
  (2) The `BinaryResolution.prefix` field is concatenated into the extraction path without validation,
  allowing a crafted prefix like `../../evil` to redirect extracted files outside `targetDir`.
  The issue impacts all pnpm users who install packages with binary assets, users who configure
  custom Node.js binary locations and CI/CD pipelines that auto-install binary dependencies.
  It can lead to overwriting config files, scripts, or other sensitive files leading to RCE.
  Version 10.28.1 contains a patch.'
