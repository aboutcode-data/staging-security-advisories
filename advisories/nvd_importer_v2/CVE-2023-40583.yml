aliases: []
summary: libp2p is a networking stack and library modularized out of The IPFS Project, and bundled
  separately for other tools to use. In go-libp2p, by using signed peer records a malicious
  actor can store an arbitrary amount of data in a remote node’s memory. This memory does not
  get garbage collected and so the victim can run out of memory and crash. If users of go-libp2p
  in production are not monitoring memory consumption over time, it could be a silent attack
  i.e. the attacker could bring down nodes over a period of time (how long depends on the node
  resources i.e. a go-libp2p node on a virtual server with 4 gb of memory takes about 90 sec
  to bring down; on a larger server, it might take a bit longer.) This issue was patched in
  version 0.27.4.
