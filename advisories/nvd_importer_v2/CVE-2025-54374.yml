summary: 'Eidos is an extensible framework for Personal Data Management. Versions 0.21.0 and
  below contain a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this
  vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted eidos: URL on any website, including a malicious
  one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the browser triggers
  the app’s custom URL handler (eidos:), causing the Eidos application to launch and process
  the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This issue does not have
  a fix as of October 3, 2025'
