aliases: []
summary: In Gradle Enterprise before 2021.3 (and Enterprise Build Cache Node before 10.0), there
  is potential cache poisoning and remote code execution when running the build cache node with
  its default configuration. This configuration allows anonymous access to the configuration
  user interface and anonymous write access to the build cache. If access control to the build
  cache is not changed from the default open configuration, a malicious actor with network access
  can populate the cache with manipulated entries that may execute malicious code as part of
  a build process. This applies to the build cache provided with Gradle Enterprise and the separate
  build cache node service if used. If access control to the user interface is not changed from
  the default open configuration, a malicious actor can undo build cache access control in order
  to populate the cache with manipulated entries that may execute malicious code as part of
  a build process. This does not apply to the build cache provided with Gradle Enterprise, but
  does apply to the separate build cache node service if used.
