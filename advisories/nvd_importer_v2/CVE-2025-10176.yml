aliases: []
summary: The The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the prepare_items function in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which
  can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
