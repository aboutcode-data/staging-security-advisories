aliases: []
summary: The BackWPup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions
  up to, and including, 4.0.1 via the job-specific backup folder. This allows authenticated
  attackers to store backups in arbitrary folders on the server provided they can be written
  to by the server. Additionally, default settings will place an index.php and a .htaccess file
  into the chosen directory (unless already present) when the first backup job is run that are
  intended to prevent directory listing and file access. This means that an attacker could set
  the backup directory to the root of another site in a shared environment and thus disable
  that site.
