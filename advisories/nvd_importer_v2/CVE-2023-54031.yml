summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  vdpa: Add queue index attr to vdpa_nl_policy for nlattr length check

  The vdpa_nl_policy structure is used to validate the nlattr when parsing
  the incoming nlmsg. It will ensure the attribute being described produces
  a valid nlattr pointer in info->attrs before entering into each handler
  in vdpa_nl_ops.

  That is to say, the missing part in vdpa_nl_policy may lead to illegal
  nlattr after parsing, which could lead to OOB read just like CVE-2023-3773.

  This patch adds the missing nla_policy for vdpa queue index attr to avoid
  such bugs.
