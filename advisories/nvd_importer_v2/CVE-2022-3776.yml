summary: The Restaurant Menu – Food Ordering System – Table Reservation plugin for WordPress

  is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions called via AJAX actions
  such as forms_action, set_option, & chosen_options to name a few . This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of administrative actions like modifying
  forms, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link.
