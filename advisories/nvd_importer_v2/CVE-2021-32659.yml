aliases: []
summary: Matrix-appservice-bridge is the bridging service for the Matrix communication program's
  application services. In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling
  turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge`
  instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current
  room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not
  checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any
  malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the
  new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the
  automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the
  `Bridge` class options.
