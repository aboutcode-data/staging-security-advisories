aliases: []
summary: An exploitable information leak vulnerability exists in the ustream-ssl library of
  OpenWrt, versions 18.06.4 and 15.05.1. When connecting to a remote server, the server's SSL
  certificate is checked but no action is taken when the certificate is invalid. An attacker
  could exploit this behavior by performing a man-in-the-middle attack, providing any certificate,
  leading to the theft of all the data sent by the client during the first request.An exploitable
