aliases: []
summary: SysReptor is a fully customizable pentest reporting platform. In versions from 2024.74
  to before 2025.83, authenticated and unprivileged (non-admin) users can assign the is_project_admin
  permission to their own user. This allows users to read, modify and delete pentesting projects
  they are not members of and are therefore not supposed to access. This issue has been patched
  in version 2025.83.
