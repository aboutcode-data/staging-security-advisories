aliases: []
summary: 'Autolab is a course management service, initially developed by a team of students
  at Carnegie Mellon University, that enables instructors to offer autograded programming assignments
  to their students over the Web. A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in Autolab''s
  MOSS functionality, whereby an instructor with access to the feature might be able to execute
  code on the server hosting Autolab. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.10.0.
  As a workaround, disable the MOSS feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of `run_moss`
  in `app/controllers/courses_controller.rb` with `render(plain: "Feature disabled", status:
  :bad_request) && return`.'
