aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the implementation of the H.264 protocol in Cisco Meeting Server
  (CMS) 2.1.4 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  condition on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected application
  does not properly validate Fragmentation Unit (FU-A) protocol packets. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by sending a crafted H.264 FU-A packet through the affected application.
  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected system
  due to an unexpected restart of the CMS media process on the system. Although the CMS platform
  continues to operate and only the single, affected CMS media process is restarted, a brief
  interruption of media traffic for certain users could occur. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve10131.'
