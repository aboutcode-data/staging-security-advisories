summary: The Post Carousel & Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the plugin's 'post-cs' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
