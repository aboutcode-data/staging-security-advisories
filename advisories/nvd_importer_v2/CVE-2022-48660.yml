  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpiolib: cdev: Set lineevent_state::irq after IRQ register successfully

  When running gpio test on nxp-ls1028 platform with below command
  gpiomon --num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip1 25
  There will be a warning trace as below:
  Call trace:
  free_irq+0x204/0x360
  lineevent_free+0x64/0x70
  gpio_ioctl+0x598/0x6a0
  __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xb4/0x100
  invoke_syscall+0x5c/0x130
  ......
  el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4
  The reason of this issue is that calling request_threaded_irq()
  function failed, and then lineevent_free() is invoked to release
  the resource. Since the lineevent_state::irq was already set, so
  the subsequent invocation of free_irq() would trigger the above
  warning call trace. To fix this issue, set the lineevent_state::irq
  after the IRQ register successfully.
