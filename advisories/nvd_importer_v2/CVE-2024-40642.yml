aliases: []
summary: The netty incubator codec.bhttp is a java language binary http parser. In affected
  versions the `BinaryHttpParser` class does not properly validate input values thus giving
  attackers almost complete control over the HTTP requests constructed from the parsed output.
  Attackers can abuse several issues individually to perform various injection attacks including
  HTTP request smuggling, desync attacks, HTTP header injections, request queue poisoning, caching
  attacks and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Attacker could also combine several issues
  to create well-formed messages for other text-based protocols which may result in attacks
  beyond the HTTP protocol. The BinaryHttpParser class implements the readRequestHead method
  which performs most of the relevant parsing of the received request. The data structure prefixes
  values with a variable length integer value. The parsing code below first gets the lengths
  of the values from the prefixed variable length integer. After it has all of the lengths and
  calculates all of the indices, the parser casts the applicable slices of the ByteBuf to String.
  Finally, it passes these values into a new `DefaultBinaryHttpRequest` object where no further
  parsing or validation occurs. Method is partially validated while other values are not validated
  at all. Software that relies on netty to apply input validation for binary HTTP data may be
  vulnerable to various injection and protocol based attacks. This issue has been addressed
  in version 0.0.13.Final. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this vulnerability.
