  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/mlx5: fix potential memory leak in mlx5e_init_rep_rx

  The memory pointed to by the priv->rx_res pointer is not freed in the error
  path of mlx5e_init_rep_rx, which can lead to a memory leak. Fix by freeing
  the memory in the error path, thereby making the error path identical to
  mlx5e_cleanup_rep_rx().
