summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in smc_clc_prfx_match().

  smc_clc_prfx_match() is called from smc_listen_work() and
  not under RCU nor RTNL.

  Using sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.

  Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu().

  Note that the returned value of smc_clc_prfx_match() is not
  used in the caller.
