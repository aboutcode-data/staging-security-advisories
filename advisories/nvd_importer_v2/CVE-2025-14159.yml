aliases: []
summary: The Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.2. This is due to
  missing nonce validation on the 'ays_sccp_results_export_file' AJAX action. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive plugin data including email addresses,
  IP addresses, physical addresses, user IDs, and other user information via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link. The exported data is stored in a publicly accessible file, allowing attackers to receive
  the sensitive information even though they are not authenticated.
