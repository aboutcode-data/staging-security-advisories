summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: hci_event: Ignore multiple conn complete events

  When one of the three connection complete events is received multiple
  times for the same handle, the device is registered multiple times which
  leads to memory corruptions. Therefore, consequent events for a single
  connection are ignored.

  The conn->state can hold different values, therefore HCI_CONN_HANDLE_UNSET
  is introduced to identify new connections. To make sure the events do not
  contain this or another invalid handle HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX and checks
  are introduced.
