aliases: []
summary: The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option
  spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions
  to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter
  can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious
  user might then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a
  Unix shell command based on their input, and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell
  command execution as the user Spark is currently running as. This affects Apache Spark versions
  3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.
