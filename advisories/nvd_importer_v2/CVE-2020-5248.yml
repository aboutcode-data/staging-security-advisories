aliases: []
summary: GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption
  key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive
  data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on
  existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know
  which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the
  key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again
  from the UI will work.
