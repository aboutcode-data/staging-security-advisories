aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ksmbd: avoid out of bounds access in decode_preauth_ctxt()

  Confirm that the accessed pneg_ctxt->HashAlgorithms address sits within
  the SMB request boundary; deassemble_neg_contexts() only checks that the
  eight byte smb2_neg_context header + (client controlled) DataLength are
  within the packet boundary, which is insufficient.

  Checking for sizeof(struct smb2_preauth_neg_context) is overkill given
  that the type currently assumes SMB311_SALT_SIZE bytes of trailing Salt.
