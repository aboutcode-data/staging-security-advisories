aliases: []
summary: Homarr is an open-source dashboard. Prior to 1.52.0, a public (unauthenticated) tRPC
  endpoint widget.app.ping accepts an arbitrary url and performs a server-side request to that
  URL. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger outbound HTTP requests from the Homarr
  server, enabling SSRF behavior and a reliable port-scanning primitive (open vs closed ports
  can be inferred from statusCode vs fetch failed and timing). This vulnerability is fixed in
  1.52.0.
