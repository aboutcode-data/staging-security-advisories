aliases: []
summary: Zed, a code editor, has an aribtrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior
  to 0.218.2-pre. The Zed IDE loads Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations from the `settings.json`
  file located within a project’s `.zed` subdirectory. A malicious MCP configuration can contain
  arbitrary shell commands that run on the host system with the privileges of the user running
  the IDE. This can be triggered automatically without any user interaction besides opening
  the project in the IDE. Version 0.218.2-pre fixes the issue by implementing worktree trust
  mechanism. As a workaround, users should carefully review the contents of project settings
  files (`./zed/settings.json`) before opening new projects in Zed.
