aliases: []
summary: On Windows endpoints, the SecureConnector agent must run under the local SYSTEM account
  or another administrator account in order to enable full functionality of the agent. The typical
  configuration is for the agent to run as a Windows service under the local SYSTEM account.
  The SecureConnector agent runs various plugin scripts and executables on the endpoint in order
  to gather and report information about the host to the CounterACT management appliance. The
  SecureConnector agent downloads these scripts and executables as needed from the CounterACT
  management appliance and runs them on the endpoint. The SecureConnector agent fails to set
  any permissions on downloaded file objects. This allows a malicious user to take ownership
  of any of these files and make modifications to it, regardless of where the files are saved.
  These files are then executed under SYSTEM privileges. A malicious unprivileged user can overwrite
  these executable files with malicious code before the SecureConnector agent executes them,
  causing the malicious code to be run under the SYSTEM account.
