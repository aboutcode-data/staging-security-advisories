summary: 'Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that
  for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done
  by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning
  with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110, CVE-2024-12326 and CVE-2025-7066),
  video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated HTTP
  request with an invalid MIME type like image. When doing the preview, the browser tries to
  automatically detect the MIME type resulting in detecting SVG and possibly executing JavaScript
  code. To prevent this, MIME sniffing is disabled by sending the HTTP header X-Content-Type-Options:
  nosniff.'
