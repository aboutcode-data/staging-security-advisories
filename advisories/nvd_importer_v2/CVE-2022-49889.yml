summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ring-buffer: Check for NULL cpu_buffer in ring_buffer_wake_waiters()

  On some machines the number of listed CPUs may be bigger than the actual
  CPUs that exist. The tracing subsystem allocates a per_cpu directory with
  access to the per CPU ring buffer via a cpuX file. But to save space, the
  ring buffer will only allocate buffers for online CPUs, even though the
  CPU array will be as big as the nr_cpu_ids.

  With the addition of waking waiters on the ring buffer when closing the
  file, the ring_buffer_wake_waiters() now needs to make sure that the
  buffer is allocated (with the irq_work allocated with it) before trying to
  wake waiters, as it will cause a NULL pointer dereference.

  While debugging this, I added a NULL check for the buffer itself (which is
  OK to do), and also NULL pointer checks against buffer->buffers (which is
  not fine, and will WARN) as well as making sure the CPU number passed in
  is within the nr_cpu_ids (which is also not fine if it isn't).
