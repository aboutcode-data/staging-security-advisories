summary: The Total Upkeep plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions
  up to, and including 1.14.13. This is due to missing authorization on the heartbeat_received()
  function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently
  be used to download the back-up.
