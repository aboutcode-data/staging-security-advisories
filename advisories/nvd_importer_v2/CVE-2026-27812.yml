aliases: []
summary: Sub2API is an AI API gateway platform designed to distribute and manage API quotas
  from AI product subscriptions. A vulnerability in versions prior to 0.1.85 is a Password Reset
  Poisoning (Host Header / Forwarded Header trust issue), which allows attackers to manipulate
  the password reset link. Attackers can exploit this flaw to inject their own domain into the
  password reset link, leading to the potential for account takeover. The vulnerability has
  been fixed in version v0.1.85. If upgrading is not immediately possible, users can mitigate
  the vulnerability by disabling the "forgot password" feature until an upgrade to a patched
  version can be performed. This will prevent attackers from exploiting the vulnerability via
  the affected endpoint.
