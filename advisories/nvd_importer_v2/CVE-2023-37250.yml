aliases: []
summary: Unity Parsec has a TOCTOU race condition that permits local attackers to escalate privileges
  to SYSTEM if Parsec was installed in "Per User" mode. The application intentionally launches
  DLLs from a user-owned directory but intended to always perform integrity verification of
  those DLLs. This affects Parsec Loader versions through 8. Parsec Loader 9 is a fixed version.
