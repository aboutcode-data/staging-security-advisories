aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services
  Platform Collector (CSPC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct
  a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities
  are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click
  a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script
  code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
