aliases: []
summary: The Simple Registration for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.8. This is due to missing nonce
  validation on the role requests admin page handler in the includes/display-role-admin.php
  file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve pending role requests
  and escalate user privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
