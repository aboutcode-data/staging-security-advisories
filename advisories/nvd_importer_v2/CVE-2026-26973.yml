aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1,
  and 2026.2.0 have an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) in `ReviewableNotesController`.
  When `enable_category_group_moderation` is enabled, a user belonging to a  category moderation
  group can create or delete their own notes on **any** reviewable in the system, including
  reviewables in categories they do not moderate. The controller used an unscoped `Reviewable.find`
  and the `ensure_can_see` guard only checked whether the user could access the review queue
  in general, not whether they could access the specific reviewable. Only instances with `enable_category_group_moderation`
  enabled are affected. Staff users (admins/moderators) are not impacted as they already have
  access to all reviewables. The issue is patched in versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0
  by scoping the reviewable lookup through `Reviewable.viewable_by(current_user)`. As a workaround,
  disable the `enable_category_group_moderation` site setting. This removes the attack surface
  as only staff users will have access to the review queue.
