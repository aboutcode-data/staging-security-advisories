aliases: []
summary: 'A critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was found all recent
  versions of Apache Tapestry. The affected versions include 5.4.5, 5.5.0, 5.6.2 and 5.7.0.
  The vulnerability I have found is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195. Recap: Before the
  fix of CVE-2019-0195 it was possible to download arbitrary class files from the classpath
  by providing a crafted asset file URL. An attacker was able to download the file `AppModule.class`
  by requesting the URL `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class` which
  contains a HMAC secret key. The fix for that bug was a blacklist filter that checks if the
  URL ends with `.class`, `.properties` or `.xml`. Bypass: Unfortunately, the blacklist solution
  can simply be bypassed by appending a `/` at the end of the URL: `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/`
  The slash is stripped after the blacklist check and the file `AppModule.class` is loaded into
  the response. This class usually contains the HMAC secret key which is used to sign serialized
  Java objects. With the knowledge of that key an attacker can sign a Java gadget chain that
  leads to RCE (e.g. CommonsBeanUtils1 from ysoserial). Solution for this vulnerability: * For
  Apache Tapestry 5.4.0 to 5.6.1, upgrade to 5.6.2 or later. * For Apache Tapestry 5.7.0, upgrade
  to 5.7.1 or later.'
