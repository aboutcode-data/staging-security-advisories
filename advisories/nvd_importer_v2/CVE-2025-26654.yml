aliases: []
summary: SAP Commerce Cloud (Public Cloud) does not allow to disable unencrypted HTTP (port
  80) entirely, but instead allows a redirect from port 80 to 443 (HTTPS). As a result, Commerce
  normally communicates securely over HTTPS. However, the confidentiality and integrity of data
  sent on the first request before the redirect may be impacted if the client is configured
  to use HTTP and sends confidential data on the first request before the redirect.
