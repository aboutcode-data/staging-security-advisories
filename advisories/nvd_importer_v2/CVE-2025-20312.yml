summary: "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco\
  \ IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper error\
  \ handling when parsing a specific SNMP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending a specific SNMP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability affects SNMP versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit this vulnerability\
  \ through SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker must know a valid read-write or read-only SNMP\
  \ community string for the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv3,\
  \ the attacker must have valid SNMP user credentials for the affected system."
