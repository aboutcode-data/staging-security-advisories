aliases: []
summary: The Registration & Login with Mobile Phone Number for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This is
  due to the plugin not properly verifying a users identity prior to authenticating them via
  the fma_lwp_set_session_php_fun() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to authenticate as any user on the site, including administrators, without a valid password.
