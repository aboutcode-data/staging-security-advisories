summary: "A vulnerability in the session management system of the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager\
  \ multi-tenant feature could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access another tenant\
  \ that is being managed by the same Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager instance. This vulnerability\
  \ requires the multi-tenant feature to be enabled.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient\
  \ user session management within the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager system. An attacker could\
  \ exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected system. A successful\

  \ tenant, make configuration changes, or possibly take a tenant offline causing a denial of\
  \ service condition."
