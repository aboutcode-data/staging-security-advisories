  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  parisc: Fix random data corruption from exception handler

  The current exception handler implementation, which assists when accessing
  user space memory, may exhibit random data corruption if the compiler decides
  to use a different register than the specified register %r29 (defined in
  ASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG) for the error code. If the compiler choose another
  register, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 and thus
  trash whatever this register is used for.
  Looking at the assembly I found that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd().

  To solve the issue, the easiest solution would be if it somehow is
  possible to tell the fault handler which register is used to hold the error
  code. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it will show
  up as e.g. %r29 (with the "%r" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not
  convert to an integer.

  This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach:
  We extend the __ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word.
  In this word we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction
  "or %r0,%r0,%reg", where %reg references the register which the compiler
  choosed for the error return code.
  In case of an access failure, the fault handler finds the __ex_table entry and
  can examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the lowest 5 bits, and
  the fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.

  Since we extend the __ex_table to 3 words we can't use the BUILDTIME_TABLE_SORT
  config option any longer.
