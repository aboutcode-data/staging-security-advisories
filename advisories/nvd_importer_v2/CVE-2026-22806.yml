aliases: []
summary: vCluster Platform provides a Kubernetes platform for managing virtual clusters, multi-tenancy,
  and cluster sharing. Prior to versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10, when an access key
  is created with a limited scope, the scope can be bypassed to access resources outside of
  it. However, the user still cannot access resources beyond what is accessible to the owner
  of the access key. Versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10 fix the vulnerability. Some other
  mitigations are available. Users can limit exposure by reviewing access keys which are scoped
  and ensuring any users with access to them have appropriate permissions set. Creating automation
  users with very limited permissions and using access keys for these automation users can be
  used as a temporary workaround where upgrading is not immediately possible but scoped access
  keys are needed.
