aliases: []
summary: The Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.14.0. This is due to the unsafe application of the
  `ninja_forms_merge_tags` filter to user-supplied input within repeater fields, which allows
  the resolution of `{post_meta:KEY}` merge tags without authorization checks. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract arbitrary post metadata from any post on
  the site, including sensitive data such as WooCommerce billing emails, API keys, private tokens,
  and customer personal information via the `nf_ajax_submit` AJAX action.
