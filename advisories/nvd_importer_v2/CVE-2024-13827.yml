aliases: []
summary: The Razorpay Subscription Button Elementor Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg() and remove_query_arg()
  functions without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
