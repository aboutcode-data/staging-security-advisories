summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/bridge: it6505: Initialize AUX channel in it6505_i2c_probe

  During device boot, the HPD interrupt could be triggered before the DRM
  subsystem registers it6505 as a DRM bridge. In such cases, the driver
  tries to access AUX channel and causes NULL pointer dereference.
  Initializing the AUX channel earlier to prevent such error.
