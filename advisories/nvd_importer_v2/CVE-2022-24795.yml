aliases: []
summary: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch
  and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory
  corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64`
  may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000
  (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk.
  These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents
  the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering
  on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated
  heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability
  mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution
  is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As
  a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.
