  ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED **

  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Apache Archiva.

  This issue affects Apache Archiva: from 2.0.0.

  As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users. Alternatively, you could configure a HTTP proxy in front of your Archiva instance to only forward requests that do not have malicious characters in the URL.

  NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
