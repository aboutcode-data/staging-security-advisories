summary: The Dropbox Folder Share for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions
  up to, and including, 1.9.7 via the editor-view.php file. This allows unauthenticated attackers

  in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
