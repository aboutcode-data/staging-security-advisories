aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the CloudForms account configuration when using VMware. By default,
  a shared account is used that has privileged access to VMRC (VMWare Remote Console) functions
  that may not be appropriate for users of CloudForms (and thus this account). An attacker could
  use this vulnerability to view and make changes to settings in the VMRC and virtual machines
  controlled by it that they should not have access to.
