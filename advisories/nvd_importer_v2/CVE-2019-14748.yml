aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1. The Ticket
  creation form allows users to upload files along with queries. It was found that the file-upload
  functionality has fewer (or no) mitigations implemented for file content checks; also, the
  output is not handled properly, causing persistent XSS that leads to cookie stealing or malicious
  actions. For example, a non-agent user can upload a .html file, and Content-Disposition will
  be set to inline instead of attachment.
