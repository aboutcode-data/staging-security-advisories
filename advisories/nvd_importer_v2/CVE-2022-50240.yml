summary: "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nandroid: binder:\
  \ stop saving a pointer to the VMA\n\nDo not record a pointer to a VMA outside of the mmap_lock\
  \ for later use. \nThis is unsafe and there are a number of failure paths *after* the\nrecorded\
  \ VMA pointer may be freed during setup.  There is no callback to\nthe driver to clear the\
  \ saved pointer from generic mm code.  Furthermore,\nthe VMA pointer may become stale if any\
  \ number of VMA operations end up\nfreeing the VMA so saving it was fragile to being with.\n\
  \nInstead, change the binder_alloc struct to record the start address of the\nVMA and use\
  \ vma_lookup() to get the vma when needed.  Add lockdep\nmmap_lock checks on updates to the\
  \ vma pointer to ensure the lock is held\nand depend on that lock for synchronization of readers\
  \ and writers - which\nwas already the case anyways, so the smp_wmb()/smp_rmb() was not\n\
  necessary.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix drivers/android/binder_alloc_selftest.c]"
