summary: 'Rejected reason: Buffer overflow in the (1) sysfs_show_available_clocksources and
  (2) sysfs_show_current_clocksources functions in Linux kernel 2.6.23 and earlier might allow
  local users to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via crafted clock source
  names.  NOTE: follow-on analysis by Linux developers states that "There is no way for unprivileged
  users (or really even the root user) to add new clocksources.'
