aliases: []
summary: In Eclipse Buildship versions prior to 3.1.1, the build files indicate that this project
  is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Any of these artifacts could have been
  MITM to maliciously compromise them and infect the build artifacts that were produced. Additionally,
  if any of these JARs or other dependencies were compromised, any developers using these could
  continue to be infected past updating to fix this.
