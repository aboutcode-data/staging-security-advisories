summary: "A vulnerability in the IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) packet processing of Cisco Access\
  \ Point Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to modify the IPv6 gateway\
  \ on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the processing\
  \ of IPv6 RA packets that are received from wireless clients. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by associating to a wireless network and sending a series of crafted IPv6\
  \ RA packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily change the IPv6\
  \ gateway of an affected device. This could also lead to intermittent packet loss for any\
  \ wireless clients that are associated with the affected device."
