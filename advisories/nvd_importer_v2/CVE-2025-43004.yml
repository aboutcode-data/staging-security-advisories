aliases: []
summary: Due to a security misconfiguration vulnerability, customers can develop Production
  Operator Dashboards (PODs) that enable outside users to access customer data when they access
  these dashboards. Since no mechanisms exist to enforce authentication, malicious unauthenticated
  users can view non-sensitive customer information. However, this does not affect data integrity
  or availability.
