aliases: []
summary: October is a Content Management System (CMS) and web platform to assist with development
  workflow. An authenticated backend user with the `editor.cms_pages`, `editor.cms_layouts`,
  or `editor.cms_partials` permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code
  to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.safe_mode` being enabled can craft a special request
  to include PHP code in the CMS template. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.15.
