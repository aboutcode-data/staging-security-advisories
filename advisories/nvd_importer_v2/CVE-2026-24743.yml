aliases: []
summary: InvoicePlane is a self-hosted open source application for managing invoices, clients,
  and payments. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability occurs in the upload Invoice
  Logo functions of InvoicePlane version 1.7.0. The Upload Invoice Logo function allows the
  application to upload svg files. Although administrator privileges are required to exploit
  it, this is still considered a critical vulnerability as it can cause actions such as unauthorized
  modification of application data, creation of persistent backdoors through stored malicious
  scripts, and full compromise of the application's integrity. Version 1.7.1 patches the issue.
