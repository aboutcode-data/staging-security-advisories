aliases: []
summary: The YITH WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 4.10.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
  that a user is authorized to perform actions on the REST API /wp-json/yith/wishlist/v1/lists
  endpoint (which uses permission_callback => '__return_true') and the AJAX delete_item handler
  (which only checks nonce validity without verifying object-level authorization). This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to disclose wishlist tokens for any user and subsequently
  delete wishlist items by chaining the REST API authorization bypass with the exposed delete_item
  nonce on shared wishlist pages and the AJAX handler's missing object-level authorization check.
