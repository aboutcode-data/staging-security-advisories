summary: ClickHouse® is an open-source column-oriented database management system that allows
  generating analytical data reports in real-time. A heap buffer overflow issue was discovered
  in ClickHouse server. An attacker could send a specially crafted payload to the native interface
  exposed by default on port 9000/tcp, triggering a bug in the decompression logic of T64 codec
  that crashes the ClickHouse server process. This attack does not require authentication. Note
  that this exploit can also be triggered via HTTP protocol, however, the attacker will need
  a valid credential as the HTTP authentication take places first. This issue has been fixed
  in version 23.10.2.13-stable, 23.9.4.11-stable, 23.8.6.16-lts and 23.3.16.7-lts.
