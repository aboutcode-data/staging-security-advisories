aliases: []
summary: 'The Truelysell Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password
  Change in versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled
  access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over
  administrator accounts. Note: This can only be exploited unauthenticated if the attacker knows
  which page contains the ''truelysell_edit_staff'' shortcode.'
