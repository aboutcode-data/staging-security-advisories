aliases: []
summary: SharpCompress is a fully managed C# library to deal with many compression types and
  formats. Versions prior to 0.29.0 are vulnerable to partial path traversal. SharpCompress
  recreates a hierarchy of directories under destinationDirectory if ExtractFullPath is set
  to true in options. In order to prevent extraction outside the destination directory the destinationFileName
  path is verified to begin with fullDestinationDirectoryPath. However, prior to version 0.29.0,
  it is not enforced that fullDestinationDirectoryPath ends with slash. If the destinationDirectory
  is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name
  thats begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`.
  Because of the file name and destination directory constraints the arbitrary file creation
  impact is limited and depends on the use case. This issue is fixed in SharpCompress version
  0.29.0.
