aliases: []
summary: In Apache Karaf version prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, when the webconsole feature is
  installed in Karaf, it is available at .../system/console and requires authentication to access
  it. One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line
  console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at .../system/console/gogo.
  Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some
  applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and
  perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/,
  and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A
  mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed
  with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console
  application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the
  Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their
  functionality would be reduced/compromised.
