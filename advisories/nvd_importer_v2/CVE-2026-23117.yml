  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ice: add missing ice_deinit_hw() in devlink reinit path

  devlink-reload results in ice_init_hw failed error, and then removing
  the ice driver causes a NULL pointer dereference.

  [  +0.102213] ice 0000:ca:00.0: ice_init_hw failed: -16
  ...
  [  +0.000001] Call Trace:
  [  +0.000003]  <TASK>
  [  +0.000006]  ice_unload+0x8f/0x100 [ice]
  [  +0.000081]  ice_remove+0xba/0x300 [ice]

  Commit 1390b8b3d2be ("ice: remove duplicate call to ice_deinit_hw() on
  error paths") removed ice_deinit_hw() from ice_deinit_dev(). As a result
  ice_devlink_reinit_down() no longer calls ice_deinit_hw(), but
  ice_devlink_reinit_up() still calls ice_init_hw(). Since the control
  queues are not uninitialized, ice_init_hw() fails with -EBUSY.

  Add ice_deinit_hw() to ice_devlink_reinit_down() to correspond with
  ice_init_hw() in ice_devlink_reinit_up().
