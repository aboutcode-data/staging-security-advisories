aliases: []
summary: 'Riverbed RiOS through 9.6.0 has a weak default password for the secure vault, which
  makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism
  by leveraging knowledge of the password algorithm and the appliance serial number. NOTE: the
  vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a vulnerability. The product contains
  correct computational logic for supporting arbitrary password changes by customers; however,
  a password change is optional to meet different customers'' needs'
