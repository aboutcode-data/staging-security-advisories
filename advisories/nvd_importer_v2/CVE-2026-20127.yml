summary: "A vulnerability in the peering authentication in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller,\
  \ formerly SD-WAN vSmart, and Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly SD-WAN vManage, could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and obtain administrative\
  \ privileges on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the peering authentication\
  \ mechanism in an affected system is not working properly. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by sending crafted requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to log in to an affected Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller as an internal,\
  \ high-privileged, non-root&nbsp;user account. Using this account, the attacker could access\
  \ NETCONF, which would then allow the attacker to manipulate network configuration for the\
  \ SD-WAN fabric.&nbsp;"
