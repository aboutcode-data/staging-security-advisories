aliases: []
summary: pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker who uses a vulnerability
  present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop.
  This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by
  100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user
  manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations.
  The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0. As a workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying
  `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`.
