aliases: []
summary: Hatching Triage Sandbox Windows 10 build 2004 (2025-08-14) and Windows 10 LTSC 2021(2025-08-14)
  contains a vulnerability in its Windows behavioral analysis engine that allows a submitted
  malware sample to evade detection and cause denial-of-analysis. The vulnerability is triggered
  when a sample recursively spawns a large number of child processes, generating high log volume
  and exhausting system resources. As a result, key malicious behavior, including PowerShell
  execution and reverse shell activity, may not be recorded or reported, misleading analysts
  and compromising the integrity and availability of sandboxed analysis results.
