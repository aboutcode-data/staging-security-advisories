summary: 'A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Software AG WebMethods 10.11.x/10.15.x.
  Affected is an unknown function of the file wm.server/connect/. The manipulation leads to
  improper access controls. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. To access a file like
  /assets/ a popup may request username and password. By just clicking CANCEL you will be redirected
  to the directory. If you visited /invoke/wm.server/connect, you''ll be able to see details
  like internal IPs, ports, and versions. In some cases if access to /assets/ is refused, you
  may enter /assets/x as a wrong value, then come back to /assets/ which we will show the requested
  data. It appears that insufficient access control is depending on referrer header data. VDB-247158
  is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about
  this disclosure but did not respond in any way.'
