aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions
  of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 and prior to 2.3.13, 2.4.19, 2.5.6, and 2.6.0-rc-3  are vulnerable
  to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens. OIDC providers
  include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that claim specifies the
  intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept
  the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC
  provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience claim, so it will accept tokens that
  are not intended for Argo CD. If Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences
  (for example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of
  those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups`
  claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD. This bug also increases
  the impact of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid token for a different audience,
  they can use it to access Argo CD. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions
  2.6.0-rc3, 2.5.6, 2.4.19, and 2.3.13. There are no workarounds.
