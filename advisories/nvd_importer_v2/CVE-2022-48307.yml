aliases: []
summary: It was discovered that the Magritte-ftp was not verifying hostnames in TLS certificates
  due to a misuse of the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory API. A malicious attacker in a privileged
  network position could abuse this to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. A successful man-in-the-middle
  attack would allow them to intercept, read, or modify network communications to and from the
  affected service. In the case of a successful man in the middle attack on magritte-ftp, an
  attacker would be able to read and modify network traffic such as authentication tokens or
  raw data entering a Palantir Foundry stack.
