  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  char: applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl

  Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

  In ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid
  RamIO pointer are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function
  unconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO + VERS) at the
  end.

  If cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist
  (where RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

  Fix this by skipping the readb access when cmd is 6, as this
  command is a global information query and does not target a specific
  board context.
