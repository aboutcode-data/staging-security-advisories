aliases: []
summary: 'Snowflake JDBC provides a JDBC type 4 driver that supports core functionality, allowing
  Java program to connect to Snowflake. Users of the Snowflake JDBC driver were vulnerable to
  a command injection vulnerability. An attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible
  server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked
  a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would
  render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. The vulnerability was patched
  on March 17, 2023 as part of Snowflake JDBC driver Version 3.13.29. All users should immediately
  upgrade the Snowflake JDBC driver to the latest version: 3.13.29.'
