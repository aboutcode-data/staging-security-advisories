aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting
  with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink
  following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files
  from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which
  is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an
  out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other
  Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption
  plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server.
  A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15.
  Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may
  disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.
