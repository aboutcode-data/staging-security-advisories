aliases: []
summary: '@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default Backstage software
  templates. In affected versions a malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder
  template is able to manipulate the template in a way that writes files to arbitrary paths
  on the scaffolder-backend host instance. This vulnerability can in some situation also be
  exploited through user input when executing a template, meaning you do not need write access
  to the templates. This method will not allow the attacker to control the contents of the injected
  file however, unless the template is also crafted in a specific way that gives control of
  the file contents. This vulnerability is fixed in version `0.15.14` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.
  This attack is mitigated by restricting access and requiring reviews when registering or modifying
  scaffolder templates.'
