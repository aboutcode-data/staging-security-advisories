  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tee: fix register_shm_helper()

  In register_shm_helper(), fix incorrect error handling for a call to
  iov_iter_extract_pages(). A case is missing for when
  iov_iter_extract_pages() only got some pages and return a number larger
  than 0, but not the requested amount.

  This fixes a possible NULL pointer dereference following a bad input from
  ioctl(TEE_IOC_SHM_REGISTER) where parts of the buffer isn't mapped.
