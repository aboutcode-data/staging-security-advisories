aliases: []
summary: text-generation-webui is an open-source web interface for running Large Language Models.
  In versions through 3.13, a Local File Inclusion vulnerability exists in the character picture
  upload feature. An attacker can upload a text file containing a symbolic link to an arbitrary
  file path. When the application processes the upload, it follows the symbolic link and serves
  the contents of the targeted file through the web interface. This allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing system configurations,
  credentials, and other confidential information. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14. No known
  workarounds exist.
