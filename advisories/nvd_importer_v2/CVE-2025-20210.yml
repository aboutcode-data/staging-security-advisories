summary: "A vulnerability in the management API of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA\
  \ Center, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read and modify the outgoing\
  \ proxy configuration settings.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication\
  \ in an API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to\
  \ the affected API of a Catalyst Center device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to view or modify the outgoing proxy configuration, which could disrupt internet traffic\
  \ from Cisco Catalyst Center or may allow the attacker to intercept outbound internet traffic."
