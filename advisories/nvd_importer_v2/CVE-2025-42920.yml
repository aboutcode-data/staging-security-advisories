aliases: []
summary: Due to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SAP Supplier Relationship
  Management, an unauthenticated attacker could generate a malicious link and make it publicly
  accessible. If an authenticated victim clicks on the link, the injected input is processed
  during the page generation, resulting in the execution of malicious content. This execution
  allows the attacker to access and modify information within the victim's browser scope, impacting
  confidentiality and integrity, while availability remains unaffected.
