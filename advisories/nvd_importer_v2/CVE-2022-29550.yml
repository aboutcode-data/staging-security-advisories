aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Qualys Cloud Agent 4.8.0-49. It writes "ps auxwwe" output
  to the /var/log/qualys/qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log file. This may, for example, unexpectedly
  write credentials (from environment variables) to disk in cleartext. NOTE: there are no common
  circumstances in which qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log can be read by a user other than root;
  however, the file contents could be exposed through site-specific operational practices. The
  vendor does NOT characterize this as a vulnerability because the ps data collection is intentional,
  and would only capture credentials on a machine that was already affected by the CWE-214 weakness'
