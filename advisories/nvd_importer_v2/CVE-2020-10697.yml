aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Ansible Tower when running Openshift. Tower runs a memcached, which
  is accessed via TCP. An attacker can take advantage of writing a playbook polluting this cache,
  causing a denial of service attack. This attack would not completely stop the service, but
  in the worst-case scenario, it can reduce the Tower performance, for which memcached is designed.
  Theoretically, more sophisticated attacks can be performed by manipulating and crafting the
  cache, as Tower relies on memcached as a place to pull out setting values. Confidential and
  sensitive data stored in memcached should not be pulled, as this information is encrypted.
  This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4, Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6
  and Ansible Tower versions before 3.4.6.
