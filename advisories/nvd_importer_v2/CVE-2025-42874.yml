summary: SAP NetWeaver remote service for Xcelsius allows an attacker with network access and
  high privileges to execute arbitrary code on the affected system due to insufficient input
  validation and improper handling of remote method calls. Exploitation does not require user
  interaction and could lead to service disruption or unauthorized system control. This has
  high impact on integrity and availability, with no impact on confidentiality.
