aliases: []
summary: Deltek Vision 7.x before 7.6 permits the execution of any attacker supplied SQL statement
  through a custom RPC over HTTP protocol. The Vision system relies on the client binary to
  enforce security rules and integrity of SQL statements and other content being sent to the
  server. Client HTTP calls can be manipulated by one of several means to execute arbitrary
  SQL statements (similar to SQLi) or possibly have unspecified other impact via this custom
  protocol. To perform these attacks an authenticated session is first required. In some cases
  client calls are obfuscated by encryption, which can be bypassed due to hard-coded keys and
  an insecure key rotation protocol. Impacts may include remote code execution in some deployments;
  however, the vendor states that this cannot occur when the installation documentation is heeded.
