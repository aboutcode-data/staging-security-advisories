aliases: []
summary: The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due
  to insufficient file path validation in the woffice_file_manager_delete() function in all
  versions up to, and including, 5.4.26. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can
  easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
