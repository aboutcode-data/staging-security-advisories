summary: 'Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime.
  Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow
  path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The
  original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under
  certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction
  depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive
  endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality
  impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact
  may be high, otherwise it may be moderate. This issue is fixed in version 4.9.6.'
