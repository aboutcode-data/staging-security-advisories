summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center\
  \ Management Portal (Unified CCMP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct\
  \ a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate\
  \ user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of\
  \ the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to\
  \ execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive\
  \ browser-based information."
