datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13742
aliases: []
summary: The iControlWP – Multiple WordPress Site Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.5 via deserialization of
  untrusted input from the reqpars parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means
  this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is
  installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
  on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files,
  retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.
