aliases: []
summary: XSS in /dashboard/blocks/stacks/view_details/ - old browsers only. When using an older
  browser with built-in XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are
  outputted can be exploited for Concrete 8.5.7 and below as well as Concrete 9.0 through 9.0.2
  to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input
  escape mechanism. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 3.1with CVSS v3.1 Vector
