aliases: []
summary: The WatchTowerHQ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read via the
  'wht_download_big_object_origin' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.15.0. This
  is due to insufficient path validation in the handle_big_object_download_request function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and a
  valid access token, to read arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information
  such as database credentials and authentication keys.
