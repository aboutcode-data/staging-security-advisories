aliases: []
summary: The Payment Plugins Braintree For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wc-braintree/v1/3ds/vaulted_nonce
  REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.78. This is due to the endpoint
  being registered with permission_callback set to __return_true and processing user-supplied
  token IDs without verifying ownership or authentication. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to retrieve payment method nonces for any stored payment token in the system, which
  can be used to create fraudulent transactions, charge customer credit cards, or attach payment
  methods to other subscriptions.
