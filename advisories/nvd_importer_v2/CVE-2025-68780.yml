  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  sched/deadline: only set free_cpus for online runqueues

  Commit 16b269436b72 ("sched/deadline: Modify cpudl::free_cpus
  to reflect rd->online") introduced the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu
  functions to allow the cpu_dl::free_cpus mask to be manipulated
  by the deadline scheduler class rq_on/offline callbacks so the
  mask would also reflect this state.

  Commit 9659e1eeee28 ("sched/deadline: Remove cpu_active_mask
  from cpudl_find()") removed the check of the cpu_active_mask to
  save some processing on the premise that the cpudl::free_cpus
  mask already reflected the runqueue online state.

  Unfortunately, there are cases where it is possible for the
  cpudl_clear function to set the free_cpus bit for a CPU when the
  deadline runqueue is offline. When this occurs while a CPU is
  connected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad
  state after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU
  that is transitioning through the default root domain may push a
  deadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its
  free_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the
  opportunity to run.

  One example is outlined here:
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com

  Another occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a
  CPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of
  the deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear
  and set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.

  This commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the
  online state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask
  can be updated appropriately.

  It is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the
  cpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu
  functions are removed. In addition, since the free_cpus mask is
  now only updated under the cpudl lock the code was changed to
  use the non-atomic __cpumask functions.
