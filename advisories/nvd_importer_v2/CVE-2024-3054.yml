aliases: []
summary: WPvivid Backup & Migration Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHAR Deserialization
  in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.99 via deserialization of untrusted input at the
  wpvividstg_get_custom_exclude_path_free action. This is due to the plugin not providing sufficient
  path validation on the tree_node[node][id] parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with admin-level access and above, to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will
  deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable
  plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
  system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or
  execute code.
