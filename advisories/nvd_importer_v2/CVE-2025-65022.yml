aliases: []
summary: i-Educar is free, fully online school management software. In versions 2.10.0 and prior,
  an authenticated time-based SQL injection vulnerability exists in the ieducar/intranet/agenda.php
  script. An attacker with access to an authenticated session can execute arbitrary SQL commands
  against the application's database. This vulnerability is caused by the improper handling
  of the cod_agenda request parameter, which is directly concatenated into multiple SQL queries
  without proper sanitization. This issue has been patched in commit b473f92.
