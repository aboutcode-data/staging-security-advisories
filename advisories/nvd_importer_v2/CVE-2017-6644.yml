summary: 'A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Remote Expert Manager Software 11.0.0
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected
  system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently protect
  sensitive data when responding to HTTP requests that are sent to the web interface of the
  software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to
  the web interface of the software on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to access sensitive information about the software. The attacker could use this
  information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc52860.'
