summary: GHOSTS is an open source user simulation framework for cyber experimentation, simulation,
  training, and exercise. A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in GHOSTS version 8.0.0.0
  that allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory through the photo
  retrieval endpoint. The vulnerability exists in the /api/npcs/{id}/photo endpoint, which is
  designed to serve profile photos for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) but fails to properly validate
  and sanitize file paths. When an NPC is created with a specially crafted photoLink value containing
  path traversal sequences (../, ..\, etc.), the application processes these sequences without
  proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to traverse directory structures and access files
  outside of the intended photo directory, potentially exposing sensitive system files. The
  vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows reading arbitrary files from the server's
  filesystem with the permissions of the web application process, which could include configuration
  files, credentials, or other sensitive data. This issue has been addressed in version 8.2.7.90
  and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
