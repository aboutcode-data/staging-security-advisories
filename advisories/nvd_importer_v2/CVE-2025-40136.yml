summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: hisilicon/qm - request reserved interrupt for virtual function

  The device interrupt vector 3 is an error interrupt for
  physical function and a reserved interrupt for virtual function.
  However, the driver has not registered the reserved interrupt for
  virtual function. When allocating interrupts, the number of interrupts
  is allocated based on powers of two, which includes this interrupt.
  When the system enables GICv4 and the virtual function passthrough
  to the virtual machine, releasing the interrupt in the driver
  triggers a warning.

  The WARNING report is:
  WARNING: CPU: 62 PID: 14889 at arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-its.c:852 its_free_ite+0x94/0xb4

  Therefore, register a reserved interrupt for VF and set the
  IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag to avoid that warning.
