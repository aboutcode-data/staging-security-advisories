aliases: []
summary: A file upload vulnerability was discovered in CS Cart 4.18.3, allows attackers to execute
  arbitrary code. CS Cart 4.18.3 allows unrestricted upload of HTML files, which are rendered
  directly in the browser when accessed. This allows an attacker to upload a crafted HTML file
  containing malicious content, such as a fake login form for credential harvesting or scripts
  for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Since the content is served from a trusted domain,
  it significantly increases the likelihood of successful phishing or script execution against
  other users.
