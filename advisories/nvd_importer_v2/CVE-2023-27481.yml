aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. In
  versions prior to 9.16.0 users with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users`
  can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined
  with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes. Accounts
  cannot be taken over unless the hashes can be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware.
  This problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against
  with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version 9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
  Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access
  to the `password` field in `directus_users`.
