aliases: []
summary: 'An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed where determining
  if a macro was signed by a trusted author was done by only matching the serial number and
  issuer string of the used certificate with that of a trusted certificate. This is not sufficient
  to verify that the macro was actually signed with the certificate. An adversary could therefore
  create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a trusted
  certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially
  leading to the user to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. This
  issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions
  prior to 7.3.1.'
