aliases: []
summary: The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all
  versions up to, and including, 4.8.11 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'file'
  parameter of the 'raven_download_file' function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject
  a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software,
  which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP
  chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme
  installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary
  files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability
  may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the
  file download action, and the ability to upload files is also present. Otherwise, this would
  be considered exploitable by Contributor-level users and above, because they could create
  the form needed to successfully exploit this.
