summary: 'An issue was discovered in ReadyTalk Avian 1.2.0. The vm::arrayCopy method defined
  in classpath-common.h returns silently when a negative length is provided (instead of throwing
  an exception). This could result in data being lost during the copy, with varying consequences
  depending on the subsequent use of the destination buffer. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects
  products that are no longer supported by the maintainer'
