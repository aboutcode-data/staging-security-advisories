aliases: []
summary: The Event Banner WordPress plugin through 1.3 does not verify the uploaded image file,
  allowing admin accounts to upload arbitrary files, such as .exe, .php, or others executable,
  leading to RCE. Due to the lack of CSRF check, the issue can also be used via such vector
  to achieve the same result, or via a LFI as authorisation checks are missing (but would require
  WP to be loaded)
