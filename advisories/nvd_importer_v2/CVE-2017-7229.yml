aliases: []
summary: 'PGP/MIME encrypted messages injected into a Vaultive O365 (before 4.5.21) frontend
  via IMAP or SMTP have their Content-Type changed from ''Content-Type: multipart/encrypted;
  protocol="application/pgp-encrypted"; boundary="abc123abc123"'' to ''Content-Type: text/plain''
  - this results in the encrypted message being structured in such a way that most PGP/MIME-capable
  mail user agents are unable to decrypt it cleanly. The outcome is that encrypted mail passing
  through this device does not work (Denial of Service), and a common real-world consequence
  is a request to resend the mail in the clear (Information Disclosure).'
