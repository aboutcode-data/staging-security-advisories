aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the gradio-app/gradio repository, version git 67e4044, allows for
  path traversal on Windows OS. The implementation of the blocked_path functionality, which
  is intended to disallow users from reading certain files, is flawed. Specifically, while the
  application correctly blocks access to paths like 'C:/tmp/secret.txt', it fails to block access
  when using NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) syntax, such as 'C:/tmp/secret.txt::$DATA'. This
  flaw can lead to unauthorized reading of blocked file paths.
