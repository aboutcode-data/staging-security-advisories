aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in QEMU in the uefi-vars virtual device. When the guest writes to
  register UEFI_VARS_REG_BUFFER_SIZE, the .write callback `uefi_vars_write` is invoked. The
  function allocates a heap buffer without zeroing the memory, leaving the buffer filled with
  residual data from prior allocations. When the guest later reads from register UEFI_VARS_REG_PIO_BUFFER_TRANSFER,
  the .read callback `uefi_vars_read` returns leftover metadata or other sensitive process memory
  from the previously allocated buffer, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.
