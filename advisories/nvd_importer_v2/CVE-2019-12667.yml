aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the
  web interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation
  of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected software. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the web interface to access a malicious
  link or by intercepting a user request for the affected web interface and injecting malicious
  code into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive
  browser-based information.
