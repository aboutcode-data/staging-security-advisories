aliases: []
summary: SAIL is a cross-platform library for loading and saving images with support for animation,
  metadata, and ICC profiles. All versions are vulnerable to Heap-based Buffer Overflow through
  the XWD parser's use of the bytes_per_line value. The value os read directly from the file
  as the read size in io->strict_read(), and is never compared to the actual size of the destination
  buffer. An attacker can provide an XWD file with an arbitrarily large bytes_per_line, causing
  a massive write operation beyond the buffer heap allocated for the image pixels. The issue
  did not have a fix at the time of publication.
