summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/memmap: cast nr_pages to size_t before shifting

  If the allocated size exceeds UINT_MAX, then it's necessary to cast
  the mr->nr_pages value to size_t to prevent it from overflowing. In
  practice this isn't much of a concern as the required memory size will
  have been validated upfront, and accounted to the user. And > 4GB sizes
  will be necessary to make the lack of a cast a problem, which greatly
  exceeds normal user locked_vm settings that are generally in the kb to
  mb range. However, if root is used, then accounting isn't done, and
  then it's possible to hit this issue.
