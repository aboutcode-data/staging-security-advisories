  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/mm: Fix SMP ordering in switch_mm_irqs_off()

  Stephen noted that it is possible to not have an smp_mb() between
  the loaded_mm store and the tlb_gen load in switch_mm(), meaning the
  ordering against flush_tlb_mm_range() goes out the window, and it
  becomes possible for switch_mm() to not observe a recent tlb_gen
  update and fail to flush the TLBs.
