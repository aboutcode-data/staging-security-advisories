aliases: []
summary: Multiple D-Link DSL/DIR/DNS devices contain an authentication bypass and improper access
  control vulnerability in the dnscfg.cgi endpoint that allows an unauthenticated attacker to
  access DNS configuration functionality. By directly requesting this endpoint, an attacker
  can modify the device’s DNS settings without valid credentials, enabling DNS hijacking (“DNSChanger”)
  attacks that redirect user traffic to attacker-controlled infrastructure. In 2019, D-Link
  reported that this behavior was leveraged by the "GhostDNS" malware ecosystem targeting consumer
  and carrier routers. All impacted products were subsequently designated end-of-life/end-of-service,
  and no longer receive security updates. Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver
  Foundation on 2025-11-27 (UTC).
