aliases: []
summary: A sandbox escape vulnerability was identified in huggingface/smolagents version 1.14.0,
  allowing attackers to bypass the restricted execution environment and achieve remote code
  execution (RCE). The vulnerability stems from the local_python_executor.py module, which inadequately
  restricts Python code execution despite employing static and dynamic checks. Attackers can
  exploit whitelisted modules and functions to execute arbitrary code, compromising the host
  system. This flaw undermines the core security boundary intended to isolate untrusted code,
  posing risks such as unauthorized code execution, data leakage, and potential integration-level
  compromise. The issue is resolved in version 1.17.0.
