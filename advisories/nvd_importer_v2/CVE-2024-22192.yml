aliases: []
summary: Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The revocation scheme that
  is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy
  guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model. Notably, a malicious verifier
  may be able to generate a unique identifier for a holder providing a verifiable presentation
  that includes a Non-Revocation proof. The impact of the flaw is that a malicious verifier
  may be able to determine a unique identifier for a holder presenting a Non-Revocation proof.
  Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.
