summary: The Cinza Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the 'cgrid_skin_content' post meta field in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
