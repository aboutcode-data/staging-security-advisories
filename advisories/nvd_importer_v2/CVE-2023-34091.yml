aliases: []
summary: Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. In versions of Kyverno prior to
  1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can bypass validate, generate,
  or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is set
  to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion were being consciously exempted
  by Kyverno, as a way to reduce processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects
  which are being deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user
  to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes
  API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as
  a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not applicable to Kubernetes
  Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite
  finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround.
