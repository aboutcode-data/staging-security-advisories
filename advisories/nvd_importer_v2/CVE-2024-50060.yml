summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush

  In terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty.
  And if an application does overflow a bit, it'll have a few entries.
  However, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case
  that generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them can
  take quite a while.

  Check for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks and
  do so if necessary. There's no state to maintain here as overflows
  always prune from head-of-list, hence it's fine to drop and reacquire
  the locks at the end of the loop.
