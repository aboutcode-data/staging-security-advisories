aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Umbrella Enterprise Roaming Client (ERC) could allow an
  authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator. To exploit the vulnerability,
  the attacker must authenticate with valid local user credentials. This vulnerability is due
  to improper implementation of file system permissions, which could allow non-administrative
  users to place files within restricted directories. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by placing an executable file within the restricted directory, which when executed by the
  ERC client, would run with Administrator privileges.
