summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md: init bioset in mddev_init

  IO operations may be needed before md_run(), such as updating metadata
  after writing sysfs. Without bioset, this triggers a NULL pointer
  dereference as below:

   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020
   Call Trace:
    md_update_sb+0x658/0xe00
    new_level_store+0xc5/0x120
    md_attr_store+0xc9/0x1e0

    do_syscall_64+0xa9/0x580
    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

  Reproducer
  ```
    mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l1 -n2 /dev/sd[cd]
    echo inactive > /sys/block/md0/md/array_state
    echo 10 > /sys/block/md0/md/new_level
  ```

  mddev_init() can only be called once per mddev, no need to test if bioset
  has been initialized anymore.
