aliases: []
summary: StreamVault is a video download integration solution. Prior to version 251126, a Remote
  Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the stream-vault application (SpiritApplication).
  The application allows administrators to configure yt-dlp arguments via the /admin/api/saveConfig
  endpoint without sufficient validation. These arguments are stored globally and subsequently
  used in YtDlpUtil.java when constructing the command line to execute yt-dlp. This issue has
  been patched in version 251126.
