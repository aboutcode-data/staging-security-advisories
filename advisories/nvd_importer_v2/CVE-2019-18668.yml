aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the Currency Switcher addon before 2.11.2 for WooCommerce
  if a user provides a currency that was not added by the administrator. In this case, even
  though the currency does not exist, it will be selected, but a price amount will fall back
  to the default currency. This means that if an attacker provides a currency that does not
  exist and is worth less than this default, the attacker can eventually purchase an item for
  a significantly cheaper price.
