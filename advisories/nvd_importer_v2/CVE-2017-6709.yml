summary: 'A vulnerability in the AutoVNF tool for the Cisco Ultra Services Framework could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access administrative credentials for Cisco Elastic
  Services Controller (ESC) and Cisco OpenStack deployments in an affected system. The vulnerability
  exists because the affected software logs administrative credentials in clear text for Cisco
  ESC and Cisco OpenStack deployment purposes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by accessing the AutoVNF URL for the location where the log files are stored and subsequently
  accessing the administrative credentials that are stored in clear text in those log files.
  This vulnerability affects all releases of the Cisco Ultra Services Framework prior to Releases
  5.0.3 and 5.1. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc76659.'
