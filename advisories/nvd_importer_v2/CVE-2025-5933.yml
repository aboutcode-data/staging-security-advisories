summary: The RD Contacto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
