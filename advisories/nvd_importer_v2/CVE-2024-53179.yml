  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key

  Customers have reported use-after-free in @ses->auth_key.response with
  SMB2.1 + sign mounts which occurs due to following race:

  task A                         task B
  cifs_mount()
   dfs_mount_share()
    get_session()
     cifs_mount_get_session()    cifs_send_recv()
      cifs_get_smb_ses()          compound_send_recv()
       cifs_setup_session()        smb2_setup_request()
        kfree_sensitive()           smb2_calc_signature()
                                     crypto_shash_setkey() *UAF*

  Fix this by ensuring that we have a valid @ses->auth_key.response by
  checking whether @ses->ses_status is SES_GOOD or SES_EXITING with
  @ses->ses_lock held.  After commit 24a9799aa8ef ("smb: client: fix UAF
  in smb2_reconnect_server()"), we made sure to call ->logoff() only
  when @ses was known to be good (e.g. valid ->auth_key.response), so
  it's safe to access signing key when @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING.
