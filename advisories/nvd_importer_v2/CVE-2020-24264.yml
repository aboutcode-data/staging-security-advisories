aliases: []
summary: Portainer 1.24.1 and earlier is affected by incorrect access control that may lead
  to remote arbitrary code execution. The restriction checks for bind mounts are applied only
  on the client-side and not the server-side, which can lead to spawning a container with bind
  mount. Once such a container is spawned, it can be leveraged to break out of the container
  leading to complete Docker host machine takeover.
