summary: The Access Control issues include allowing a regular user to view a restricted incident,
  user role escalation to admin, users adding themselves as a participant in a restricted incident,
  and users able to view restricted incidents via the search feature. If your install has followed
  the secure deployment guidelines the risk of this is lowered, as this may only be exploited
  by an authenticated user.
