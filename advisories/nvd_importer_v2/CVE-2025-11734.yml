aliases: []
summary: The Broken Link Checker by AIOSEO – Easily Fix/Monitor Internal and External links
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post modification due to missing authorization
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This is due to the plugin registering a REST
  API endpoint that only checks for a broad capability (aioseo_blc_broken_links_page) that is
  granted to contributor level users, without verifying the user's permission to perform actions
  on the specific post being targeted. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  contributor level access and above, to trash arbitrary posts via the DELETE /wp-json/aioseoBrokenLinkChecker/v1/post
  endpoint.
