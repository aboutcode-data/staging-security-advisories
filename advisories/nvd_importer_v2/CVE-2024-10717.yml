aliases: []
summary: 'The Styler for Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification
  of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the deactivate_license
  function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary option values on the
  WordPress site. This can be leveraged to delete an option that would create an error on the
  site and deny service to legitimate users. Note: This issue can also be used to add arbitrary
  options with an empty value.'
