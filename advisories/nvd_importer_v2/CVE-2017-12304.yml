summary: 'A vulnerability in the IOS daemon (IOSd) web-based management interface of Cisco IOS
  and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface on an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the
  web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading
  a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to execute arbitrary script code in the web-based management interface or allow the attacker
  to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf60862.'
