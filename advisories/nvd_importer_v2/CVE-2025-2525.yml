aliases: []
summary: The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing
  file type validation in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
  and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
  remote code execution possible.
