aliases: []
summary: This issue exists to document that a security improvement in the way that Jira Server
  and Data Center use velocity templates has been implemented. The way in which velocity templates
  were used in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center in affected versions allowed remote attackers
  to achieve remote code execution via insecure deserialization, if they were able to exploit
  a server side template injection vulnerability. The affected versions are before version 7.13.0,
  from version 8.0.0 before 8.5.0, and from version 8.6.0 before version 8.8.1.
