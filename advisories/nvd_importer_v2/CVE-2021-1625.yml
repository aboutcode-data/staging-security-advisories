aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Zone-Based Policy Firewall feature of Cisco IOS XE Software
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent the Zone-Based Policy Firewall
  from correctly classifying traffic. This vulnerability exists because ICMP and UDP responder-to-initiator
  flows are not inspected when the Zone-Based Policy Firewall has either Unified Threat Defense
  (UTD) or Application Quality of Experience (AppQoE) configured. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by attempting to send UDP or ICMP flows through the network. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to inject traffic through the Zone-Based Policy Firewall,
  resulting in traffic being dropped because it is incorrectly classified or in incorrect reporting
  figures being produced by high-speed logging (HSL).
