  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: mcba_usb: mcba_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak

  Fix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb:
  gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").

  In mcba_usb_probe() -> mcba_usb_start(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are
  allocated, added to the priv->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the
  complete callback mcba_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and
  resubmitted. In mcba_usb_close() -> mcba_urb_unlink() the URBs are freed by
  calling usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&priv->rx_submitted).

  However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
  the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
  in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
  released in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

  Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the
  mcba_usb_read_bulk_callback()to the priv->rx_submitted anchor.
