aliases: []
summary: The Image Hotspot by DevVN plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 via deserialization of untrusted input in the
  'devvn_ihotspot_shortcode_func' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
  in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
  on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
  data, or execute code.
