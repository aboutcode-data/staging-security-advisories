  nfsd: fix handling of cached open files in nfsd4_open codepath

  Commit fb70bf124b05 ("NFSD: Instantiate a struct file when creating a
  regular NFSv4 file") added the ability to cache an open fd over a
  compound. There are a couple of problems with the way this currently
  works:

  It's racy, as a newly-created nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bit
  cleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file pointer is still zeroed
  out. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see a
  valid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.

  Also, there is no guarantee that we'll end up creating a new nfsd_file
  if one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the hash with a
  valid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer with
  the value of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.

  Fix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened variant that
  takes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called,
  we'll take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. If
  the nfsd_file already has a valid nf_file, we'll just ignore the
  optional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.

  Also rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an "opened" variant and
  don't try to avoid counting acquisitions in the case where we already
  have a cached open file.
