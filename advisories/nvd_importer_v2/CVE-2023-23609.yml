aliases: []
summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation
  IoT devices. Versions prior to and including 4.8 are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write
  that can occur in the BLE-L2CAP module. The Bluetooth Low Energy - Logical Link Control and
  Adaptation Layer Protocol (BLE-L2CAP) module handles fragmentation of packets up the configured
  MTU size. When fragments are reassembled, they are stored in a packet buffer of a configurable
  size, but there is no check to verify that the packet buffer is large enough to hold the reassembled
  packet. In Contiki-NG''s default configuration, it is possible that an out-of-bounds write
  of up to 1152 bytes occurs. The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of
  Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be fixed by applying the
  patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2254 prior to the release of version 4.9.'
