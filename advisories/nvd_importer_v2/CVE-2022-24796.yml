aliases: []
summary: RaspberryMatic is a free and open-source operating system for running a cloud-free
  smart-home using the homematicIP / HomeMatic hardware line of IoT devices. A Remote Code Execution
  (RCE) vulnerability in the file upload facility of the WebUI interface of RaspberryMatic exists.
  Missing input validation/sanitization in the file upload mechanism allows remote, unauthenticated
  attackers with network access to the WebUI interface to achieve arbitrary operating system
  command execution via shell metacharacters in the HTTP query string. Injected commands are
  executed as root, thus leading to a full compromise of the underlying system and all its components.
  Versions after `2.31.25.20180428` and prior to `3.63.8.20220330` are affected. Users are advised
  to update to version `3.63.8.20220330` or newer. There are currently no known workarounds
  to mitigate the security impact and users are advised to update to the latest version available.
