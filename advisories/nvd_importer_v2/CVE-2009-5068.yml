aliases: []
summary: There is a file disclosure vulnerability in SMF (Simple Machines Forum) affecting versions
  through v2.0.3. On some configurations a SMF deployment is shared by several "co-admins" that
  are not trusted beyond the SMF deployment. This vulnerability allows them to read arbitrary
  files on the filesystem and therefore gain new privileges by reading the settings.php with
  the database passwords.
