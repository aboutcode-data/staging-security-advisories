summary: The 4stats plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the stats/stats.php page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
