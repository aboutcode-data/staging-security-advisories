  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  start_kernel: Add __no_stack_protector function attribute

  Back during the discussion of
  commit a9a3ed1eff36 ("x86: Fix early boot crash on gcc-10, third try")
  we discussed the need for a function attribute to control the omission
  of stack protectors on a per-function basis; at the time Clang had
  support for no_stack_protector but GCC did not. This was fixed in
  gcc-11. Now that the function attribute is available, let's start using
  it.

  Callers of boot_init_stack_canary need to use this function attribute
  unless they're compiled with -fno-stack-protector, otherwise the canary
  stored in the stack slot of the caller will differ upon the call to
  boot_init_stack_canary. This will lead to a call to __stack_chk_fail()
  then panic.
