summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. A vulnerability in version 8.0 is
  similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use invitations, not single-use invitation
  links as in the prior CVE. Specifically, it applies when the installation has configured non-admins
  to be able to invite users and create multi-use invitations, and has also configured only
  admins to be able to invite users to streams. As in CVE-2023-32677, this does not let users
  invite new users to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviter can already see. Version
  8.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround, administrators can limit sending of invitations down
  to users who also have the permission to add users to streams.
