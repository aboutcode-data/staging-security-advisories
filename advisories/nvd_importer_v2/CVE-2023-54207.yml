summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: uclogic: Correct devm device reference for hidinput input_dev name

  Reference the HID device rather than the input device for the devm
  allocation of the input_dev name. Referencing the input_dev would lead to a
  use-after-free when the input_dev was unregistered and subsequently fires a
  uevent that depends on the name. At the point of firing the uevent, the
  name would be freed by devres management.

  Use devm_kasprintf to simplify the logic for allocating memory and
  formatting the input_dev name string.
