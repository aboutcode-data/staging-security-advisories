aliases: []
summary: The evm crate is a pure Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. In `evm` crate
  `< 0.31.0`, `JUMPI` opcode's condition is checked after the destination validity check. However,
  according to Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should happen before the destination
  validity check. This is a **high** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate for Ethereum
  mainnet. In this case, you should update your library dependency immediately to on or after
  `0.31.0`. This is a **low** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate in Frontier
  or in a standalone blockchain, because there's no security exploit possible with this advisory.
  It is **not** recommended to update to on or after `0.31.0` until all the normal chain upgrade
  preparations have been done. If you use Frontier or other `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchain,
  please ensure to update your `spec_version` before updating this. For other blockchains, please
  make sure to follow a hard-fork process before you update this.
