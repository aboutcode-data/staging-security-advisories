aliases: []
summary: CakePHP is a development framework for PHP web apps. In affected versions the `Cake\Database\Query::limit()`
  and `Cake\Database\Query::offset()` methods are vulnerable to SQL injection if passed un-sanitized
  user request data. This issue has been fixed in 4.2.12, 4.3.11, 4.4.10. Users are advised
  to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by using CakePHP's Pagination
  library. Manually validating or casting parameters to these methods will also mitigate the
  issue.
