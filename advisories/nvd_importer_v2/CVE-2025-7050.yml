summary: The Use-your-Drive | Google Drive plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'title' parameter in file metadata in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This
  makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
