aliases: []
summary: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.
  Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, Envoy does not sanitize or escape
  request properties when generating request headers. This can lead to characters that are illegal
  in header values to be sent to the upstream service. In the worst case, it can cause upstream
  service to interpret the original request as two pipelined requests, possibly bypassing the
  intent of Envoy’s security policy. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9 contain
  a patch. As a workaround, disable adding request headers based on the downstream request properties,
  such as downstream certificate properties.
