aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. Versions of envoy prior to 1.22.1 are
  subject to a segmentation fault in the GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. Envoy can perform various types
  of upstream health checking. One of them uses gRPC. Envoy also has a feature which can “hold”
  (prevent removal) upstream hosts obtained via service discovery until configured active health
  checking fails. If an attacker controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery
  of that host (via DNS, the EDS API, etc.), an attacker can crash Envoy by forcing removal
  of the host from service discovery, and then failing the gRPC health check request. This will
  crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this vulnerability.
  Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health checking and/or replace it with a different
  health checking type as a mitigation.
