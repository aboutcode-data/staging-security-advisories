aliases: []
summary: 'The pswd.js script relies on the client to calculate whether a username and password
  match hard-coded hashed values for a server, and uses a hashing scheme that creates a large
  number of collisions, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct offline brute
  force attacks.  NOTE: this script might also allow attackers to generate the server-side "secret"
  URL without determining the original password, but this possibility was not discussed by the
  original researcher.'
