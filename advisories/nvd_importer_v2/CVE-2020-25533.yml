aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Malwarebytes before 4.0 on macOS. A malicious application
  was able to perform a privileged action within the Malwarebytes launch daemon. The privileged
  service improperly validated XPC connections by relying on the PID instead of the audit token.
  An attacker can construct a situation where the same PID is used for running two different
  programs at different times, by leveraging a race condition during crafted use of posix_spawn.
