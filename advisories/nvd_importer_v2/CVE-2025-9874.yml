aliases: []
summary: The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.6 via the 'uclwp_dashboard' shortcode. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include
  and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in
  those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.
