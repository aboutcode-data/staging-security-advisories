aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2.0.1. There is a heap-based buffer overflow in
  mkAddToRelayCacheRequest and in ccnl_populate_cache for an array lacking '\0' termination
  when reading a binary CCNx or NDN file. This can result in Heap Corruption. This was addressed
  by fixing the memory management in mkAddToRelayCacheRequest in ccn-lite-ctrl.c.
