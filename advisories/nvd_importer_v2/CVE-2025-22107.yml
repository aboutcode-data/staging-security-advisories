  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()

  There are actually 2 problems:
  - deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements
    [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.
  - The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last
    element is out of bounds.

  The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being
  accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes
  in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds
  element is part of an unmapped page.
