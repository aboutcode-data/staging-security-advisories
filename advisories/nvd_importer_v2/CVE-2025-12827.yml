aliases: []
summary: The Top Friends plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 0.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the top_friends_options_subpanel()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via
  a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
