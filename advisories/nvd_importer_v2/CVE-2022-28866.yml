aliases: []
summary: Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18
  Firmware v4.13.00. It does not properly validate requests for access to (or editing of) data
  and functionality in all endpoints under /#settings/* and /api/settings/*. By not verifying
  the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages, with
  sensitive data, that are not allowed, and modify system configurations also causing DoS, which
  should be accessed only by user with administration profile, bypassing all controls (without
  checking for user identity).
