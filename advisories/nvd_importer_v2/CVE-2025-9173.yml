summary: 'Rejected reason: ** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none.
  Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was
  not a security issue. Notes: The file upload in include/service/media.php verifies the file
  extension based on a list defined in include/lib/option.php. This whitelist prevents unrestricted
  uploads (e.g. PHP files). Therefore, the attack possibility is just of theoretical nature.'
