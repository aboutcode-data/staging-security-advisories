aliases: []
summary: mchange-commons-java, a library that provides Java utilities, includes code that mirrors
  early implementations of JNDI functionality, including support for remote `factoryClassLocation`
  values, by which code can be downloaded and invoked within a running application. If an attacker
  can provoke an application to read a maliciously crafted `jaxax.naming.Reference` or serialized
  object, they can provoke the download and execution of malicious code. Implementations of
  this functionality within the JDK were disabled by default behind a System property that defaults
  to `false`, `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase`. However, since mchange-commons-java
  includes an independent implementation of JNDI derefencing, libraries (such as c3p0) that
  resolve references via that implementation could be provoked to download and execute malicious
  code even after the JDK was hardened. Mirroring the JDK patch, mchange-commons-java's JNDI
  functionality is gated by configuration parameters that default to restrictive values starting
  in version 0.4.0. No known workarounds are available. Versions prior to 0.4.0 should be avoided
  on application CLASSPATHs.
