aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions
  0.3.10 and prior, using the `sqrt` builtin can result in double eval vulnerability when the
  argument has side-effects. It can be seen that the `build_IR` function of the `sqrt` builtin
  doesn't cache the argument to the stack. As such, it can be evaluated multiple times (instead
  of retrieving the value from the stack). No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally,
  double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such,
  the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.
