summary: The Where I Was, Where I Will Be plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File
  Inclusion in version <= 1.1.1 via the WIW_HEADER parameter of the /system/include/include_user.php
  file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary
  files hosted on external servers, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This
  can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution. This
  requires allow_url_include to be set to true in order to exploit, which is not commonly enabled.
