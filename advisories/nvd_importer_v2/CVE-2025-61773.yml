aliases: []
summary: pyLoad is a free and open-source download manager written in Python. In versions prior
  to 0.5.0b3.dev91, pyLoad web interface contained insufficient input validation in both the
  Captcha script endpoint and the Click'N'Load (CNL) Blueprint. This flaw allowed untrusted
  user input to be processed unsafely, which could be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary
  content into the web UI or manipulate request handling. The vulnerability could lead to client-side
  code execution (XSS) or other unintended behaviors when a malicious payload is submitted.
  user-supplied parameters from HTTP requests were not adequately validated or sanitized before
  being passed into the application logic and response generation. This allowed crafted input
  to alter the expected execution flow. CNL (Click'N'Load) blueprint exposed unsafe handling
  of untrusted parameters in HTTP requests. The application did not consistently enforce input
  validation or encoding, making it possible for an attacker to craft malicious requests. Version
  0.5.0b3.dev91 contains a patch for the issue.
