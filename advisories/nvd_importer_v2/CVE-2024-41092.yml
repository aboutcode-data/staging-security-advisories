  drm/i915/gt: Fix potential UAF by revoke of fence registers

  CI has been sporadically reporting the following issue triggered by
  igt@i915_selftest@live@hangcheck on ADL-P and similar machines:

  In the past, there were similar failures reported by CI from other IGT
  tests, observed on other platforms.

  Before commit 63baf4f3d587 ("drm/i915/gt: Only wait for GPU activity
  before unbinding a GGTT fence"), i915_vma_revoke_fence() was waiting for
  idleness of vma->active via fence_update().   That commit introduced
  vma->fence->active in order for the fence_update() to be able to wait
  selectively on that one instead of vma->active since only idleness of
  fence registers was needed.  But then, another commit 0d86ee35097a
  ("drm/i915/gt: Make fence revocation unequivocal") replaced the call to
  fence_update() in i915_vma_revoke_fence() with only fence_write(), and
  also added that GEM_BUG_ON(!i915_active_is_idle(&fence->active)) in front.
  No justification was provided on why we might then expect idleness of
  vma->fence->active without first waiting on it.

  The issue can be potentially caused by a race among revocation of fence
  registers on one side and sequential execution of signal callbacks invoked
  on completion of a request that was using them on the other, still
  processed in parallel to revocation of those fence registers.  Fix it by
  waiting for idleness of vma->fence->active in i915_vma_revoke_fence().
