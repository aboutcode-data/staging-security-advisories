aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data

  The URB received in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() contains a struct
  gs_host_frame. The length of the data after the header depends on the
  gs_host_frame hf::flags and the active device features (e.g. time
  stamping).

  Introduce a new function gs_usb_get_minimum_length() and check that we have
  at least received the required amount of data before accessing it. Only
  copy the data to that skb that has actually been received.

  [mkl: rename gs_usb_get_minimum_length() -> +gs_usb_get_minimum_rx_length()]
