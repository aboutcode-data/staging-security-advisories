aliases: []
summary: An OpenSSH daemon listens on TCP port 22. There is a hard-coded entry in the "/etc/shadow"
  file in the firmware image for the "root" user. However, in the default SSH configuration
  the "PermitRootLogin" is disabled, preventing the root user from logging in via SSH. This
  configuration can be bypassed/changed by an attacker through multiple paths though.
