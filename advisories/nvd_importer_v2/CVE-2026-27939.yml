summary: Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Starting in
  version 6.0.0 and prior to version 6.4.0, Authenticated Control Panel users may under certain

  can allow access to sensitive operations and, depending on the user’s existing permissions,
  may lead to privilege escalation. This has been fixed in 6.4.0.
