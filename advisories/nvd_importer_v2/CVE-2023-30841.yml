summary: Baremetal Operator (BMO) is a bare metal host provisioning integration for Kubernetes.
  Prior to version 0.3.0, ironic and ironic-inspector deployed within Baremetal Operator using
  the included `deploy.sh` store their `.htpasswd` files as ConfigMaps instead of Secrets. This
  causes the plain-text username and hashed password to be readable by anyone having a cluster-wide
  read-access to the management cluster, or access to the management cluster's Etcd storage.
  This issue is patched in baremetal-operator PR#1241, and is included in BMO release 0.3.0
  onwards. As a workaround, users may modify the kustomizations and redeploy the BMO, or recreate
  the required ConfigMaps as Secrets per instructions in baremetal-operator PR#1241.
