aliases: []
summary: 'WampServer 3.0.6 has two files called ''wampmanager.exe'' and ''unins000.exe'' with
  a weak ACL for Modify. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
  user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. To properly exploit
  this vulnerability, the local attacker must insert an executable file called wampmanager.exe
  or unins000.exe and replace the original files. The next time one of these programs is launched
  by a more privileged user, malicious code chosen by the local attacker will run. NOTE: the
  vendor disputes the relevance of this report, taking the position that a configuration in
  which "''someone'' (an attacker) is able to replace files on a PC" is not "the fault of WampServer.'
