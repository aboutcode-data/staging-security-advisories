summary: iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools for working with ICC color management
  profiles. In versions up to and including 2.3.1.4, heap-buffer-overflow read occurs during
  CIccTagTextDescription::Release() when strlen() reads past a heap buffer while parsing ICC
  profile XML text description tags, causing a crash. Commit 29d088840b962a7cdd35993dfabc2cb35a049847
  fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.
