aliases: []
summary: 'In Archer Platform 6 through 6.14.00202.10024, an authenticated user with record creation
  privileges can manipulate immutable fields, such as the creation date, by intercepting and
  modifying a Copy request via a GenericContent/Record.aspx?id= URI. NOTE: the Supplier analyzed
  the reported exploitation steps and found that, although the user can modify the immutable
  field, upon switching to View mode the field is reverted to its original value, without anything
  being saved to the database (and consequently there is no impact).'
