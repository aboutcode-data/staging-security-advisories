aliases: []
summary: Each Apache Dubbo server will set a serialization id to tell the clients which serialization
  protocol it is working on. But for Dubbo versions before 2.7.8 or 2.6.9, an attacker can choose
  which serialization id the Provider will use by tampering with the byte preamble flags, aka,
  not following the server's instruction. This means that if a weak deserializer such as the
  Kryo and FST are somehow in code scope (e.g. if Kryo is somehow a part of a dependency), a
  remote unauthenticated attacker can tell the Provider to use the weak deserializer, and then
  proceed to exploit it.
