aliases: []
summary: The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin before 2.73.13 allows a high privileged user
  to bypass the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MODS settings and upload arbitrary files
  to the site through the "ajax_save" function. The file is written relative to the current
  's stylesheet directory, and a .php file extension is added. No validation is performed on
  the content of the file, triggering an RCE vulnerability by uploading a web shell. Further
  the name parameter is not sanitized, allowing the payload to be uploaded to any directory
  to which the server has write access.
