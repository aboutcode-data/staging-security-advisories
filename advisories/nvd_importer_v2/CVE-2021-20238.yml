aliases: []
summary: It was found in OpenShift Container Platform 4 that ignition config, served by the
  Machine Config Server, can be accessed externally from clusters without authentication. The
  MCS endpoint (port 22623) provides ignition configuration used for bootstrapping Nodes and
  can include some sensitive data, e.g. registry pull secrets. There are two scenarios where
  this data can be accessed. The first is on Baremetal, OpenStack, Ovirt, Vsphere and KubeVirt
  deployments which do not have a separate internal API endpoint and allow access from outside
  the cluster to port 22623 from the standard OpenShift API Virtual IP address. The second is
  on cloud deployments when using unsupported network plugins, which do not create iptables
  rules that prevent to port 22623. In this scenario, the ignition config is exposed to all
  pods within the cluster and cannot be accessed externally.
