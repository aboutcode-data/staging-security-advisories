aliases: []
summary: A flaw was discovered in OpenShift Container Platform 4 where, by default, users with
  access to create pods also have the ability to schedule workloads on master nodes. Pods with
  permission to access the host network, running on master nodes, can retrieve security credentials
  for the master AWS IAM role, allowing management access to AWS resources. With access to the
  security credentials, the user then has access to the entire infrastructure. Impact to data
  and system availability is high.
