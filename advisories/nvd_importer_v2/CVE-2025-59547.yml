aliases: []
summary: DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) is an open-source web content management platform (CMS) in
  the Microsoft ecosystem. Prior to version 10.1.0, the CKEditor file upload endpoint has insufficient
  sanitization for filenames allowing probing network endpoints. A specially crafted request
  can be made to upload a file with Unicode characters, which would be translated into a path
  that could expose resources in the internal network of the hosted site. This issue has been
  patched in version 10.1.0.
