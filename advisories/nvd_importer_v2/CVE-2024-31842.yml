aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Italtel Embrace 1.6.4. The web application inserts the access
  token of an authenticated user inside GET requests. The query string for the URL could be
  saved in the browser's history, passed through Referers to other web sites, stored in web
  logs, or otherwise recorded in other sources. If the query string contains sensitive information
  such as session identifiers, then attackers can use this information to launch further attacks.
  Because the access token in sent in GET requests, this vulnerability could lead to complete
  account takeover.
