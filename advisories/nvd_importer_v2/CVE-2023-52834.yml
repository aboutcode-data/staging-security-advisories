  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  atl1c: Work around the DMA RX overflow issue

  This is based on alx driver commit 881d0327db37 ("net: alx: Work around
  the DMA RX overflow issue").

  The alx and atl1c drivers had RX overflow error which was why a custom
  allocator was created to avoid certain addresses. The simpler workaround
  then created for alx driver, but not for atl1c due to lack of tester.

  Instead of using a custom allocator, check the allocated skb address and
  use skb_reserve() to move away from problematic 0x...fc0 address.

  Tested on AR8131 on Acer 4540.
