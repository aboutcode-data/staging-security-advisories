aliases: []
summary: The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.49.1
  via the 'listen_for_csv_export' function. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
  that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with access to the Forminator dashboard, to export sensitive form submission data including
  personally identifiable information.
