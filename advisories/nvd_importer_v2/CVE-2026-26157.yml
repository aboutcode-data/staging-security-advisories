aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in BusyBox. Incomplete path sanitization in its archive extraction
  utilities allows an attacker to craft malicious archives that when extracted, and under specific
  conditions, may write to files outside the intended directory. This can lead to arbitrary
  file overwrite, potentially enabling code execution through the modification of sensitive
  system files.
