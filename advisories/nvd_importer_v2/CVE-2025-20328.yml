summary: "A vulnerability in the user profile component of Cisco Webex Meetings could have allowed\
  \ an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to conduct a cross-site scripting\
  \ (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. Cisco has addressed this vulnerability\
  \ in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.\r\n\r This vulnerability\
  \ existed because of insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the user profile component\
  \ of Cisco Webex Meetings. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could\
  \ have exploited this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted\
  \ link. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to conduct an XSS attack against\
  \ the targeted user."
