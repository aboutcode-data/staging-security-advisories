summary: TOTOLINK X6000R v9.4.0cu.1498_B20250826 contains an OS command injection vulnerability
  in the NTPSyncWithHost handler of the /usr/sbin/shttpd executable. The host_time parameter
  is retrieved via sub_40C404 and passed to a date -s shell command through CsteSystem. While
  the first two tokens of the input are validated, the remainder of the string is not sanitized,
  allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands via shell metacharacters.
