aliases: []
summary: cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes
  clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.
  In versions from 1.18.0 to before 1.18.5 and from 1.19.0 to before 1.19.3, the cert-manager-controller
  performs DNS lookups during ACME DNS-01 processing (for zone discovery and propagation self-checks).
  By default, these lookups use standard unencrypted DNS. An attacker who can intercept and
  modify DNS traffic from the cert-manager-controller pod can insert a crafted entry into cert-manager's
  DNS cache. Accessing this entry will trigger a panic, resulting in denial‑of‑service (DoS)
  of the cert-manager controller. The issue can also be exploited if the authoritative DNS server
  for the domain being validated is controlled by a malicious actor. This issue has been patched
  in versions 1.18.5 and 1.19.3.
