summary: "ActiveSupport::EncryptedFile writes contents that will be encrypted to a\r\ntemporary\
  \ file.  The temporary file's permissions are defaulted to the user's\r\ncurrent `umask` settings,\
  \ meaning that it's possible for other users on the\r\nsame system to read the contents of\
  \ the temporary file.\r\n\r\nAttackers that have access to the file system could possibly\
  \ read the contents\r\nof this temporary file while a user is editing it.\r\n\r\nAll users\
  \ running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\r\nworkarounds immediately."
