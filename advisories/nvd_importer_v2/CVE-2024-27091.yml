summary: GeoNode is a geospatial content management system, a platform for the management and
  publication of geospatial data. An issue exists within GEONODE where the current rich text
  editor is vulnerable to Stored XSS. The applications cookies are set securely, but it is possible
  to retrieve a victims CSRF token and issue a request to change another user's email address
  to perform a full account takeover. Due to the script element not impacting the CORS policy,
  requests will succeed. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.2.3.
