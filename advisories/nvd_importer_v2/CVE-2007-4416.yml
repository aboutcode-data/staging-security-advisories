summary: 'captcha.php in BellaBook (aka BellaBuffs) allows remote attackers to obtain administrative
  privileges by sending the admin''s username (admin_name) in a pheap_login cookie.  NOTE: the
  vendor disputes this vulnerability because authentication data is derived from the admin_pass
  and secret variables, in addition to the admin_name; and because the exploit code is designed
  for an unrelated application'
