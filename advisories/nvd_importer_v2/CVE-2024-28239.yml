aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The
  authentication API has a `redirect` parameter that can be exploited as an open redirect vulnerability
  as the user tries to log in via the API URL. There's a redirect that is done after successful
  login via the Auth API GET request to `directus/auth/login/google?redirect=http://malicious-fishing-site.com`.
  While credentials don't seem to be passed to the attacker site, the user can be phished into
  clicking a legitimate directus site and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an
  error message "Your password needs to be updated" to phish out the current password. Users
  who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue has been addressed in version
  10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
