aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in ownCloud owncloud/graphapi 0.2.x before 0.2.1 and 0.3.x
  before 0.3.1. The graphapi app relies on a third-party GetPhpInfo.php library that provides
  a URL. When this URL is accessed, it reveals the configuration details of the PHP environment
  (phpinfo). This information includes all the environment variables of the webserver. In containerized
  deployments, these environment variables may include sensitive data such as the ownCloud admin
  password, mail server credentials, and license key. Simply disabling the graphapi app does
  not eliminate the vulnerability. Additionally, phpinfo exposes various other potentially sensitive
  configuration details that could be exploited by an attacker to gather information about the
  system. Therefore, even if ownCloud is not running in a containerized environment, this vulnerability
  should still be a cause for concern. Note that Docker containers from before February 2023
  are not vulnerable to the credential disclosure.
