aliases: []
summary: cPanel does not automatically synchronize the PHP open_basedir configuration directive
  between the main server and virtual hosts that share physical directories, which might allow
  a local user to bypass open_basedir restrictions and access other virtual hosts via a PHP
  script that uses a main server URL (such as ~username) that is blocked by the user's own open_basedir
  directive, but not the main server's open_basedir directive.
