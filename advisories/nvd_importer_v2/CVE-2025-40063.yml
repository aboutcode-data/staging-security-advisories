  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: comp - Use same definition of context alloc and free ops

  In commit 42d9f6c77479 ("crypto: acomp - Move scomp stream allocation
  code into acomp"), the crypto_acomp_streams struct was made to rely on
  having the alloc_ctx and free_ctx operations defined in the same order
  as the scomp_alg struct. But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and
  free_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized by structure layout
  randomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure
  (containing only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg
  are randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams are not, then
  the order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the
  union from scomp_alg so that both crypto_acomp_streams and scomp_alg
  will share the same definition of alloc_ctx and free_ctx, ensuring
  they will always have the same layout.
