aliases: []
summary: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (pfcpiface component)
  in version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. After PFCP association, a PFCP Session Establishment
  Request that includes a CreateFAR with an empty or truncated IPv4 address field is not properly
  validated. During parsing, parseFAR() calls ip2int(), which performs an out-of-bounds read
  on the IPv4 address buffer and triggers an index-out-of-range panic. An attacker who can send
  PFCP Session Establishment Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this
  issue to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services.
