aliases: []
summary: The IMITHEMES Listing plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.3. This is due to the plugin not properly validating
  a verification code value prior to updating their password through the imic_reset_password_init()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change any user's passwords,
  including administrators if the users email is known.
