summary: Monkshu is an enterprise application server for mobile apps (iOS and Android), responsive
  HTML 5 apps, and JSON API services. In version 2.90 and earlier, there is a reflected cross-site
  scripting vulnerability in frontend HTTP server. The attacker can send in a carefully crafted
  URL along with a known bug in the server which will cause a 500 error, and the response will
  then embed the URL provided by the hacker. The impact is moderate as the hacker must also
  be able to craft an HTTP request which should cause a 500 server error. None such requests
  are known as this point. The issue is patched in version 2.95. As a workaround, one may use
  a disk caching plugin.
