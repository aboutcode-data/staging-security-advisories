aliases: []
summary: 'libp2p-rust is the official rust language Implementation of the libp2p networking
  stack. In versions prior to 0.45.1 an attacker node can cause a victim node to allocate a
  large number of small memory chunks, which can ultimately lead to the victim’s process running
  out of memory and thus getting killed by its operating system. When executed continuously,
  this can lead to a denial of service attack, especially relevant on a larger scale when run
  against more than one node of a libp2p based network. Users are advised to upgrade to `libp2p`
  `v0.45.1` or above. Users unable to upgrade should reference the DoS Mitigation page for more
  information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor their application, and respond
  to attacks: https://docs.libp2p.io/reference/dos-mitigation/.'
