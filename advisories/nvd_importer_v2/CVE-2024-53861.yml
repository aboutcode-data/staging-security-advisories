aliases: []
summary: 'pyjwt is a JSON Web Token implementation in Python. An incorrect string comparison
  is run for `iss` checking, resulting in `"acb"` being accepted for `"_abc_"`. This is a bug
  introduced in version 2.10.0: checking the "iss" claim changed from `isinstance(issuer, list)`
  to `isinstance(issuer, Sequence)`. Since str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used
  for string comparison. This results in `if "abc" not in "__abcd__":` being checked instead
  of `if "abc" != "__abc__":`. Signature checks are still present so real world impact is likely
  limited to denial of service scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 2.10.1. All
  users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
