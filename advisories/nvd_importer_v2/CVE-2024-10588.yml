aliases: []
summary: The Debug Tool plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due
  to a missing capability check on the info() function in all versions up to, and including,
  2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and
  above, to obtain information from phpinfo(). When WP_DEBUG is enabled, this can be exploited
  by unauthenticated users as well.
