summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In version 2.32.0 of the web
  application, all users have a scope assigned, and they only have access to the files within
  that scope. The Command Execution feature of Filebrowser allows the execution of shell commands
  which are not restricted to the scope, potentially giving an attacker read and write access
  to all files managed by the server. Until this issue is fixed, the maintainers recommend to
  completely disable `Execute commands` for all accounts. Since the command execution is an
  inherently dangerous feature that is not used by all deployments, it should be possible to
  completely disable it in the application's configuration. As a defense-in-depth measure, organizations
  not requiring command execution should operate the Filebrowser from a distroless container
  image. A patch version has been pushed to disable the feature for all existent installations,
  and making it opt-in. A warning has been added to the documentation and is printed on the
  console if the feature is enabled. Due to the project being in maintenance-only mode, the
  bug has not been fixed. Fix is tracked on pull request 5199.
