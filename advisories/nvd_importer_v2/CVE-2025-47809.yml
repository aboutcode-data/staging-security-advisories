summary: Wibu CodeMeter before 8.30a sometimes allows privilege escalation immediately after
  installation (before a logoff or reboot). For exploitation, there must have been an unprivileged
  installation with UAC, and the CodeMeter Control Center component must be installed, and the
  CodeMeter Control Center component must not have been restarted. In this scenario, the local
  user can navigate from Import License to a privileged instance of Windows Explorer.
