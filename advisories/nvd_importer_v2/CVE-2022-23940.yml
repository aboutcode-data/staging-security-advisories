aliases: []
summary: SuiteCRM through 7.12.1 and 8.x through 8.0.1 allows Remote Code Execution. Authenticated
  users with access to the Scheduled Reports module can achieve this by leveraging PHP deserialization
  in the email_recipients property. By using a crafted request, they can create a malicious
  report, containing a PHP-deserialization payload in the email_recipients field. Once someone
  accesses this report, the backend will deserialize the content of the email_recipients field
  and the payload gets executed. Project dependencies include a number of interesting PHP deserialization
  gadgets (e.g., Monolog/RCE1 from phpggc) that can be used for Code Execution.
