  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usbnet: Prevents free active kevent

  The root cause of this issue are:
  1. When probing the usbnet device, executing usbnet_link_change(dev, 0, 0);
  put the kevent work in global workqueue. However, the kevent has not yet
  been scheduled when the usbnet device is unregistered. Therefore, executing
  free_netdev() results in the "free active object (kevent)" error reported
  here.

  2. Another factor is that when calling usbnet_disconnect()->unregister_netdev(),
  if the usbnet device is up, ndo_stop() is executed to cancel the kevent.
  However, because the device is not up, ndo_stop() is not executed.

  The solution to this problem is to cancel the kevent before executing
  free_netdev().
