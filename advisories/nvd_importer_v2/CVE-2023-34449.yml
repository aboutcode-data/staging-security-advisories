aliases: []
summary: ink! is an embedded domain specific language to write smart contracts in Rust for blockchains
  built on the Substrate framework. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.2.1, the
  return value when using delegate call mechanics, either through `CallBuilder::delegate` or
  `ink_env::invoke_contract_delegate`, is decoded incorrectly. This bug was related to the mechanics
  around decoding a call's return buffer, which was changed as part of pull request 1450. Since
  this feature was only released in ink! 4.0.0, no previous versions are affected. Users who
  have an ink! 4.x series contract should upgrade to 4.2.1 to receive a patch.
