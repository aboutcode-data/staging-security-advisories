aliases: []
summary: The Async JavaScript plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  in versions up to, and including,  2.19.07.14. This is due to missing authorization checks
  on the aj_steps AJAX aciton along with a lack on sanitization on the settings saved via the
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber level permissions
  and above to inject malicious web scripts into a page that execute whenever a user accesses
  that page.
