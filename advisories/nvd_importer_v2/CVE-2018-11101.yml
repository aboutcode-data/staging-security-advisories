summary: 'Open Whisper Signal (aka Signal-Desktop) through 1.10.1 allows XSS via a resource
  location specified in an attribute of a SCRIPT, IFRAME, or IMG element, leading to JavaScript
  execution after a reply, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10994. The attacker needs
  to send HTML code directly as a message, and then reply to that message to trigger this vulnerability.
  The Signal-Desktop software fails to sanitize specific HTML elements that can be used to inject
  HTML code into remote chat windows when replying to an HTML message. Specifically the IMG
  and IFRAME elements can be used to include remote or local resources. For example, the use
  of an IFRAME element enables full code execution, allowing an attacker to download/upload
  files, information, etc. The SCRIPT element was also found to be injectable. On the Windows
  operating system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol.
  In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script on
  an SMB share within an IFRAME element, for example: <IFRAME src=\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\Temp\test.html>
  and then replying to it. The included JavaScript code is then executed automatically, without
  any interaction needed from the user. The vulnerability can be triggered in the Signal-Desktop
  client by sending a specially crafted message and then replying to it with any text or content
  in the reply (it doesn''t matter).'
