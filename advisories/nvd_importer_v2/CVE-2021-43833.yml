aliases: []
summary: eLabFTW is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams. In versions prior
  to 4.2.0 there is a vulnerability which allows any authenticated user to gain access to arbitrary
  accounts by setting a specially crafted email address. This vulnerability impacts all instances
  that have not set an explicit email domain name allowlist. Note that whereas neither administrators
  nor targeted users are notified of a change, an attacker will need to control an account.
  The default settings require administrators to validate newly created accounts. The problem
  has been patched. Users should upgrade to at least version 4.2.0. For users unable to upgrade
  enabling an email domain allow list (from Sysconfig panel, Security tab) will completely resolve
  the issue.
