summary: 'NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.  PHP remote code injection vulnerability
  in loader.php for Ariadne CMS 2.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by
  modifying the ariadne parameter to reference a URL on a remote web server that contains the
  code.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that loader.php first requires the
  "ariadne.inc" file, which defines the $ariadne variable, and thus it cannot be modified by
  an attacker. In addition, CVE personnel have partially verified the dispute via source code
  inspection of Ariadne 2.4 as available on July 5, 2005'
