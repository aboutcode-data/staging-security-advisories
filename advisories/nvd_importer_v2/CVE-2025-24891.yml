aliases: []
summary: Dumb Drop is a file upload application. Users with permission to upload to the service
  are able to exploit a path traversal vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary system files. As
  the container runs as root by default, there is no limit to what can be overwritten. With
  this, it's possible to inject malicious payloads into files ran on schedule or upon certain
  service actions. As the service is not required to run with authentication enabled, this may
  permit wholly unprivileged users root access. Otherwise, anybody with a PIN.
