summary: The Advanced Database Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  attackers to alter the keep last setting via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
