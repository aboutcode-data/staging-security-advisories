  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix object lifecycle issue in update_qos_request()

  The cpufreq_cpu_put() call in update_qos_request() takes place too early
  because the latter subsequently calls freq_qos_update_request() that
  indirectly accesses the policy object in question through the QoS request
  object passed to it.

  Fortunately, update_qos_request() is called under intel_pstate_driver_lock,
  so this issue does not matter for changing the intel_pstate operation
  mode, but it theoretically can cause a crash to occur on CPU device hot
  removal (which currently can only happen in virt, but it is formally
  supported nevertheless).

  Address this issue by modifying update_qos_request() to drop the
  reference to the policy later.
