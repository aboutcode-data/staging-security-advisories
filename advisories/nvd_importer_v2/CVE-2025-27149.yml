aliases: []
summary: Zulip server provides an open-source team chat that helps teams stay productive and
  focused. Prior to 10.0, the data export to organization administrators feature in Zulip leaks
  private data. The collection of user-agent types identifying specific integrations or HTTP
  libraries (E.g., ZulipGitlabWebhook, okhttp, or PycURL) that have been used to access any
  organization on the server was incorrectly included in all three export types, regardless
  of if they were used to access the exported organization or not. The "public data" and "with
  consent" exports metadata including the titles of some topics in private channels which the
  administrator otherwise did not have access to, and none of the users consented to exporting
  and metadata for which users were in a group DM together. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.0.
