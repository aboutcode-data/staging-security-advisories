aliases: []
summary: CNCF Harbor 2.13.x before 2.13.1 and 2.12.x before 2.12.4 allows information disclosure
  by administrators who can exploit an ORM Leak present in the /api/v2.0/users endpoint to leak
  users' password hash and salt values. The q URL parameter allows a user to filter users by
  any column, and filter password=~ could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character
  by character. An attacker with administrator access could exploit this to leak highly sensitive
  information stored in the Harbor database. All endpoints that support the q URL parameter
  are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack.
