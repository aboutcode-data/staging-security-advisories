aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the shared library loading mechanism of Cisco AnyConnect Secure
  Mobility Client for Linux and Mac OS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform
  a shared library hijacking attack on an affected device if the VPN Posture (HostScan) Module
  is installed on the AnyConnect client. This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the
  signature verification process for shared library files that are loaded on an affected device.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication
  (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker must have a valid account on the system.
