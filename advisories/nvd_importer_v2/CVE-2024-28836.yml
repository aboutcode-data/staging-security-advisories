aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS 3.5.x before 3.6.0. When negotiating the TLS version
  on the server side, it can fall back to the TLS 1.2 implementation of the protocol if it is
  disabled. If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at build time, a TLS 1.2 client could
  put a TLS 1.3-only server into an infinite loop processing a TLS 1.2 ClientHello, resulting
  in a denial of service. If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at runtime, a TLS 1.2 client
  can successfully establish a TLS 1.2 connection with the server.
