aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. There is an error in the stack
  management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated.
  The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot
  be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow
  that would cache the `key` was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling
  the compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper
  code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.
