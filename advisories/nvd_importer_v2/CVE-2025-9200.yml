summary: The Blappsta Mobile App Plugin – Your native, mobile iPhone App and Android App plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the nh_ynaa_comments() function in all versions
  up to, and including, 0.8.8.8 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter
  and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that
  can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
