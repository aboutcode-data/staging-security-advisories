aliases: []
summary: Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to 0.7.5, it is
  possible for a user who can commit files to a repository hosted by Soft Serve to execute arbitrary
  code via environment manipulation and Git. The issue is that Soft Serve passes all environment
  variables given by the client to git subprocesses. This includes environment variables that
  control program execution, such as LD_PRELOAD. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.5.
