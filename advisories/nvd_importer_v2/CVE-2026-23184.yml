  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  binder: fix UAF in binder_netlink_report()

  Oneway transactions sent to frozen targets via binder_proc_transaction()
  return a BR_TRANSACTION_PENDING_FROZEN error but they are still treated
  as successful since the target is expected to thaw at some point. It is
  then not safe to access 't' after BR_TRANSACTION_PENDING_FROZEN errors
  as the transaction could have been consumed by the now thawed target.

  This is the case for binder_netlink_report() which derreferences 't'
  after a pending frozen error, as pointed out by the following KASAN
  report:

    ==================================================================

  Instead, make a transaction copy so the data can be safely accessed by
  binder_netlink_report() after a pending frozen error. While here, add a
  comment about not using t->buffer in binder_netlink_report().
