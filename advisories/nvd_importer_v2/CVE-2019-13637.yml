aliases: []
summary: In LogMeIn join.me before 3.16.0.5505, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands
  on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due to unsafe search paths used by the application
  URI that is defined in Windows. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing
  a targeted user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could cause the application
  to load libraries from the directory targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this
  behavior to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the targeted user
  if the attacker can place a crafted library in a directory that is accessible to the vulnerable
  system.
