aliases: []
summary: go-merkledag implements the 'DAGService' interface and adds two ipld node types, Protobuf
  and Raw for the ipfs project. A `ProtoNode` may be modified in such a way as to cause various
  encode errors which will trigger a panic on common method calls that don't allow for error
  returns. A `ProtoNode` should only be able to encode to valid DAG-PB, attempting to encode
  invalid DAG-PB forms will result in an error from the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly
  created or decoded) `ProtoNode` using the modifier methods did not account for certain states
  that would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form. Due to conformance with the [`github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block)
  and [`github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node)
  interfaces, certain methods, which internally require a re-encode if state has changed, will
  panic due to the inability to return an error. This issue has been addressed across a number
  of pull requests. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.8.1 for a complete set of fixes.
  Users unable to upgrade may attempt to mitigate this issue by sanitising inputs when allowing
  user-input to set a new `CidBuilder` on a `ProtoNode` and by sanitising `Tsize` (`Link#Size`)
  values such that they are a reasonable byte-size for sub-DAGs where derived from user-input.
