summary: A vulnerability was discovered in the Arctera InfoScale 7.0 through 8.0.2 where a .NET
  remoting endpoint can be exploited due to the insecure deserialization of potentially untrusted
  messages. The vulnerability is present in the Windows Plugin_Host service, which runs on all
  the servers where InfoScale is installed. The service is used only when applications are configured
  for Disaster Recovery (DR) using the DR wizard. Disabling the Plugin_Host service manually
  will eliminate the vulnerability.
