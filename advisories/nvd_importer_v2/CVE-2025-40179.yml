  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ext4: verify orphan file size is not too big

  In principle orphan file can be arbitrarily large. However orphan replay
  needs to traverse it all and we also pin all its buffers in memory. Thus
  filesystems with absurdly large orphan files can lead to big amounts of
  memory consumed. Limit orphan file size to a sane value and also use
  kvmalloc() for allocating array of block descriptor structures to avoid
  large order allocations for sane but large orphan files.
