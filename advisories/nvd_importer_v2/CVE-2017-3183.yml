aliases: []
summary: Sage XRT Treasury, version 3, fails to properly restrict database access to authorized
  users, which may enable any authenticated user to gain full access to privileged database
  functions. Sage XRT Treasury is a business finance management application. Database user access
  privileges are determined by the USER_CODE field associated with the querying user. By modifying
  the USER_CODE value to match that of a privileged user, a low-privileged, authenticated user
  may gain privileged access to the SQL database. A remote, authenticated user can submit specially
  crafted SQL queries to gain privileged access to the application database.
