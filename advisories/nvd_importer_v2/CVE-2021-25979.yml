aliases: []
summary: Apostrophe CMS versions prior to 3.3.1 did not invalidate existing login sessions when
  disabling a user account or changing the password, creating a situation in which a device
  compromised by a third party could not be locked out by those means. As a mitigation for older
  releases the user account in question can be archived (3.x) or moved to the trash (2.x and
  earlier) which does disable the existing session.
