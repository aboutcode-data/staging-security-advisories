aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup from a romfs filesystem,
  grub's romfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry
  to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows.
  A maliciously crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow,
  causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result,
  the grub_romfs_read_symlink() may cause out-of-bounds writes when the calling grub_disk_read()
  function. This issue may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and can result
  in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.
