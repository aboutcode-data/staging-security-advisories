  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  parisc: Do not reprogram affinitiy on ASP chip

  The ASP chip is a very old variant of the GSP chip and is used e.g. in
  HP 730 workstations. When trying to reprogram the affinity it will crash
  with a HPMC as the relevant registers don't seem to be at the usual
  location.  Let's avoid the crash by checking the sversion. Also note,
  that reprogramming isn't necessary either, as the HP730 is a just a
  single-CPU machine.
