summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: i2c-hid: fix potential buffer overflow in i2c_hid_get_report()

  `i2c_hid_xfer` is used to read `recv_len + sizeof(__le16)` bytes of data
  into `ihid->rawbuf`.

  The former can come from the userspace in the hidraw driver and is only
  bounded by HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE(16384) by default (unless we also set
  `max_buffer_size` field of `struct hid_ll_driver` which we do not).

  The latter has size determined at runtime by the maximum size of
  different report types you could receive on any particular device and
  can be a much smaller value.

  Fix this by truncating `recv_len` to `ihid->bufsize - sizeof(__le16)`.

  The impact is low since access to hidraw devices requires root.
