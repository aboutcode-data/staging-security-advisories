aliases: []
summary: 'Information leaks in IIS 4 through 5.1 allow remote attackers to obtain potentially
  sensitive information or more easily conduct brute force attacks via responses from the server
  in which (2) in certain configurations, the server IP address is provided as the realm for
  Basic authentication, which could reveal real IP addresses that were obscured by NAT, or (3)
  when NTLM authentication is used, the NetBIOS name of the server and its Windows NT domain
  are revealed in response to an Authorization request.  NOTE: this entry originally contained
  a vector (1) in which the server reveals whether it supports Basic or NTLM authentication
  through 401 Access Denied error messages.  CVE has REJECTED this vector; it is not a vulnerability
  because the information is already available through legitimate use, since authentication
  cannot proceed without specifying a scheme that is supported by both the client and the server.'
