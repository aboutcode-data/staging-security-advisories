summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  riscv: prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads

  Top of the kernel thread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. However
  this is not the case for the idle threads of the secondary boot harts.
  Their stacks overlap with their pt_regs, so both may get corrupted.

  Similar issue has been fixed for the primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28
  ("riscv: prevent stack corruption by reserving task_pt_regs(p) early").
  However that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problem
  has been noticed in some CPU hotplug tests with V enabled. The function
  smp_callin stored several registers on stack, corrupting top of pt_regs
  structure including status field. As a result, kernel attempted to save
  or restore inexistent V context.
