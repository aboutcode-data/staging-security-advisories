aliases: []
summary: "An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can \nescalate his Windows\
  \ user privileges to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by \nexploiting a race condition in the Elefant\
  \ Update Service during the \nrepair or update process. When using the repair function, the\
  \ service queries the server for a \nlist of files and their hashes. In addition, instructions\
  \ to execute \nbinaries to finalize the repair process are included. The executables are executed\
  \ as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" after they are \ncopied over to the user writable installation\
  \ folder (C:\\Elefant1). This\n means that a user can overwrite either \"PostESUUpdate.exe\"\
  \ or \n\"Update_OpenJava.exe\" in the time frame after the copy and before the \nexecution\
  \ of the final repair step. The overwritten executable is then executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\\
  SYSTEM\"."
