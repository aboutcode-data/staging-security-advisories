summary: The Double the Donation – A workplace giving tool to help your fundraising efforts
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
  above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html
  has been disabled.
