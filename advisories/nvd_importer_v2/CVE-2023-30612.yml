aliases: []
summary: Cloud hypervisor is a Virtual Machine Monitor for Cloud workloads. This vulnerability
  allows users to close arbitrary open file descriptors in the Cloud Hypervisor process via
  sending malicious HTTP request through the HTTP API socket. As a result, the Cloud Hypervisor
  process can be easily crashed, causing Deny-of-Service (DoS). This can also be a potential
  Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. Users require to have the write access to the API socket
  file to trigger this vulnerability.  Impacted versions of Cloud Hypervisor include upstream
  main branch, v31.0, and v30.0. The vulnerability was initially detected by our `http_api_fuzzer`
  via oss-fuzz. This issue has been addressed in versions 30.1 and 31.1. Users unable to upgrade
  may mitigate this issue by ensuring the write access to the API socket file is granted to
  trusted users only.
