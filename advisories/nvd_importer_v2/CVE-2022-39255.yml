aliases: []
summary: Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with Matrix. Prior to
  version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages
  that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as
  a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver
  could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device
  messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject
  the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a
  malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol
  confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm.
  matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages.
  Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination
  between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do
  not need a workaround. To avoid malicious backup attacks, one should not verify one's new
  logins using emoji/QR verifications methods until patched.
