aliases: []
summary: Due to a missing authorization check vulnerability in SAP S/4HANA (Enterprise Event
  Enablement), an attacker with access to the Inbound Binding Configuration could create an
  RFC destination and assign an arbitrary high-privilege user. This allows the attacker to consume
  events via the RFC destination, leading to code execution under the privileges of the assigned
  high-privilege user. While the vulnerability has a low impact on Availability, it significantly
  poses a high risk to both Confidentiality and Integrity.
