aliases: []
summary: The WPC Smart Quick View for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
  Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
