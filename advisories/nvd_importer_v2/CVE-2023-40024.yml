aliases: []
summary: ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis pipelines.
  In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized,
  which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to
  access a detailed license view that does not exist. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability
  to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function.
  When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts,
  leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. This
  issue has been addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability.
