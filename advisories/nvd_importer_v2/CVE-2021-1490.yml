aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web
  Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. This vulnerability
  is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to retrieve a crafted file
  that contains malicious payload and upload it to the affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information.
