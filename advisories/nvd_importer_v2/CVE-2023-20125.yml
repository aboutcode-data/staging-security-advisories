summary: "A vulnerability in the local interface of Cisco BroadWorks Network Server could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system resources, causing a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because rate limiting does not occur for\
  \ certain incoming TCP connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ a high rate of TCP connections to the server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause TCP connection resources to grow rapidly until the Cisco BroadWorks Network Server\
  \ becomes unusable.\r\nNote: To recover from this vulnerability, either Cisco BroadWorks Network\
  \ Server software must be restarted or the Cisco BroadWorks Network Server node must be rebooted.\
  \ For more information, see the  section of this advisory.\r\nCisco has released software\
  \ updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
