summary: The csaf_provider package before 0.8.2 allows XSS via a crafted CSAF document uploaded
  as text/html. The endpoint upload allows valid CSAF advisories (JSON format) to be uploaded
  with Content-Type text/html and filenames ending in .html. When subsequently accessed via
  web browser, these advisories are served and interpreted as HTML pages. Such uploaded advisories
  can contain JavaScript code that will execute within the browser context of users inspecting
  the advisory.
