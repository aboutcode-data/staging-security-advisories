summary: "Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability in Apache\
  \ Tomcat. For a subset of unlikely rewrite rule configurations, it was possible \nfor a specially\
  \ crafted request to bypass some rewrite rules. If those \nrewrite rules effectively enforced\
  \ security constraints, those \nconstraints could be bypassed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache\
  \ Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39, from 9.0.0.M1 through\
  \ 9.0.102.\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown\
  \ to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions \nmay also be affected.\n\
  \n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION], which fixes the issue."
