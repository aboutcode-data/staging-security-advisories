aliases: []
summary: Hydra is the layer-two scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to version 0.13.0, not
  signing and verifying `$\mathsf{cid}$` allows an attacker (which must be a participant of
  this head) to use a snapshot from an old head instance with the same participants to close
  the head or contest the state with it. This can lead to an incorrect distribution of value
  (= value extraction attack; hard, but possible) or prevent the head to finalize because the
  value available is not consistent with the closed utxo state (= denial of service; easy).
  A patch is planned for version 0.13.0. As a workaround, rotate keys between heads so not to
  re-use keys and not result in the same multi-signature participants.
