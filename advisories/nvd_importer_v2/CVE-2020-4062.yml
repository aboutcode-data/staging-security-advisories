aliases: []
summary: 'In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability
  resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows
  an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating
  the attacker''s privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address
  and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where
  Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker
  to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method
  to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only
  Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker
  and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability,
  clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully
  remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure
  Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term "isolated"
  refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in
  that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is
  limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).'
