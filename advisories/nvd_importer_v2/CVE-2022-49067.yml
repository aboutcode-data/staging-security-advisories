  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  powerpc: Fix virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit Book3E & 32-bit

  mpe: On 64-bit Book3E vmalloc space starts at 0x8000000000000000.

  Because of the way __pa() works we have:
    __pa(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
    virt_to_pfn(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
    virt_addr_valid(0x8000000000000000) == true

  Which is wrong, virt_addr_valid() should be false for vmalloc space.
  In fact all vmalloc addresses that alias with a valid PFN will return
  true from virt_addr_valid(). That can cause bugs with hardened usercopy
  as described below by Kefeng Wang:

    When running ethtool eth0 on 64-bit Book3E, a BUG occurred:

      usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object not in SLUB page?! (offset 0, size 1048)!
      kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:99
      ...
      usercopy_abort+0x64/0xa0 (unreliable)
      __check_heap_object+0x168/0x190
      __check_object_size+0x1a0/0x200
      dev_ethtool+0x2494/0x2b20
      dev_ioctl+0x5d0/0x770
      sock_do_ioctl+0xf0/0x1d0
      sock_ioctl+0x3ec/0x5a0
      __se_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x160
      system_call_exception+0xfc/0x1f0
      system_call_common+0xf8/0x200

    The code shows below,

      data = vzalloc(array_size(gstrings.len, ETH_GSTRING_LEN));
      copy_to_user(useraddr, data, gstrings.len * ETH_GSTRING_LEN))

    The data is alloced by vmalloc(), virt_addr_valid(ptr) will return true
    on 64-bit Book3E, which leads to the panic.

    As commit 4dd7554a6456 ("powerpc/64: Add VIRTUAL_BUG_ON checks for __va
    and __pa addresses") does, make sure the virt addr above PAGE_OFFSET in
    the virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit, also add upper limit check to make
    sure the virt is below high_memory.

    Meanwhile, for 32-bit PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address of the start
    of lowmem, high_memory is the upper low virtual address, the check is
    suitable for 32-bit, this will fix the issue mentioned in commit
    602946ec2f90 ("powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly") too.

  On 32-bit there is a similar problem with high memory, that was fixed in
  commit 602946ec2f90 ("powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly"), but that
  commit breaks highmem and needs to be reverted.

  We can't easily fix __pa(), we have code that relies on its current
  behaviour. So for now add extra checks to virt_addr_valid().

  For 64-bit Book3S the extra checks are not necessary, the combination of
  virt_to_pfn() and pfn_valid() should yield the correct result, but they
  are harmless.
