aliases: []
summary: The String Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted
  input via the 'string-locator-path' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.5.0. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated users to call files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link, that
  will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious
  actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful
  in uploading a file with the serialized payload.
