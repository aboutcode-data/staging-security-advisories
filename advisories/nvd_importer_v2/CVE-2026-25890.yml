aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to 2.57.1, an authenticated
  user can bypass the application's "Disallow" file path rules by modifying the request URL.
  By adding multiple slashes (e.g., //private/) to the path, the authorization check fails to
  match the rule, while the underlying filesystem resolves the path correctly, granting unauthorized
  access to restricted files. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.57.1.
