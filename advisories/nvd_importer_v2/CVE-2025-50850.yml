aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in CS Cart 4.18.3 allows the vendor login functionality lacks
  essential security controls such as CAPTCHA verification and rate limiting. This allows an
  attacker to systematically attempt various combinations of usernames and passwords (brute-force
  attack) to gain unauthorized access to vendor accounts. The absence of any blocking mechanism
  makes the login endpoint susceptible to automated attacks.
