summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mshv: Fix create memory region overlap check

  The current check is incorrect; it only checks if the beginning or end
  of a region is within an existing region. This doesn't account for
  userspace specifying a region that begins before and ends after an
  existing region.

  Change the logic to a range intersection check against gfns and uaddrs
  for each region.

  Remove mshv_partition_region_by_uaddr() as it is no longer used.
