aliases: []
summary: In solidus before versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6, and 2.10.2, there is an bility to change order
  address without triggering address validations. This vulnerability allows a malicious customer
  to craft request data with parameters that allow changing the address of the current order
  without changing the shipment costs associated with the new shipment. All stores with at least
  two shipping zones and different costs of shipment per zone are impacted. This problem comes
  from how checkout permitted attributes are structured. We have a single list of attributes
  that are permitted across the whole checkout, no matter the step that is being submitted.
  See the linked reference for more information. As a workaround, if it is not possible to upgrade
  to a supported patched version, please use this gist in the references section.
