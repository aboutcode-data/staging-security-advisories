summary: Fleet is open source device management software. A SQL injection vulnerability in versions
  prior to 4.80.1 allowed authenticated users to inject arbitrary SQL expressions via the `order_key`
  query parameter. Due to unsafe use of `goqu.I()` when constructing the `ORDER BY` clause,
  specially crafted input could escape identifier quoting and be interpreted as executable SQL.
  An authenticated attacker with access to the affected endpoint could inject SQL expressions
  into the underlying MySQL query. Although the injection occurs in an `ORDER BY` context, it
  is sufficient to enable blind SQL injection techniques that can disclose database information
  through conditional expressions that affect result ordering. Crafted expressions may also
  cause excessive computation or query failures, potentially leading to degraded performance
  or denial of service. No direct evidence of reliable data modification or stacked query execution
  was demonstrated. Version 4.80.1 fixes the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible,
  users should restrict access to the affected endpoint to trusted roles only and ensure that
  any user-supplied sort or column parameters are strictly allow-listed at the application or
  proxy layer.
