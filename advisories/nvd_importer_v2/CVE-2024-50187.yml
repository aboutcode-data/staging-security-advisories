summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/vc4: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyed

  Upon closing the file descriptor, the active performance monitor is not
  stopped. Although all perfmons are destroyed in `vc4_perfmon_close_file()`,
  the active performance monitor's pointer (`vc4->active_perfmon`) is still
  retained.

  If we open a new file descriptor and submit a few jobs with performance
  monitors, the driver will attempt to stop the active performance monitor
  using the stale pointer in `vc4->active_perfmon`. However, this pointer
  is no longer valid because the previous process has already terminated,
  and all performance monitors associated with it have been destroyed and
  freed.

  To fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a given
  process, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it.
