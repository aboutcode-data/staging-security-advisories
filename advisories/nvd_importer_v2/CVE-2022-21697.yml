summary: Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy web services.
  Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery
  (SSRF). Any user deploying Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension
  enabled is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients to proxy requests
  to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check. Because authentication is required, which
  already grants permissions to make the same requests via kernel or terminal execution, this
  is considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade to version 3.2.1 to receive a patch
  or, as a workaround, install the patch manually.
