aliases: []
summary: OpenProject is the leading open source project management software. OpenProject utilizes
  `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can
  lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires
  the permissions "Edit work packages" as well as "Add attachments". A project admin could attempt
  to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System
  Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's
  attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's
  CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0,
  14.0.2 and 13.4.2.
