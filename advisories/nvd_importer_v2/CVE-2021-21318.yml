aliases: []
summary: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio
  and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing
  an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows
  for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding
  the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module
  and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event
  will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing
  the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access
  or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this
  may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the
  merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available
  although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast
  9.2.
