aliases: []
summary: Smokescreen is an HTTP proxy. The primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side
  request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the behavior of applications
  to connect to or scan internal infrastructure. Smokescreen also offers an option to deny access
  to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There was an issue in Smokescreen
  that made it possible to bypass the deny list feature by surrounding the hostname with square
  brackets (e.g. `[example.com]`). This only impacted the HTTP proxy functionality of Smokescreen.
  HTTPS requests were not impacted. Smokescreen version 0.0.4 contains a patch for this issue.
