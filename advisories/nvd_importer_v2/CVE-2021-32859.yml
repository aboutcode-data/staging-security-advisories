aliases: []
summary: The Baremetrics date range picker is a solution for selecting both date ranges and
  single dates from a single calender view. Versions 1.0.14 and prior are prone to cross-site
  scripting (XSS) when handling untrusted `placeholder` entries. An attacker who is able to
  influence the field `placeholder` when creating a `Calendar` instance is able to supply arbitrary
  `html` or `javascript` that will be rendered in the context of a user leading to XSS. There
  are no known patches for this issue.
