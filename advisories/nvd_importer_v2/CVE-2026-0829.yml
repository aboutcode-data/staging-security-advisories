summary: The Frontend File Manager Plugin WordPress plugin through 23.5 allows unauthenticated
  users to send emails through the site without any security checks. This lets attackers use
  the WordPress site as an open relay for spam or phishing emails to anyone. Attackers can also
  guess file IDs to access and share uploaded files without permission, exposing sensitive information.
