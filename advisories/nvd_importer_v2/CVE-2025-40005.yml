  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  spi: cadence-quadspi: Implement refcount to handle unbind during busy

  driver support indirect read and indirect write operation with
  assumption no force device removal(unbind) operation. However
  force device removal(removal) is still available to root superuser.

  Unbinding driver during operation causes kernel crash. This changes
  ensure driver able to handle such operation for indirect read and
  indirect write by implementing refcount to track attached devices
