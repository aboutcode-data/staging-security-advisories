aliases: []
summary: Syncthing is an open source, continuous file synchronization program. In versions prior
  to 1.23.5 a compromised instance with shared folders could sync malicious files which contain
  arbitrary HTML and JavaScript in the name. If the owner of another device looks over the shared
  folder settings and moves the mouse over the latest sync, a script could be executed to change
  settings for shared folders or add devices automatically. Additionally adding a new device
  with a malicious name could embed HTML or JavaScript inside parts of the page. As a result
  the webUI may be subject to a stored cross site scripting attack. This issue has been addressed
  in version 1.23.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid sharing
  folders with untrusted users.
