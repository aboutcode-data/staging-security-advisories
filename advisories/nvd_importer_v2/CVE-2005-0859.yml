summary: 'PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in CzarNews 1.13b allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary PHP code via the tpath parameter to (1) headlines.php or (2) news.php.  NOTE:
  some sources have reported the "dir" parameter as being affected; however, this is likely
  a cut-and-paste error from the wrong section of the original vulnerability report.  Also,
  the news.php version was later reported to be in 1.12 through 1.14.'
