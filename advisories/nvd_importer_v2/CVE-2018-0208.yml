summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the (cloud based) Cisco Registered
  Envelope Service could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected service.
  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed
  by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this

  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface
  or access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg74126.'
