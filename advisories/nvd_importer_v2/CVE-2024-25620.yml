aliases: []
summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes
  resources. When either the Helm client or SDK is used to save a chart whose name within the
  `Chart.yaml` file includes a relative path change, the chart would be saved outside its expected
  directory based on the changes in the relative path. The validation and linting did not detect
  the path changes in the name. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.1. Users unable to
  upgrade should check all charts used by Helm for path changes in their name as found in the
  `Chart.yaml` file. This includes dependencies.
