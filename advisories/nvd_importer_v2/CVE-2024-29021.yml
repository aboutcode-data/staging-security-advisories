aliases: []
summary: Judge0 is an open-source online code execution system. The default configuration of
  Judge0 leaves the service vulnerable to a sandbox escape via Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
  This allows an attacker with sufficient access to the Judge0 API to obtain unsandboxed code
  execution as root on the target machine. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.1.
