aliases: []
summary: Data Center Expert, versions 7.5.0 and earlier, allows for the upload of a zip file
  from its user interface to the server. A carefully crafted, malicious file could be mistakenly
  uploaded by an authenticated user via this feature which could contain path traversal file
  names. As such, it could allow for the arbitrary upload of files contained with the zip onto
  the server file system outside of the intended directory. This is leveraging the more commonly
  known ZipSlip vulnerability within Java code.
