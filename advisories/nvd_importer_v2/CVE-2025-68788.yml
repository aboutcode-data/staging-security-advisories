aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fsnotify: do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files

  inotify/fanotify do not allow users with no read access to a file to
  subscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but they do allow the
  same user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user
  has access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).

  Users with no read access to a file but with read access to its parent
  directory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified
  via atime/mtime change.

  The same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will not
  generally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to
  special files, only when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().

  Align fsnotify events with this stat behavior and do not generate
  ACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.
  The events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This
  closes some side-channels that could be possibly used for information
  exfiltration [1].
