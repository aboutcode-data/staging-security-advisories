aliases: []
summary: Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0 authentication Service Provider
  plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin
  is not enabled by default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to exploit
  the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack
  could potentially allow the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed
  during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed
  by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks
  such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF)
  on the CloudStack management server.
