aliases: []
summary: Docker Model Runner (DMR) is software used to manage, run, and deploy AI models using
  Docker. Versions prior to 1.0.16 expose a  POST `/engines/_configure`  endpoint that accepts
  arbitrary runtime flags without authentication. These flags are passed directly to the underlying
  inference server (llama.cpp). By injecting the  --log-file  flag, an attacker with network
  access to the Model Runner API can write or overwrite arbitrary files accessible to the Model
  Runner process. When bundled with Docker Desktop (where Model Runner is enabled by default
  since version 4.46.0), it is reachable from any default container at  model-runner.docker.internal  without
  authentication. In this context, the file overwrite can target the Docker Desktop VM disk
  (`Docker.raw` ), resulting in the destruction of all containers, images, volumes, and build
  history. However, in specific configurations and with user interaction, it is possible to
  convert this vulnerability in a container escape. The issue is fixed in Docker Model Runner
  1.0.16. Docker Desktop users should update to 4.61.0 or later, which includes the fixed Model
  Runner. A workaround is available. For Docker Desktop users, enabling Enhanced Container Isolation
  (ECI) blocks container access to Model Runner, preventing exploitation. However, if the Docker
  Model Runner is exposed to localhost over TCP in specific configurations, the vulnerability
  is still exploitable.
