aliases: []
summary: The Store Locator for WordPress with Google Maps – LotsOfLocales plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in version 3.98.9 via the 'sl_engine' parameter. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on
  the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass
  access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and
  other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
