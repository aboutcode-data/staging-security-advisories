aliases: []
summary: The JustClick registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping on the `PHP_SELF` server variable. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
