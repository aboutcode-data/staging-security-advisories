summary: The Grid Gallery – Photo Image Grid Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP
  Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 via deserialization via shortcode
  of untrusted input from the awl_gg_settings_ meta value. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present
  in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed
  on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive
  data, or execute code.
