  ALSA: hda/hdmi: Fix breakage at probing nvhdmi-mcp driver

  After restructuring and splitting the HDMI codec driver code, each
  HDMI codec driver contains the own build_controls and build_pcms ops.
  A copy-n-paste error put the wrong entries for nvhdmi-mcp driver; both
  build_controls and build_pcms are swapped.  Unfortunately both
  callbacks have the very same form, and the compiler didn't complain
  it, either.  This resulted in a NULL dereference because the PCM
  instance hasn't been initialized at calling the build_controls
  callback.

  Fix it by passing the proper entries.
