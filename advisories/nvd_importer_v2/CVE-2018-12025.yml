aliases: []
summary: 'The transferFrom function of a smart contract implementation for FuturXE (FXE), an
  Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to accomplish an unauthorized transfer of digital assets
  because of a logic error. The developer messed up with the boolean judgment - if the input
  value is smaller than or equal to allowed value, the transfer session would stop execution
  by returning false. This makes no sense, because the transferFrom() function should require
  the transferring value to not exceed the allowed value in the first place. Suppose this function
  asks for the allowed value to be smaller than the input. Then, the attacker could easily ignore
  the allowance: after this condition, the `allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;` would cause
  an underflow because the allowed part is smaller than the value. The attacker could transfer
  any amount of FuturXe tokens of any accounts to an appointed account (the `_to` address) because
  the allowed value is initialized to 0, and the attacker could bypass this restriction even
  without the victim''s private key.'
