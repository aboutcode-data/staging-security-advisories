aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability has been found in Heimdal PRO v2.2.190, but it is most likely also
  present in Heimdal FREE and Heimdal CORP. Faulty permissions on the directory "C:\ProgramData\Heimdal
  Security\Heimdal Agent" allow BUILTIN\Users to write new files to the directory. On startup,
  the process Heimdal.MonitorServices.exe running as SYSTEM will attempt to load version.dll
  from this directory. Placing a malicious version.dll in this directory will result in privilege
  escalation. NOTE: any affected Heimdal products are completely unrelated to the Heimdal vendor
  of a Kerberos 5 product on the h5l.org web site.'
