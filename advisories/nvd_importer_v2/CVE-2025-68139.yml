aliases: []
summary: EVerest is an EV charging software stack. In all versions up to and including 2025.12.1,
  the default value for `terminate_connection_on_failed_response` is `False`, which leaves the
  responsibility for session and connection termination to the EV. In this configuration, any
  errors encountered by the module are logged but do not trigger countermeasures such as session
  and connection reset or termination. This could be abused by a malicious user in order to
  exploit other weaknesses or vulnerabilities. While the default will stay at the setting that
  is described as potentially problematic in this reported issue, a mitigation is available
  by changing the `terminate_connection_on_failed_response`  setting to `true`. However this
  cannot be set to this value by default since it can trigger errors in vehicle ECUs requiring
  ECU resets and lengthy unavailability in charging for vehicles. The maintainers judge this
  to be a much more important workaround then short-term unavailability of an EVSE, therefore
  this setting will stay at the current value.
