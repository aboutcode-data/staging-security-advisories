aliases: []
summary: Autocaliweb is a web app that offers an interface for browsing, reading, and downloading
  eBooks using a valid Calibre database. Prior to version 0.8.3, the debug pack generated by
  Autocaliweb can expose sensitive configuration data, including API keys. This occurs because
  the to_dict() method, used to serialize configuration for the debug pack, doesn't adequately
  filter out sensitive fields such as API tokens. Users, unaware of the full contents, might
  share these debug packs, inadvertently leaking their private API keys. This issue has been
  patched in version 0.8.3.
