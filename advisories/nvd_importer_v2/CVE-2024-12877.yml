aliases: []
summary: The GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.19.2 via deserialization of
  untrusted input from the donation form like 'firstName'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers
  to delete arbitrary files on the server that makes remote code execution possible. Please
  note this was only partially patched in 3.19.3, a fully sufficient patch was not released
  until 3.19.4. However, another CVE was assigned by another CNA for version 3.19.3 so we will
  leave this as affecting 3.19.2 and before. We have recommended the vendor use JSON encoding
  to prevent any further deserialization vulnerabilities from being present.
