aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to versions 20.0.13,
  21.0.5, and 22.2.0, a file traversal vulnerability makes an attacker able to download arbitrary
  SVG images from the host system, including user provided files. This could also be leveraged
  into a XSS/phishing attack, an attacker could upload a malicious SVG file that mimics the
  Nextcloud login form and send a specially crafted link to victims. The XSS risk here is mitigated
  due to the fact that Nextcloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy disallowing execution
  of arbitrary JavaScript. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13,
  21.0.5 or 22.2.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
