summary: OpenList Frontend is a UI component for OpenList. Prior to version 4.0.0-rc.4, a vulnerability
  exists in the file preview/browsing feature of the application, where files with a .py extension
  that contain JavaScript code wrapped in <script> tags may be interpreted and executed as HTML
  in certain modes. This leads to a stored XSS vulnerability. This issue has been patched in
  version 4.0.0-rc.4.
