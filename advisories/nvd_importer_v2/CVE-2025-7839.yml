aliases: []
summary: The Restore Permanently delete Post or Page Data plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing
  or incorrect nonce validation on the rp_dpo_dpa_ajax_dp_delete_data() function. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete data via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
