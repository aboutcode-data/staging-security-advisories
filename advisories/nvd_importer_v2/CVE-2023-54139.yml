aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tracing/user_events: Ensure write index cannot be negative

  The write index indicates which event the data is for and accesses a
  per-file array. The index is passed by user processes during write()
  calls as the first 4 bytes. Ensure that it cannot be negative by
  returning -EINVAL to prevent out of bounds accesses.

  Update ftrace self-test to ensure this occurs properly.
