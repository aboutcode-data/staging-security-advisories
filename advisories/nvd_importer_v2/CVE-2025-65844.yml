aliases: []
summary: EverShop 2.0.1 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files and
  create directories via the /api/images endpoint. The endpoint is accessible without authentication
  by default, and server-side validation of uploaded files is insufficient. This can be abused
  to upload arbitrary content (including non-image files) which could impersonate user/admin
  login panels (exfiltrating credentials) and to perform a denial-of-service attack by exhausting
  disk space.
