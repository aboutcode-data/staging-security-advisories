aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  of/fdt: run soc memory setup when early_init_dt_scan_memory fails

  If memory has been found early_init_dt_scan_memory now returns 1. If
  it hasn't found any memory it will return 0, allowing other memory
  setup mechanisms to carry on.

  Previously early_init_dt_scan_memory always returned 0 without
  distinguishing between any kind of memory setup being done or not. Any
  code path after the early_init_dt_scan memory call in the ramips
  plat_mem_setup code wouldn't be executed anymore. Making
  early_init_dt_scan_memory the only way to initialize the memory.

  Some boards, including my mt7621 based Cudy X6 board, depend on memory
  initialization being done via the soc_info.mem_detect function
  pointer. Those wouldn't be able to obtain memory and panic the kernel
  during early bootup with the message "early_init_dt_alloc_memory_arch:
  Failed to allocate 12416 bytes align=0x40".
