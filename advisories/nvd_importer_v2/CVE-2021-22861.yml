aliases: []
summary: An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server
  that allowed authenticated users of the instance to gain write access to unauthorized repositories
  via specifically crafted pull requests and REST API requests. An attacker would need to be
  able to fork the targeted repository, a setting that is disabled by default for organization
  owned private repositories. Branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status
  checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation.
  This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server since 2.4.21 and was
  fixed in versions 2.20.24, 2.21.15, 2.22.7 and 3.0.1. This vulnerability was reported via
  the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
