aliases: []
summary: 'Craft CMS through 3.7.36 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker, who knows at least
  one valid username, to reset the account''s password and take over the account by providing
  a crafted HTTP header to the application while using the password reset functionality. Specifically,
  the attacker must send X-Forwarded-Host to the /index.php?p=admin/actions/users/send-password-reset-email
  URI. NOTE: the vendor''s position is that a customer can already work around this by adjusting
  the configuration (i.e., by not using the default configuration).'
