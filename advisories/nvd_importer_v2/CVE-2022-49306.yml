aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: dwc3: host: Stop setting the ACPI companion

  It is no longer needed. The sysdev pointer is now used when
  assigning the ACPI companions to the xHCI ports and USB
  devices.

  Assigning the ACPI companion here resulted in the
  fwnode->secondary pointer to be replaced also for the parent
  dwc3 device since the primary fwnode (the ACPI companion)
  was shared. That was unintentional and it created potential
  side effects like resource leaks.
