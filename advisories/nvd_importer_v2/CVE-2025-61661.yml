aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability has been identified in the GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) component.
  This flaw occurs because the bootloader mishandles string conversion when reading information
  from a USB device, allowing an attacker to exploit inconsistent length values. A local attacker
  can connect a maliciously configured USB device during the boot sequence to trigger this issue.
  A successful exploitation may lead GRUB to crash, leading to a Denial of Service. Data corruption
  may be also possible, although given the complexity of the exploit the impact is most likely
  limited.
