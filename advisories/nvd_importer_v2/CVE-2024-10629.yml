aliases: []
summary: The GPX Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation due to
  a missing capability check and file type validation in the gpxv_file_upload() function in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible.
