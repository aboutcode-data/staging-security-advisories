aliases: []
summary: Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in
  PHP. SQL injection vulnerability exist in multiple files in Time Tracker version 1.19.33.5606
  and prior due to not properly checking of the "group" and "status" parameters in POST requests.
  Group parameter is posted along when navigating between organizational subgroups (groups.php
  file). Status parameter is used in multiple files to change a status of an entity such as
  making a project, task, or user inactive. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.33.5607.
  An upgrade is highly recommended. If an upgrade is not practical, introduce ttValidStatus
  function as in the latest version and start using it user input check blocks wherever status
  field is used. For groups.php fix, introduce ttValidInteger function as in the latest version
  and use it in the access check block in the file.
