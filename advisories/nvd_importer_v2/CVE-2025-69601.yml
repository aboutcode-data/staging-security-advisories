aliases: []
summary: A directory traversal (Zip Slip) vulnerability exists in the “Static Sites” feature
  of 66biolinks v44.0.0 by AltumCode. Uploaded ZIP archives are automatically extracted without
  validating or sanitizing file paths. An attacker can include traversal sequences (e.g., ../)
  in ZIP entries to write files outside the intended extraction directory. This allows static
  files (html, js, css, images) file write to unintended locations, or overwriting existing
  HTML files, potentially leading to content defacement and, in certain deployments, further
  impact if sensitive files are overwritten.
