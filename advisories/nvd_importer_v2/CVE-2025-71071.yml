  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommu/mediatek: fix use-after-free on probe deferral

  The driver is dropping the references taken to the larb devices during
  probe after successful lookup as well as on errors. This can
  potentially lead to a use-after-free in case a larb device has not yet
  been bound to its driver so that the iommu driver probe defers.

  Fix this by keeping the references as expected while the iommu driver is
  bound.
