aliases: []
summary: Django-Unicorn adds modern reactive component functionality to Django templates. Affected
  versions of Django-Unicorn are vulnerable to python class pollution vulnerability. The vulnerability
  arises from the core functionality `set_property_value`, which can be remotely triggered by
  users by crafting appropriate component requests and feeding in values of second and third
  parameter to the vulnerable function, leading to arbitrary changes to the python runtime status.
  With this finding at least five ways of vulnerability exploitation have been observed, stably
  resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Authentication Bypass
  attacks in almost every Django-Unicorn-based application. This issue has been addressed in
  version 0.62.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
  vulnerability.
