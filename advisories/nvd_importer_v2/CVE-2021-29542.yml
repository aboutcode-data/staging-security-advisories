summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker
  can cause a heap buffer overflow by passing crafted inputs to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`. This
  is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1cdd4da14282210cc759e468d9781741ac7d01bf/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L171-L185)
  fails to consider corner cases where input would be split in such a way that the generated
  tokens should only contain padding elements. If input is such that `num_tokens` is 0, then,
  for `data_start_index=0` (when left padding is present), the marked line would result in reading
  `data[-1]`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are
  also affected and still in supported range.
