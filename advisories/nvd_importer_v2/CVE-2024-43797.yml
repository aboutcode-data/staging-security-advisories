aliases: []
summary: audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A non-admin user is not
  allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the
  `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue.
  Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of
  path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this
  is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This
  issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There
  are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
