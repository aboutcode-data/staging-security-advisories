summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64: mte: Do not warn if the page is already tagged in copy_highpage()

  The arm64 copy_highpage() assumes that the destination page is newly
  allocated and not MTE-tagged (PG_mte_tagged unset) and warns
  accordingly. However, following commit 060913999d7a ("mm: migrate:
  support poisoned recover from migrate folio"), folio_mc_copy() is called
  before __folio_migrate_mapping(). If the latter fails (-EAGAIN), the
  copy will be done again to the same destination page. Since
  copy_highpage() already set the PG_mte_tagged flag, this second copy
  will warn.

  Replace the WARN_ON_ONCE(page already tagged) in the arm64
  copy_highpage() with a comment.
