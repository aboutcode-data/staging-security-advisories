summary: e107 CMS version 3.2.1 contains multiple vulnerabilities that allow cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks. The first vulnerability is a reflected XSS that occurs in the news comment
  functionality when authenticated users interact with the comment form. An attacker can inject
  malicious JavaScript code through the URL parameter that gets executed when users click outside
  the comment field after typing content. The second vulnerability involves an upload restriction
  bypass for authenticated administrators, allowing them to upload SVG files containing malicious
  code through the media manager's remote URL upload feature. This results in stored XSS when
  the uploaded SVG files are accessed. These vulnerabilities were discovered by Hubert Wojciechowski
  and affect the news.php and image.php components of the CMS.
