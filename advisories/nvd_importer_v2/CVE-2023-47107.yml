aliases: []
summary: PILOS is an open source front-end for BigBlueButton servers with a built-in load balancer.
  The password reset component deployed within PILOS uses the hostname supplied within the request
  host header when building a password reset URL. It may be possible to manipulate the URL sent
  to PILOS users when so that it points to the attackers server thereby disclosing the password
  reset token if/when the link is followed. This only affects local user accounts and requires
  the password reset option to be enabled. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.0.
