aliases: []
summary: The Flynax Bridge plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators,
  and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
