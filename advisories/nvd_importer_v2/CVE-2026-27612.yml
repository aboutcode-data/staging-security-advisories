aliases: []
summary: Repostat is a React component to fetch and display GitHub repository info. Prior to
  version 1.0.1, the `RepoCard` component is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
  The vulnerability occurs because the component uses React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render
  the repository name (`repo` prop) during the loading state without any sanitization. If a
  developer using this package passes unvalidated user input directly into the `repo` prop (for
  example, reading it from a URL query parameter), an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript
  in the context of the user's browser. In version 1.0.1, the use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML
  has been removed, and the repo prop is now safely rendered using standard React JSX data binding,
  which automatically escapes HTML entities.
