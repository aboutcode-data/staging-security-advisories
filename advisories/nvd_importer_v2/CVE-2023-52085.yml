aliases: []
summary: Winter is a free, open-source content management system. Users with access to backend
  forms that include a ColorPicker FormWidget can provide a value that would then be included
  without further processing in the compilation of custom stylesheets via LESS. This had the
  potential to lead to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability. This issue has been patched in
  v1.2.4.
