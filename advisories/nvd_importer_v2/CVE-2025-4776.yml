summary: The Phlox theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  `data-caption` HTML attribute in all versions up to, and including, 2.17.7 due to insufficient
  input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
