summary: 'A vulnerability in certain system script files that are installed at boot time on
  Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on an affected
  host operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-controlled
  input that is supplied to certain script files of an affected system. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to a script file on an affected system. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary commands
  with root privileges on the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would
  need to authenticate to the affected system by using valid administrator credentials. Cisco
