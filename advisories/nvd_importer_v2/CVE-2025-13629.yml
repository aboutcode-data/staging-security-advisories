aliases: []
summary: The WP Landing Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  'wplp_api_update_text' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  arbitrary post meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
