aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS implementation of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator\
  \ (NDO) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to intercept sensitive information\
  \ from an affected device.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the Cisco NDO Validate\
  \ Peer Certificate site management feature validates the certificates for Cisco Application\
  \ Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), Cisco Cloud Network Controller (CNC), and Cisco\
  \ Nexus Dashboard only when a new site is added or an existing one is reregistered. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by using machine-in-the-middle techniques to intercept\
  \ the traffic between the affected device and Cisco NDO and then using a crafted certificate\
  \ to impersonate the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn\
  \ sensitive information during communications between these devices."
