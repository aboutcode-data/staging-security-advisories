  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/tilcdc: Fix removal actions in case of failed probe

  The drm_kms_helper_poll_fini() and drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() helpers
  should only be called when the device has been successfully registered.
  Currently, these functions are called unconditionally in tilcdc_fini(),
  which causes warnings during probe deferral scenarios.

  [    7.972317] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 23 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic_state_helper.c:175 drm_atomic_helper_crtc_duplicate_state+0x60/0x68

  Fix this by rewriting the failed probe cleanup path using the standard
  goto error handling pattern, which ensures that cleanup functions are
  only called on successfully initialized resources. Additionally, remove
  the now-unnecessary is_registered flag.
