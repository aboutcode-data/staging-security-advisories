aliases: []
summary: ERPNext thru 15.88.1 does not sanitize or remove certain HTML tags specifically `<a>`
  hyperlinks in fields that are intended for plain text. Although JavaScript is blocked (preventing
  XSS), the HTML is still preserved in the generated PDF document. As a result, an attacker
  can inject malicious clickable links into an ERP-generated PDF. Since PDF files generated
  by the ERP system are generally considered trustworthy, users are highly likely to click these
  links, potentially enabling phishing attacks or malware delivery. This issue occurs in the
  Add Quality Goal' function.
