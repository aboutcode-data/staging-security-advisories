aliases: []
summary: n8n is a workflow automation platform. Before 1.106.0, a symlink traversal vulnerability
  was discovered in the Read/Write File node in n8n. While the node attempts to restrict access
  to sensitive directories and files, it does not properly account for symbolic links (symlinks).
  An attacker with the ability to create symlinks—such as by using the Execute Command node—could
  exploit this to bypass the intended directory restrictions and read from or write to otherwise
  inaccessible paths. Users of n8n.cloud are not impacted. Affected users should update to version
  1.106.0 or later.
