aliases: []
summary: Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on Fluture. Using
  `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into
  fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such
  as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server
  were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over
  unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to
  the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available
  in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across
  to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy
  via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies
  available in fluture-node@4.0.2.
