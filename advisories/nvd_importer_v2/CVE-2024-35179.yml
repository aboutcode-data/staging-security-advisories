summary: Stalwart Mail Server is an open-source mail server. Prior to version 0.8.0, when using
  `RUN_AS_USER`, the specified user (and therefore, web interface admins) can read arbitrary
  files as root. This issue affects admins who have set up to run stalwart with `RUN_AS_USER`
  who handed out admin credentials to the mail server but expect these to only grant access
  according to the `RUN_AS_USER` and are attacked where the attackers managed to achieve Arbitrary
  Code Execution using another vulnerability. Version 0.8.0 contains a patch for the issue.
