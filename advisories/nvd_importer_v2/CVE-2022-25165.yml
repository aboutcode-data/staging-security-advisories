aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists
  during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS
  VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client
  service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a
  low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing
  log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files
  content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.
