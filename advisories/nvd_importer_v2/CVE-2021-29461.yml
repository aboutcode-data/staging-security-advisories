aliases: []
summary: Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from
  one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to
  read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code
  execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code
  from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite
  vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains
  the patch.
