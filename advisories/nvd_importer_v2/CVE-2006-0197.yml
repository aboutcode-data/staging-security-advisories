aliases: []
summary: The XClientMessageEvent struct used in certain components of X.Org 6.8.2 and earlier,
  possibly including (1) the X server and (2) Xlib, uses a "long" specifier for elements of
  the l array, which results in inconsistent sizes in the struct on 32-bit versus 64-bit platforms,
  and might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly conduct
  other attacks.
