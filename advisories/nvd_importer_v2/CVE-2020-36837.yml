summary: The ThemeGrill Demo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
  due to a missing capability check on the reset_wizard_actions function in versions 1.3.4 through

  After which, if there is a user named 'admin', the attacker will become automatically logged
  in as an administrator.
