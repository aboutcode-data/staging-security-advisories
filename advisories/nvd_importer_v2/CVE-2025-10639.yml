summary: The WorkExaminer Professional server installation comes with an FTP server that is
  used to receive the client logs on TCP port 12304. An attacker with network access to this
  port can use weak hardcoded credentials to login to the FTP server and modify or read data,
  log files and gain remote code execution as NT Authority\SYSTEM on the server by exchanging
  accessible service binaries in the WorkExaminer installation directory (e.g. "C:\Program File
  (x86)\Work Examiner Professional Server").
