aliases: []
summary: Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things
  devices. The RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite implementations in the Contiki-NG operating system versions
  prior to 4.6 do not validate the address pointer in the RPL source routing header This makes
  it possible for an attacker to cause out-of-bounds writes with packets injected into the network
  stack. Specifically, the problem lies in the rpl_ext_header_srh_update function in the two
  rpl-ext-header.c modules for RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite respectively. The addr_ptr variable
  is calculated using an unvalidated CMPR field value from the source routing header. An out-of-bounds
  write can be triggered on line 151 in os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-ext-header.c and line 261
  in os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-ext-header.c, which contain the following memcpy call with
  addr_ptr as destination. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply a
  patch out-of-band as a workaround.
