summary: 'mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. An authenticated
  admin user can inject a JavaScript payload into the Relay Hosts configuration. The injected
  payload is executed whenever the configuration page is viewed, enabling the attacker to execute
  arbitrary scripts in the context of the user''s browser. This could lead to data theft, or
  further exploitation. This issue has been addressed in the `2024-07` release. All users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
