aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was identified in the NVDA Remote (version 2.6.4) and Tele NVDA Remote
  (version 2025.3.3) remote connection add-ons, which allows an attacker to obtain total control
  of the remote system by guessing a weak password. The problem occurs because these add-ons
  accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer
  verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords,
  many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force
  attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited
  by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection. As a result,
  the attacker gains complete access to the affected system and can execute commands, modify
  files, and compromise user security.
