  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  LoongArch: Define the __io_aw() hook as mmiowb()

  Commit fb24ea52f78e0d595852e ("drivers: Remove explicit invocations of
  mmiowb()") remove all mmiowb() in drivers, but it says:

  "NOTE: mmiowb() has only ever guaranteed ordering in conjunction with
  spin_unlock(). However, pairing each mmiowb() removal in this patch with
  the corresponding call to spin_unlock() is not at all trivial, so there
  is a small chance that this change may regress any drivers incorrectly
  relying on mmiowb() to order MMIO writes between CPUs using lock-free
  synchronisation."

  The mmio in radeon_ring_commit() is protected by a mutex rather than a
  spinlock, but in the mutex fastpath it behaves similar to spinlock. We
  can add mmiowb() calls in the radeon driver but the maintainer says he
  doesn't like such a workaround, and radeon is not the only example of
  mutex protected mmio.

  So we should extend the mmiowb tracking system from spinlock to mutex,
  and maybe other locking primitives. This is not easy and error prone, so
  we solve it in the architectural code, by simply defining the __io_aw()
  hook as mmiowb(). And we no longer need to override queued_spin_unlock()
  so use the generic definition.

  Without this, we get such an error when run 'glxgears' on weak ordering
  architectures such as LoongArch:
