aliases: []
summary: EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, the use of the
  `assert` function to handle errors frequently causes the module to crash. This is particularly
  critical because the manager shuts down all other modules and exits when any one of them terminates,
  leading to a denial of service. In a context where a manager handles multiple EVSE, this would
  also impact other users. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue.
