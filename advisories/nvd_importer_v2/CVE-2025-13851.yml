aliases: []
summary: The Buyent Classified plugin for WordPress (bundled with Buyent theme) is vulnerable
  to privilege escalation via user registration in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7.
  This is due to the plugin not validating or restricting the user role during registration
  via the REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register
  accounts with arbitrary roles, including administrator, by manipulating the _buyent_classified_user_type
  parameter during the registration process, granting them complete control over the WordPress
  site.
