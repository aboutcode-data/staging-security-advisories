aliases: []
summary: TechSupport files generated on Palo Alto Networks VM Series firewalls for Microsoft
  Azure platform configured with high availability (HA) inadvertently collect Azure dashboard
  service account credentials. These credentials are equivalent to the credentials associated
  with the Contributor role in Azure. A user with the credentials will be able to manage all
  the Azure resources in the subscription except for granting access to other resources. These
  credentials do not allow login access to the VMs themselves. This issue affects VM Series
  Plugin versions before 1.0.9 for PAN-OS 9.0. This issue does not affect VM Series in non-HA
  configurations or on other cloud platforms. It does not affect hardware firewall appliances.
  Since becoming aware of the issue, Palo Alto Networks has safely deleted all the tech support
  files with the credentials. We now filter and remove these credentials from all TechSupport
  files sent to us. The TechSupport files uploaded to Palo Alto Networks systems were only accessible
  by authorized personnel with valid Palo Alto Networks credentials. We do not have any evidence
  of malicious access or use of these credentials.
