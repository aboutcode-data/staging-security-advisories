aliases: []
summary: The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol presents no authentication mechanism
  on its version 1.0 (nor authorization) whichs leads to a variety of attacks including identity
  spoofing, unauthorized access, PITM attacks and more. According to literature, version 2.0
  optionally allows for package signing which mitigates this flaw. Another source mentions that
  MAVLink 2.0 only provides a simple authentication system based on HMAC. This implies that
  the flying system overall should add the same symmetric key into all devices of network. If
  not the case, this may cause a security issue, that if one of the devices and its symmetric
  key are compromised, the whole authentication system is not reliable.
