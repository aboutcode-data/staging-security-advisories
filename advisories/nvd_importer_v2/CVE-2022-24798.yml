aliases: []
summary: Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR
  objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses
  relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve
  some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use
  these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances
  that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative
  databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected.
  This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never
  were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no
  known workarounds for this issue.
