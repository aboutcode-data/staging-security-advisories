summary: Cloud Hypervisor is a Virtual Machine Monitor for Cloud workloads. Versions 34.0 through
  50.0 arevulnerable to arbitrary host file exfiltration (constrained by process privileges)
  when using virtio-block devices backed by raw images. A malicious guest can overwrite its
  disk header with a crafted QCOW2 structure pointing to a sensitive host path. Upon the next
  VM boot or disk scan, the image format auto-detection parses this header and serves the host
  file's contents to the guest. Guest-initiated VM reboots are sufficient to trigger a disk
  scan and do not cause the Cloud Hypervisor process to exit. Therefore, a single VM can perform
  this attack without needing interaction from the management stack. Successful exploitation
  requires the backing image to be either writable by the guest or sourced from an untrusted
  origin. Deployments utilizing only trusted, read-only images are not affected. This issue
  has been fixed in version 50.1. To workaround, enable land lock sandboxing and restrict process
  privileges and access.
