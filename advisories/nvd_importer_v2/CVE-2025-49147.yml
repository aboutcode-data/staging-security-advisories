aliases: []
summary: Umbraco, a free and open source .NET content management system, has a vulnerability
  in versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.10 and 13.0.0 through 13.9.1. Via a request to an anonymously
  authenticated endpoint it's possible to retrieve information about the configured password
  requirements. The information available is limited but would perhaps give some additional
  detail useful for someone attempting to brute force derive a user's password. This information
  was not exposed in Umbraco 7 or 8, nor in 14 or higher versions. The vulnerability is patched
  in versions 10.8.11 and 13.9.2.
