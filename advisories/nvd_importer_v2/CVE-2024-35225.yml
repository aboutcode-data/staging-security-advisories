summary: Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their
  notebook server and provide authenticated web access to them. Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4
  and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint
  accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called
  with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes
  the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending
  a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When
  the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`,
  which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript
  can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to
  the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4.
  As a workaround, server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy`
  extension.
