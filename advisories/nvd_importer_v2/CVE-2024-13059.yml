aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm prior to version 1.3.1 allows for path
  traversal due to improper handling of non-ASCII filenames in the multer library. This vulnerability
  can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution.
  The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not
  sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary
  locations on the server.
