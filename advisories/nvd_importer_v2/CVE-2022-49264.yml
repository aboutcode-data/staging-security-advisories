summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  exec: Force single empty string when argv is empty

  Quoting[1] Ariadne Conill:

  "In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the
  second argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting
  a scenario where argc < 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,
  but it is not an explicit requirement[2]:

      The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is
      associated with the process being started by one of the exec
      functions.
  ...
  Interestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],
  but there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.
  Hopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]
  of this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.

  This issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5]."

  While the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be
  mostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL
  (or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]
  existing userspace programs.

  The next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and
  adjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0
  seems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.

  Account for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an
  empty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so
  userspace has some notice about the change:

      process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added

  Additionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.
