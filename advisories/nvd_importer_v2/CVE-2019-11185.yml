summary: The WP Live Chat Support Pro plugin through 8.0.26 for WordPress contains an arbitrary
  file upload vulnerability. This results from an incomplete patch for CVE-2018-12426. Arbitrary
  file upload is achieved by using a non-blacklisted executable file extension in conjunction
  with a whitelisted file extension, and prepending "magic bytes" to the payload to pass MIME
  checks. Specifically, an unauthenticated remote user submits a crafted file upload POST request
  to the REST api remote_upload endpoint. The file contains data that will fool the plugin's
  MIME check into classifying it as an image (which is a whitelisted file extension) and finally
  a trailing .phtml file extension.
