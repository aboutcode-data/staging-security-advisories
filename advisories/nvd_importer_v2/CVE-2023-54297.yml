summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: zoned: fix memory leak after finding block group with super blocks

  At exclude_super_stripes(), if we happen to find a block group that has
  super blocks mapped to it and we are on a zoned filesystem, we error out
  as this is not supposed to happen, indicating either a bug or maybe some
  memory corruption for example. However we are exiting the function without
  freeing the memory allocated for the logical address of the super blocks.
  Fix this by freeing the logical address.
