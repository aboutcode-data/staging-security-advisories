aliases: []
summary: Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration
  (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to
  deploy. Flux CLI allows users to deploy Flux components into a Kubernetes cluster via command-line.
  The vulnerability allows other applications to replace the Flux deployment information with
  arbitrary content which is deployed into the target Kubernetes cluster instead. The vulnerability
  is due to the improper handling of user-supplied input, which results in a path traversal
  that can be controlled by the attacker. Users sharing the same shell between other applications
  and the Flux CLI commands could be affected by this vulnerability. In some scenarios no errors
  may be presented, which may cause end users not to realize that something is amiss. A safe
  workaround is to execute Flux CLI in ephemeral and isolated shell environments, which can
  ensure no persistent values exist from previous processes. However, upgrading to the latest
  version of the CLI is still the recommended mitigation strategy.
