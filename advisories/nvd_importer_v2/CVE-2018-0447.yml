aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the anti-spam protection mechanisms of Cisco AsyncOS Software for
  the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
  bypass certain content filters on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete
  input and validation checking mechanisms for certain Sender Policy Framework (SPF) messages
  that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a customized SPF packet to an affected device. If successful, an exploit could allow the attacker
  to bypass the URL filters that are configured for the affected device, which could allow malicious
  URLs to pass through the device.
