aliases: []
summary: The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion to Remote
  Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.7 via the get_svg() function. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to
  include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code
  in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution. In this specific case,  an attacker can create a form that allows SVG uploads,
  upload an SVG file with malicious content and then include the SVG file in a post to achieve
  remote code execution. This means it is relatively easy to gain remote code execution as a
  contributor-level user and above by default.
