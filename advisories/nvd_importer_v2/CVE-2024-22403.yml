aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud server is a self hosted personal cloud system. In affected versions OAuth
  codes did not expire. When an attacker would get access to an authorization code they could
  authenticate at any time using the code. As of version 28.0.0 OAuth codes are invalidated
  after 10 minutes and will no longer be authenticated. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker
  would need to intercept an OAuth code from a user session. It is recommended that the Nextcloud
  Server is upgraded to 28.0.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
