aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution issue was discovered in GLPI through 9.2.1. There is a race
  condition that allows temporary access to an uploaded executable file that will be disallowed.
  The application allows an authenticated user to upload a file when he/she creates a new ticket
  via front/fileupload.php. This feature is protected using different types of security features
  like the check on the file's extension. However, the application uploads and creates a file,
  though this file is not allowed, and then deletes the file in the uploadFiles method in inc/glpiuploaderhandler.class.php.
