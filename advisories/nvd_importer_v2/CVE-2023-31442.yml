aliases: []
summary: In Lightbend Akka before 2.8.1, the async-dns resolver (used by Discovery in DNS mode
  and transitively by Cluster Bootstrap) uses predictable DNS transaction IDs when resolving
  DNS records, making DNS resolution subject to poisoning by an attacker. If the application
  performing discovery does not validate (e.g., via TLS) the authenticity of the discovered
  service, this may result in exfiltration of application data (e.g., persistence events may
  be published to an unintended Kafka broker). If such validation is performed, then the poisoning
  constitutes a denial of access to the intended service. This affects Akka 2.5.14 through 2.8.0,
  and Akka Discovery through 2.8.0.
