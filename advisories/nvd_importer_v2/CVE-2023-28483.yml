aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Tigergraph Enterprise 3.7.0. The GSQL query language provides
  users with the ability to write data to files on a remote TigerGraph server. The locations
  that a query is allowed to write to are configurable via the GSQL.FileOutputPolicy configuration
  setting. GSQL queries that contain UDFs can bypass this configuration setting and, as a consequence,
  can write to any file location to which the administrative user has access.
