aliases: []
summary: Interactsh is an open-source tool for detecting out-of-band interactions. Domains configured
  with interactsh server prior to version 1.0.0 were vulnerable to subdomain takeover for a
  specific subdomain, i.e `app.` Interactsh server used to create cname entries for `app` pointing
  to `projectdiscovery.github.io` as default, which intended to used for hosting interactsh
  web client using GitHub pages. This is a security issue with a self-hosted interactsh server
  in which the user may not have configured a web client but still have a CNAME entry pointing
  to GitHub pages, making them vulnerable to subdomain takeover. This allows a threat actor
  to host / run arbitrary client side code (cross-site scripting) in a user's browser when browsing
  the vulnerable subdomain. Version 1.0.0 fixes this issue by making CNAME optional, rather
  than default.
