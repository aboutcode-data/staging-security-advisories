aliases: []
summary: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1,
  and 2026.2.0, several webhook endpoints (SendGrid, Mailjet, Mandrill, Postmark, SparkPost)
  in the `WebhooksController` accepted requests without a valid authentication token when no
  token was configured. This allowed unauthenticated attackers to forge webhook payloads and
  artificially inflate user bounce scores, potentially causing legitimate user emails to be
  disabled. The Mailpace endpoint had no token validation at all. Starting in versions 2025.12.2,
  2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0, all webhook endpoints reject requests with a 406 response when no
  authentication token is configured. As a workaround, ensure that webhook authentication tokens
  are configured for all email provider integrations in site settings (e.g., `sendgrid_verification_key`,
  `mailjet_webhook_token`, `postmark_webhook_token`, `sparkpost_webhook_token`). There's no
  current workaround for mailpace before getting this fix.
