aliases: []
summary: SAP Business Warehouse (Process Chains) allows an attacker to manipulate the process
  execution due to missing authorization check. An attacker with display authorization for the
  process chain object could set one or all processes to be skipped. This means corresponding
  activities, such as data loading, activation, or deletion, will not be executed as initially
  modeled. This could lead to unexpected results in business reporting leading to a significant
  impact on integrity. However, there is no impact on confidentiality or availability.
