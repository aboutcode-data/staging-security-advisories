aliases: []
summary: 'Apple Safari for Windows 3.0.3 and earlier does not prompt the user before downloading
  a file, which allows remote attackers to download arbitrary files to the desktop of a client
  system via certain HTML, as demonstrated by a filename in the DATA attribute of an OBJECT
  element. NOTE: it could be argued that this is not a vulnerability because a dangerous file
  is not actually launched, but as of 2007, it is generally accepted that web browsers should
  prompt users before saving dangerous content.'
