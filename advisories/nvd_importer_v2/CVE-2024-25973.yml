aliases: []
summary: The Frentix GmbH OpenOlat LMS is affected by multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  vulnerabilities. An attacker with rights to create or edit groups can create a course with
  a name that contains an XSS payload. Furthermore, attackers with the permissions to create
  or rename a catalog (sub-category) can enter unfiltered input in the name field. In addition,
  attackers who are allowed to create curriculums can also enter unfiltered input in the name
  field. This allows an attacker to execute stored JavaScript code with the permissions of the
  victim in the context of the user's browser.
