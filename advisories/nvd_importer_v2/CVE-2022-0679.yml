aliases: []
summary: The Narnoo Distributor WordPress plugin through 2.5.1 fails to validate and sanitize
  the lib_path parameter before it is passed into a call to require() via the narnoo_distributor_lib_request
  AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users) which results in the
  disclosure of arbitrary files as the content of the file is then displayed in the response
  as JSON data. This could also lead to RCE with various tricks but depends on the underlying
  system and it's configuration.
