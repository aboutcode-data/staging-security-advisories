summary: LibreY is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting
  meta search engine. LibreY is subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
  in the `image_proxy.php` file of LibreY before commit 8f9b9803f231e2954e5b49987a532d28fe50a627.
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests
  to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network or conduct Denial-of-Service
  (DoS) attacks via the `url` parameter. Remote attackers can use the server as a proxy to send
  HTTP GET requests and retrieve information in the internal network. Remote attackers can also
  request the server to download large files or chain requests among multiple instances to reduce
  the performance of the server or even deny access from legitimate users. This issue has been
  addressed in https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/31. LibreY hosters are advised to use
  the latest commit. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
