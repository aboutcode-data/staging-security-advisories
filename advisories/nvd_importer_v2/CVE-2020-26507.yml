aliases: []
summary: A CSV Injection (also known as Formula Injection) vulnerability in the Marmind web
  application with version 4.1.141.0 allows malicious users to gain remote control of other
  computers. By providing formula code in the “Notes” functionality in the main screen, an attacker
  can inject a payload into the “Description” field under the “Insert To-Do” option. Other users
  might download this data, for example a CSV file, and execute the malicious commands on their
  computer by opening the file using a software such as Microsoft Excel. The attacker could
  gain remote access to the user’s PC.
