aliases: []
summary: The Buzz Club – Night Club, DJ and Music Festival Event WordPress Theme theme for WordPress
  is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due
  to a missing capability check on the 'cmsmasters_hide_admin_notice' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to update option values to 'hide' on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged
  to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate
  users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.
