summary: rfc3161-client is a Python library implementing the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) described
  in RFC 3161. Prior to version 1.0.3, there is a flaw in the timestamp response signature verification
  logic. In particular, chain verification is performed against the TSR's embedded certificates
  up to the trusted root(s), but fails to verify the TSR's own signature against the timestamping
  leaf certificates. Consequently, vulnerable versions perform insufficient signature validation
  to properly consider a TSR verified, as the attacker can introduce any TSR signature so long
  as the embedded leaf chains up to some root TSA. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.3.
  There is no workaround for this issue.
