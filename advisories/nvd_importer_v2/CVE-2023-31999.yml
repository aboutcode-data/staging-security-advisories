aliases: []
summary: "All versions of @fastify/oauth2 used a statically generated state parameter at startup\
  \ time and were used across all requests for all users. The purpose of the Oauth2 state parameter\
  \ is to prevent Cross-Site-Request-Forgery attacks. As such, it should be unique per user\
  \ and should be connected to the user's session in some way that will allow the server to\
  \ validate it.\r\n\r\nv7.2.0 changes the default behavior to store the state in a cookie with\
  \ the http-only and same-site=lax attributes set. The state is now by default generated for\
  \ every user. Note that this contains a breaking change in the checkStateFunction function,\
  \ which now accepts the full Request object."
