summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked

  rq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:

  1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver

  2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked,
  such as bios ended from error handling code.

  Especially in bio_endio():

  1) request queue is referred via bio->bi_bdev->bd_disk->queue, which
  may be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above two
  cases

  2) q->rq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into
  __rq_qos_done_bio()

  Fix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops->done_bio if
  the bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio()
  and blkcg_iolatency_done_bio() are nop if the bio isn't tracked.
