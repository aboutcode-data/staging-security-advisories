aliases: []
summary: Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with Matrix. Prior to
  version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages
  appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield
  on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-ios-sdk
  implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy. The default policy for accepting key
  forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19. matrix-ios-sdk will
  now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own,
  verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption,
  based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients
  need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately
  (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). This attack requires coordination between
  a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need
  a workaround.
