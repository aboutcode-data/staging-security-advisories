aliases: []
summary: fast-xml-parser allows users to validate XML, parse XML to JS object, or build XML
  from JS object without C/C++ based libraries and no callback. From 4.1.3to before 5.3.5, a
  dot (.) in a DOCTYPE entity name is treated as a regex wildcard during entity replacement,
  allowing an attacker to shadow built-in XML entities (&lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &quot;, &apos;) with
  arbitrary values. This bypasses entity encoding and leads to XSS when parsed output is rendered.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 5.3.5.
