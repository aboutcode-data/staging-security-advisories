aliases: []
summary: URI.js is a javascript URL mutation library (npm package urijs). In URI.js before version
  1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character followed by an at
  (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect.
  Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses,
  SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\@observed-example.com`
  will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched versions
  correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers
  which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers and Node's built-in URL
  class. Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload variants. Version 1.19.3 has a
  partial patch but is still vulnerable to a payload variant.]
