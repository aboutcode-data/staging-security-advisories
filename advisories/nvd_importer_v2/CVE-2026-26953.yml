aliases: []
summary: Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level ad
  and internet tracker blocking application.  Versions 6.0 and above have a Stored HTML Injection
  vulnerability in the active sessions table located on the API settings page, allowing an attacker
  with valid credentials to inject arbitrary HTML code that will be rendered in the browser
  of any administrator who visits the active sessions page. The rowCallback function contains
  the value data.x_forwarded_for, which is directly concatenated into an HTML string and inserted
  into the DOM using jQuery’s .html() method. This method interprets the content as HTML, which
  means that any HTML tags present in the value will be parsed and rendered by the browser.
  An attacker can use common tools such as curl, wget, Python requests, Burp Suite, or even
  JavaScript fetch() to send an authentication request with an X-Forwarded-For header that contains
  malicious HTML code instead of a legitimate IP address. Since Pi-hole implements a Content
  Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline JavaScript, the impact is limited to pure HTML injection
  without the ability to execute scripts. This issue has been fixed in version 6.4.1.
