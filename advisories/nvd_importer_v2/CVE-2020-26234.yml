aliases: []
summary: Opencast before versions 8.9 and 7.9 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP
  client used for a large portion of Opencast's HTTP requests. Hostname verification is an important
  part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling
  it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.9 and Opencast
  8.8 Please be aware that fixing the problem means that Opencast will not simply accept any
  self-signed certificates any longer without properly importing them. If you need those, please
  make sure to import them into the Java key store. Better yet, get a valid certificate.
