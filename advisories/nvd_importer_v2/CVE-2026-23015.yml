  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gpio: mpsse: fix reference leak in gpio_mpsse_probe() error paths

  The reference obtained by calling usb_get_dev() is not released in the
  gpio_mpsse_probe() error paths. Fix that by using device managed helper
  functions. Also remove the usb_put_dev() call in the disconnect function
  since now it will be released automatically.
