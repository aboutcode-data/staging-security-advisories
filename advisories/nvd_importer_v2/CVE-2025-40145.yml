  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  PCI/pwrctrl: Fix double cleanup on devm_add_action_or_reset() failure

  When devm_add_action_or_reset() fails, it calls the passed cleanup
  function.  Hence the caller must not repeat that cleanup.

  Replace the "goto err_regulator_free" by the actual freeing, as there
  will never be a need again for a second user of this label.
