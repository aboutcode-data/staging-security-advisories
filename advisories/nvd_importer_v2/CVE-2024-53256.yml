aliases: []
summary: Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. `rizin.c`
  still had an old snippet of code which suffered a command injection due the usage of `rz_core_cmdf`
  to invoke the command `m` which was removed in v0.1.x. A malicious binary defining `bclass`
  (part of RzBinInfo) is executed if `rclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is set to `fs`; the vulnerability
  can be exploited by any bin format where `bclass` and `rclass` are user defined. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.7.4.
