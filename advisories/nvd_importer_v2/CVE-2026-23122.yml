summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  igc: Reduce TSN TX packet buffer from 7KB to 5KB per queue

  The previous 7 KB per queue caused TX unit hangs under heavy
  timestamping load. Reducing to 5 KB avoids these hangs and matches
  the TSN recommendation in I225/I226 SW User Manual Section 7.5.4.

  The 8 KB "freed" by this change is currently unused. This reduction
  is not expected to impact throughput, as the i226 is PCIe-limited
  for small TSN packets rather than TX-buffer-limited.
