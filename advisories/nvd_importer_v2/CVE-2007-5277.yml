aliases: []
summary: Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 drops DNS pins based on failed connections to irrelevant
  TCP ports, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks, as
  demonstrated by a port 81 URL in an IMG SRC, when the DNS pin had been established for a session
  on port 80, a different issue than CVE-2006-4560.
