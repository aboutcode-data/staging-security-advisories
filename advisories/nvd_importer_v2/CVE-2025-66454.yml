aliases: []
summary: Arcade MCP allows you to to create, deploy, and share MCP Servers. Prior to 1.5.4,
  the arcade-mcp HTTP server uses a hardcoded default worker secret ("dev") that is never validated
  or overridden during normal server startup. As a result, any unauthenticated attacker who
  knows this default key can forge valid JWTs and fully bypass the FastAPI authentication layer.
  This grants remote access to all worker endpoints—including tool enumeration and tool invocation—without
  credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.4.
