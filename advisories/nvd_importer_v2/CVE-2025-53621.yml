aliases: []
summary: DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access
  to digital resources. Two related XML External Entity (XXE) injection possibilities impact
  all versions of DSpace prior to 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. External entities are not disabled when
  parsing XML files during import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format), either from command-line
  (`./dspace import` command) or from the "Batch Import (Zip)" user interface feature. External
  entities are also not explicitly disabled when parsing XML responses from some upstream services
  (ArXiv, Crossref, OpenAIRE, Creative Commons) used in import from external sources via the
  user interface or REST API. An XXE injection in these files may result in a connection being
  made to an attacker's site or a local path readable by the Tomcat user, with content potentially
  being injected into a metadata field. In the latter case, this may result in sensitive content
  disclosure, including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace
  is running. The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by
  site administrators (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line).
  Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided
  by an attacker and trusted by an administrator, who would trigger the import. The fix is included
  in DSpace 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. Please upgrade to one of these versions. For those who cannot
  upgrade immediately, it is possible to manually patch the DSpace backend. One may also apply
  some best practices, though the protection provided is not as complete as upgrading. Administrators
  must carefully inspect any SAF archives (they did not construct themselves) before importing.
  As necessary, affected external services can be disabled to mitigate the ability for payloads
  to be delivered via external service APIs.
