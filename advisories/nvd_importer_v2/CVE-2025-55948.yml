aliases: []
summary: 'This vulnerability fundamentally arises from yzcheng90 X-SpringBoot 6.0''s implementation
  of role-based access control (RBAC) through dual dependency on frontend menu systems and backend
  permission tables, without enforcing atomic synchronization between these components. The
  critical flaw manifests when frontend menu updates (such as privilege revocation) fail to
  propagate to the backend permission table in real-time, creating a dangerous desynchronization.
  While users lose access to restricted functions through the web interface (as UI elements
  properly disappear), the stale permission records still validate unauthorized API requests
  when accessed directly through tools like Postman. Attackers exploiting this inconsistency
  can perform privileged operations including but not limited to: creating high-permission user
  accounts, accessing sensitive data beyond their clearance level, and executing admin-level
  commands.'
