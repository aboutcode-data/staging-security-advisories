aliases: []
summary: The Broken Link Notifier plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.3.0 via broken links that are later exported. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to embed
  untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files
  are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
