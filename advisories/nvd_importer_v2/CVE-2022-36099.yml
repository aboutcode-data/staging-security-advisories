summary: XWiki Platform Wiki UI Main Wiki is software for managing subwikis on XWiki Platform,
  a generic wiki platform. Starting with version 5.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.6
  and 14.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python and Velocity
  script macros via the request (URL parameter) using the `XWikiServerClassSheet` if the user
  has view access to this sheet and another page that has been saved with programming rights,
  a standard condition on a public read-only XWiki installation or a private XWiki installation
  where the user has an account. This allows arbitrary Groovy/Python/Velocity code execution
  which allows bypassing all rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all
  content stored in the XWiki installation. Also, this could be used to impact the availability
  of the wiki. This has been patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, edit the
  affected document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` or `WikiManager.XWikiServerClassSheet` and
  manually perform the changes from the patch fixing the issue. On XWiki versions 12.0 and later,
  it is also possible to import the document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` from the xwiki-platform-wiki-ui-mainwiki
  package version 14.4 using the import feature of the administration application as there have
  been no other changes to this document since XWiki 12.0.
