summary: WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to version 3.4.11, a remote
  code execution vulnerability was identified, caused by improper validation of uploaded files.
  The application allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary filenames, including those
  with a .php extension. Because the uploaded file is written directly to disk without adequate
  sanitization or extension restrictions, a spreadsheet file followed by PHP code can be uploaded
  and executed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is due to insufficient
  mitigation of CVE-2025-22133. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.11.
