summary: 'Apache Karaf obr:* commands and run goal on the karaf-maven-plugin have partial path
  traversal which allows to break out of expected folder. The risk is low as obr:* commands
  are not very used and the entry is set by user. This has been fixed in revision: https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=36a2bc4
  https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=52b70cf Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should
  upgrade to 4.2.15 or 4.3.6 or later as soon as possible, or use correct path. JIRA Tickets:
