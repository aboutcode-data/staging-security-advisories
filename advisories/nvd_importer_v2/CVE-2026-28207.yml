summary: Zen C is a systems programming language that compiles to human-readable GNU C/C11.
  Prior to version 0.4.2, a command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) in the Zen C compiler allows
  local attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands by providing a specially crafted output
  filename via the `-o` command-line argument. The vulnerability existed in the `main` application
  logic (specifically in `src/main.c`), where the compiler constructed a shell command string
  to invoke the backend C compiler. This command string was built by concatenating various arguments,
  including the user-controlled output filename, and was subsequently executed using the `system()`
  function. Because `system()` invokes a shell to parse and execute the command, shell metacharacters
  within the output filename were interpreted by the shell, leading to arbitrary command execution.
  An attacker who can influence the command-line arguments passed to the `zc` compiler (like
  through a build script or a CI/CD pipeline configuration) can execute arbitrary commands with
  the privileges of the user running the compiler. The vulnerability has been fixed in version
  0.4.2 by removing `system()` calls, implementing `ArgList`, and internal argument handling.
  Users are advised to update to Zen C version v0.4.2 or later.
