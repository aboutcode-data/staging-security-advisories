  usbnet: ipheth: use static NDP16 location in URB

  Original code allowed for the start of NDP16 to be anywhere within the
  URB based on the `wNdpIndex` value in NTH16. Only the start position of
  NDP16 was checked, so it was possible for even the fixed-length part
  of NDP16 to extend past the end of URB, leading to an out-of-bounds
  read.

  On iOS devices, the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on
  and check for this specific format.

  This, along with NCM-specific minimal URB length check that already
  exists, will ensure that the fixed-length part of NDP16 plus a set
  amount of DPEs fit within the URB.

  Note that this commit alone does not fully address the OoB read.
  The limit on the amount of DPEs needs to be enforced separately.
