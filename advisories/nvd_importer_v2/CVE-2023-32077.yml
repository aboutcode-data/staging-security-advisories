aliases: []
summary: Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. Prior to versions 0.17.1 and 0.18.6, hardcoded
  DNS key usage has been found in Netmaker allowing unauth users to interact with DNS API endpoints.
  The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6.  If users are using 0.17.1, they should
  run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them
  to the patched users. If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or
  later. As a workaround, someone who is using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image
  of the backend and restart the server.
