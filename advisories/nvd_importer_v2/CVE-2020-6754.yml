aliases: []
summary: dotCMS before 5.2.4 is vulnerable to directory traversal, leading to incorrect access
  control. It allows an attacker to read or execute files under $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT/assets
  (which should be a protected directory). Additionally, attackers can upload temporary files
  (e.g., .jsp files) into /webapps/ROOT/assets/tmp_upload, which can lead to remote command
  execution (with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application).
