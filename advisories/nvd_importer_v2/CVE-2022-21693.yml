aliases: []
summary: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files,
  host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions an adversary
  with a primitive that allows for filesystem access from the context of the Onionshare process
  can access sensitive files in the entire user home folder. This could lead to the leaking
  of sensitive data. Due to the automatic exclusion of hidden folders, the impact is reduced.
  This can be mitigated by usage of the flatpak release.
