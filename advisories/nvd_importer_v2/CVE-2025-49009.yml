aliases: []
summary: Para is a multitenant backend server/framework for object persistence and retrieval.
  A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.50.8 in `FacebookAuthFilter.java` results
  in a full request URL being logged during a failed request to a Facebook user profile. The
  log includes the user's access token in plain text. Since WARN-level logs are often retained
  in production and accessible to operators or log aggregation systems, this poses a risk of
  token exposure. Version 1.50.8 fixes the issue.
