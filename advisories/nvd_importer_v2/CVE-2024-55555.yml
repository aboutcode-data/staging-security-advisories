aliases: []
summary: Invoice Ninja before 5.10.43 allows remote code execution from a pre-authenticated
  route when an attacker knows the APP_KEY. This is exacerbated by .env files, available from
  the product's repository, that have default APP_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined
  in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter
  {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing
  a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger
  remote command execution from arbitrary deserialization.) Therefore, an attacker in possession
  of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function.
