  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: hyperv: streamline driver probe to avoid devres issues

  It was found that unloading 'hid_hyperv' module results in a devres
  complaint:

   ...
   hv_vmbus: unregistering driver hid_hyperv
   ------------[ cut here ]------------
   WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3983 at drivers/base/devres.c:691 devres_release_group+0x1f2/0x2c0

  And the issue seems to be that the corresponding devres group is not
  allocated. Normally, devres_open_group() is called from
  __hid_device_probe() but Hyper-V HID driver overrides 'hid_dev->driver'
  with 'mousevsc_hid_driver' stub and basically re-implements
  __hid_device_probe() by calling hid_parse() and hid_hw_start() but not
  devres_open_group(). hid_device_probe() does not call __hid_device_probe()
  for it. Later, when the driver is removed, hid_device_remove() calls
  devres_release_group() as it doesn't check whether hdev->driver was
  initially overridden or not.

  The issue seems to be related to the commit 62c68e7cee33 ("HID: ensure
  timely release of driver-allocated resources") but the commit itself seems
  to be correct.

  Fix the issue by dropping the 'hid_dev->driver' override and using
  hid_register_driver()/hid_unregister_driver() instead. Alternatively, it
  would have been possible to rely on the default handling but
  HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT implies HID_CONNECT_HIDRAW and it doesn't seem to work
  for mousevsc as-is.
