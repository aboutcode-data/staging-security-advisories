summary: "Amin Aliakbari, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found a broken access\
  \ control which would lead to less-privileged operator- and/or viewer accounts having more\
  \ privileges than designed. The risk of exploitation is very low as it requires complex steps\
  \ to execute, including knowing of account passwords and social engineering attacks in tricking\
  \ the administrator to perform specific configurations on operator- and/or viewer-privileged\
  \ accounts. \nAxis has released patched AXIS OS a version for the highlighted flaw. Please\
  \ refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution."
