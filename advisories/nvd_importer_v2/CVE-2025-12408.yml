summary: The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.2.2 via the 'get_location'
  action due to insufficient restrictions on which locations can be included. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract data from password protected, private, or
  draft event locations that they should not have access to.
