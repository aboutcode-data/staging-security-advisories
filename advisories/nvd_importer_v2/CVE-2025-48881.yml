aliases: []
summary: Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE
  to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE, all objects for which an object-management
  configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users.
  If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed
  independent of object-management configurations. This issue has been patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.  A
  workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer
  and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result
  in loss of functionality.
