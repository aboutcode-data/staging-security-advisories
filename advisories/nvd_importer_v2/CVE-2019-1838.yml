aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure
  Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management
  interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface
  to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
  This vulnerability has been fixed in software version 14.1(1i).
