summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  lib/buildid: use __kernel_read() for sleepable context

  Prevent a "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference in
  filemap_read_folio".

  For the sleepable context, convert freader to use __kernel_read() instead
  of direct page cache access via read_cache_folio().  This simplifies the
  faultable code path by using the standard kernel file reading interface
  which handles all the complexity of reading file data.

  At the moment we are not changing the code for non-sleepable context which
  uses filemap_get_folio() and only succeeds if the target folios are
  already in memory and up-to-date.  The reason is to keep the patch simple
  and easier to backport to stable kernels.

  Syzbot repro does not crash the kernel anymore and the selftests run
  successfully.

  In the follow up we will make __kernel_read() with IOCB_NOWAIT work for
  non-sleepable contexts.  In addition, I would like to replace the
  secretmem check with a more generic approach and will add fstest for the
  buildid code.
