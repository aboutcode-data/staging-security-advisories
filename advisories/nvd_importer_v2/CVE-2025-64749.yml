aliases: []
summary: 'Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. An
  observable difference in error messaging was found in the Directus REST API in versions of
  Directus prior to version 11.13.0. The `/items/{collection}` API returns different error messages
  for two cases: when a user tries to access an existing collection which they are not authorized
  to access, and when user tries to access a non-existing collection. The two differing error
  messages leak the existence of collections to users which are not authorized to access these
  collections. Version 11.13.0 fixes the issue.'
