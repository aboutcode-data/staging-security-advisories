summary: The Cuba JPA web API enables loading and saving any entities defined in the application
  data model by sending simple HTTP requests. Prior to version 1.1.1, the input parameter, which
  consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with
  text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to
  be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded
  beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1. A workaround is provided on the
  Jmix documentation website.
