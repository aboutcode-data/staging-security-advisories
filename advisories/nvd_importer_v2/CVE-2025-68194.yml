  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: imon: make send_packet() more robust

  syzbot is reporting that imon has three problems which result in
  hung tasks due to forever holding device lock [1].

  First problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error
  after ictx->dev_present_intf0 became true, usb_rx_callback_intf0()
  resubmits urb after printk(), and resubmitted urb causes
  usb_rx_callback_intf0() to again get -EPROTO error. This results in
  printk() flooding (RCU stalls).

  Alan Stern commented [2] that

    In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust
    error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the
    number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a
    time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to
    do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more
    vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in
    reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong
    with giving up right away.

  but imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;
  this behavior should be fixed.

  Since I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any
  error code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from
  modules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.
  ir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).

  Second problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error
  before ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always
  resubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf ("[media] imon: don't wedge
  hardware after early callbacks"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test
  introduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a ("[media] imon: don't parse scancodes
  until intf configured") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or
  the first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.
  hung task).

  Third problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some
  reason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes
  prevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),
  wait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.
  hung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to
  wait for completion with timeout of 10 seconds.
