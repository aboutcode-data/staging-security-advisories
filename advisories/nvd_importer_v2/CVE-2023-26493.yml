summary: Cocos Engine is an open-source framework for building 2D & 3D real-time rendering and
  interactive content. In the github repo for Cocos Engine the `web-interface-check.yml` was
  subject to command injection. The `web-interface-check.yml` was triggered when a pull request
  was opened or updated and contained the user controllable field `(${{ github.head_ref }} –
  the name of the fork’s branch)`. This would allow an attacker to take over the GitHub Runner
  and run custom commands (potentially stealing secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN) and altering the
  repository. The workflow has since been removed for the repository. There are no actions required
  of users.
