aliases: []
summary: The POST SMTP Mailer WordPress plugin before 2.5.7 does not have proper CSRF checks
  in some AJAX actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in users with the manage_postman_smtp
  capability resend an email to an arbitrary address (for example a password reset email could
  be resent to an attacker controlled email, and allow them to take over an account).
