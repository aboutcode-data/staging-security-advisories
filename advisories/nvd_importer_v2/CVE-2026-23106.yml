summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  timekeeping: Adjust the leap state for the correct auxiliary timekeeper

  When __do_ajdtimex() was introduced to handle adjtimex for any
  timekeeper, this reference to tk_core was not updated. When called on an
  auxiliary timekeeper, the core timekeeper would be updated incorrectly.

  This gets caught by the lock debugging diagnostics because the
  timekeepers sequence lock gets written to without holding its
  associated spinlock:

  WARNING: include/linux/seqlock.h:226 at __do_adjtimex+0x394/0x3b0, CPU#2: test/125
  aux_clock_adj (kernel/time/timekeeping.c:2979)

  Update the correct auxiliary timekeeper.
