summary: "For a brief summary of Xapi terminology, see:\n\n   https://xapi-project.github.io/xen-api/overview.html#object-model-overview\
  \ \n\nXapi contains functionality to backup and restore metadata about Virtual\nMachines and\
  \ Storage Repositories (SRs).\n\nThe metadata itself is stored in a Virtual Disk Image (VDI)\
  \ inside an\nSR.  This is used for two purposes; a general backup of metadata\n(e.g. to recover\
  \ from a host failure if the filer is still good), and\nPortable SRs (e.g. using an external\
  \ hard drive to move VMs to another\nhost).\n\nMetadata is only restored as an explicit administrator\
  \ action, but\noccurs in cases where the host has no information about the SR, and must\n\
  locate the metadata VDI in order to retrieve the metadata.\n\nThe metadata VDI is located\
  \ by searching (in UUID alphanumeric order)\neach VDI, mounting it, and seeing if there is\
  \ a suitable metadata file\npresent.  The first matching VDI is deemed to be the metadata\
  \ VDI, and\nis restored from.\n\nIn the general case, the content of VDIs are controlled by\
  \ the VM owner,\nand should not be trusted by the host administrator.\n\nA malicious guest\
  \ can manipulate its disk to appear to be a metadata\nbackup.\n\nA guest cannot choose the\
  \ UUIDs of its VDIs, but a guest with one disk\nhas a 50% chance of sorting ahead of the legitimate\
  \ metadata backup.  A\nguest with two disks has a 75% chance, etc."
