summary: "A vulnerability in the text rendering subsystem of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration\
  \ Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis\
  \ vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of input received by an affected device.\
  \ An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by getting the affected device to render crafted\
  \ text, for example, a crafted meeting invitation. As indicated in the CVSS score, no user\
  \ interaction is required, such as accepting the meeting invitation. A successful exploit\
  \ could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
