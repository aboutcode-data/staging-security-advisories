aliases: []
summary: SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java allows an attacker to access an endpoint that
  can disclose information about deployed server components, including their XML definitions.
  This information should ideally be restricted to customer administrators, even though they
  may not need it. These XML files are not entirely SAP-internal as they are deployed with the
  server. In such a scenario, sensitive information could be exposed without compromising its
  integrity or availability.
