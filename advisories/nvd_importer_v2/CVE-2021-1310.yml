aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Webex Meetings could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to an untrusted web page, bypassing
  the warning mechanism that should prompt the user before the redirection. This vulnerability
  is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website, bypassing the
  Webex URL check that should result in a warning before the redirection to the web page. Attackers
  may use this type of vulnerability, known as an open redirect attack, as part of a phishing
  attack to convince users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.
