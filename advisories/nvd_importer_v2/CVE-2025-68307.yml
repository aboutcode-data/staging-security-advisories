aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: gs_usb: gs_usb_xmit_callback(): fix handling of failed transmitted URBs

  The driver lacks the cleanup of failed transfers of URBs. This reduces the
  number of available URBs per error by 1. This leads to reduced performance
  and ultimately to a complete stop of the transmission.

  If the sending of a bulk URB fails do proper cleanup:
  - increase netdev stats
  - mark the echo_sbk as free
  - free the driver's context and do accounting
  - wake the send queue
