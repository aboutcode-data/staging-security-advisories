aliases: []
summary: The Weave server API allows remote users to fetch files from a specific directory,
  but due to a lack of input validation, it is possible to traverse and leak arbitrary files
  remotely. In various common scenarios, this allows a low-privileged user to assume the role
  of the server admin.
