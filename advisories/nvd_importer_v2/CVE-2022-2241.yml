summary: The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) WordPress plugin before 4.0.1 does not have CSRF
  check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in
  admin change them via a CSRF attack. Furthermore, due to the lack of validation, sanitisation
  and escaping in some of them, it could also lead to Stored XSS issues
