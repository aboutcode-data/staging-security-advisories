aliases: []
summary: snowflake-connector-net is the Snowflake Connector for .NET. Versions starting from
  2.1.2 to before 4.4.1, are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
  When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS, the Connector reads logging configuration
  from a user-provided file. On Linux and macOS, the Connector verifies that the configuration
  file can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition
  and failed to verify that the file owner matches the user running the Connector. This could
  allow a local attacker with write access to the configuration file or the directory containing
  it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location.
  This issue has been patched in version 4.4.1.
