summary: 'A vulnerability in the routine that loads DLL files in Cisco Meeting App for Windows
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run an executable file with privileges equivalent
  to those of Cisco Meeting App. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of
  the path name for DLL files before they are loaded. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by installing a crafted DLL file in a specific system directory. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges
  equivalent to those of Cisco Meeting App. The attacker would need valid user credentials to
  exploit this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd77907.'
