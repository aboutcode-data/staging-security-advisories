  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query

  The ethtool -S command operates across three ioctl calls:
  ETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO for the size, ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS for the names, and
  ETHTOOL_GSTATS for the values.

  If the number of stats changes between these calls (e.g., due to device
  reconfiguration), userspace's buffer allocation will be incorrect,
  potentially leading to buffer overflow.

  Drivers are generally expected to maintain stable stat counts, but some
  drivers (e.g., mlx5, bnx2x, bna, ksz884x) use dynamic counters, making
  this scenario possible.

  Some drivers try to handle this internally:
  - bnad_get_ethtool_stats() returns early in case stats.n_stats is not
    equal to the driver's stats count.
  - micrel/ksz884x also makes sure not to write anything beyond
    stats.n_stats and overflow the buffer.

  However, both use stats.n_stats which is already assigned with the value
  returned from get_sset_count(), hence won't solve the issue described
  here.

  Change ethtool_get_strings(), ethtool_get_stats(),
  ethtool_get_phy_stats() to not return anything in case of a mismatch
  between userspace's size and get_sset_size(), to prevent buffer
  overflow.
  The returned n_stats value will be equal to zero, to reflect that
  nothing has been returned.

  This could result in one of two cases when using upstream ethtool,
  depending on when the size change is detected:
  1. When detected in ethtool_get_strings():
      # ethtool -S eth2
      no stats available

  2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.

  Both cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call
  should succeed.

  Other than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no
  output/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting
  incorrect/shifted stats.
  I also considered returning an error instead of a "silent" response, but
  that seems more destructive towards userspace apps.

  Notes:
  - This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure
    that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more
    predictable behavior.

  - RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between
    the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.

  - Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that
    these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications
    which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,
    to prevent any regressions.
