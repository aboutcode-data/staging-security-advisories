aliases: []
summary: The mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to file uploads due to a missing
  capability check in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
  will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file or upload arbitrary EXE files on the affected
  site's server which may make remote code execution possible if the attacker can also gain
  access to run the .exe file, or trick a site visitor into downloading and running the .exe
  file.
