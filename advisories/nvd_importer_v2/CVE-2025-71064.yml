  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: hns3: using the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources

  Currently, hdev->htqp is allocated using hdev->num_tqps, and kinfo->tqp
  is allocated using kinfo->num_tqps. However, kinfo->num_tqps is set to
  min(new_tqps, hdev->num_tqps);  Therefore, kinfo->num_tqps may be smaller
  than hdev->num_tqps, which causes some hdev->htqp[i] to remain
  uninitialized in hclgevf_knic_setup().

  Thus, this patch allocates hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp using hdev->num_tqps,
  ensuring that the lengths of hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp are consistent
  and that all elements are properly initialized.
