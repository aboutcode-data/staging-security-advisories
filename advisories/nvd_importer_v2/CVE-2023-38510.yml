aliases: []
summary: Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. Starting in version 3.14.0 and prior
  to version 3.23.1, when a request is made using an API key, the backend fails to verify the
  permission scopes associated with the key, effectively bypassing permission checks entirely
  for some endpoints. It's important to note that this vulnerability only affects projects that
  have inadvertently exposed their API keys on the internet. Projects that have kept their API
  keys secure are not impacted. This issue is fixed in version 3.23.1.
