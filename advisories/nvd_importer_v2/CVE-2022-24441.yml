aliases: []
summary: 'The package snyk before 1.1064.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection when analyzing a
  project. An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project can include commands
  in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the
  privileges of the application. This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI
  tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI.
  Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering
  - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened
  in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a
  Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as ‘trusted’ in order to be vulnerable.
  **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342),
  and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well. The affected IDE plugins
  and versions are: - VS Code - Affected: <=1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0 - IntelliJ - Affected: <=2.4.47,
  Fixed: 2.4.48 - Visual Studio - Affected: <=1.1.30, Fixed: 1.1.31 - Eclipse - Affected: <=v20221115.132308,
  Fixed: All subsequent versions - Language Server - Affected: <=v20221109.114426, Fixed: All
  subsequent versions'
