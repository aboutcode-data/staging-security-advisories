aliases: []
summary: A critical stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Analytics
  component of lunary-ai/lunary versions up to 1.9.23, where the NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOM_SCRIPT environment
  variable is directly injected into the DOM using dangerouslySetInnerHTML without any sanitization
  or validation. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in all users' browsers if an attacker
  can control the environment variable during deployment or through server compromise. The vulnerability
  can lead to complete account takeover, data exfiltration, malware distribution, and persistent
  attacks affecting all users until the environment variable is cleaned. The issue is fixed
  in version 1.9.25.
