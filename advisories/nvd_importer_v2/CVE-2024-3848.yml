aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.11.0, identified as
  a bypass for the previously addressed CVE-2023-6909. The vulnerability arises from the application's
  handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment,
  effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed,
  ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result,
  an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud
  keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue
  stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary
  file read through path traversal.
