aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui allows for arbitrary file upload and read
  due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the issue resides in
  the `install_model()` function within `lollms_core/lollms/binding.py`, where the application
  fails to properly sanitize the `file://` protocol and other inputs, leading to arbitrary read
  and upload capabilities. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `path`
  and `variant_name` parameters to achieve path traversal, allowing for the reading of arbitrary
  files and uploading files to arbitrary locations on the server. This vulnerability affects
  the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui.
