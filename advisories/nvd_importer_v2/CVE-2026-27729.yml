aliases: []
summary: 'Astro is a web framework. In versions 9.0.0 through 9.5.3, Astro server actions have
  no default request body size limit, which can lead to memory exhaustion DoS. A single large
  POST to a valid action endpoint can crash the server process on memory-constrained deployments.
  On-demand rendered sites built with Astro can define server actions, which automatically parse
  incoming request bodies (JSON or FormData). The body is buffered entirely into memory with
  no size limit — a single oversized request is sufficient to exhaust the process heap and crash
  the server. Astro''s Node adapter (`mode: ''standalone''`) creates an HTTP server with no
  body size protection. In containerized environments, the crashed process is automatically
  restarted, and repeated requests cause a persistent crash-restart loop. Action names are discoverable
  from HTML form attributes on any public page, so no authentication is required. The vulnerability
  allows unauthenticated denial of service against SSR standalone deployments using server actions.
  A single oversized request crashes the server process, and repeated requests cause a persistent
  crash-restart loop in containerized environments. Version 9.5.4 contains a fix.'
