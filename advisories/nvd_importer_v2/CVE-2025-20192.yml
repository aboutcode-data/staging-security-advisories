summary: "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation of Cisco\
  \ IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service\
  \ (DoS) condition. The attacker must have valid IKEv1 VPN credentials to exploit this vulnerability.\r\
  \n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of IKEv1 phase 2 parameters before the\
  \ IPsec security association creation request is handed off to the hardware cryptographic\
  \ accelerator of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\
  \ crafted IKEv1 messages to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to cause the device to reload."
