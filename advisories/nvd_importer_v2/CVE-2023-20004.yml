summary: "Three vulnerabilities in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an\
  \ authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system of an\
  \ affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to improper access controls on files\
  \ that are on the local file system. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by placing\
  \ a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A\
  \ successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected\
  \ device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have a remote support\
  \ user account.\r\nNote: CVE-2023-20092 does not affect Cisco DX70, DX80, TelePresence MX\
  \ Series, or TelePresence SX Series devices.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address\
  \ these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities."
