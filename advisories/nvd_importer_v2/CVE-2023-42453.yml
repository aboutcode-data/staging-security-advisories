aliases: []
summary: Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org
  Foundation. Users were able to forge read receipts for any event (if they knew the room ID
  and event ID). Note that the users were not able to view the events, but simply mark it as
  read. This could be confusing as clients will show the event as read by the user, even if
  they are not in the room. This issue has been patched in version 1.93.0. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
