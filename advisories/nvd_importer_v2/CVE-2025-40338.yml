  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: Intel: avs: Do not share the name pointer between components

  By sharing 'name' directly, tearing down components may lead to
  use-after-free errors. Duplicate the name to avoid that.

  At the same time, update the order of operations - since commit
  cee28113db17 ("ASoC: dmaengine_pcm: Allow passing component name via
  config") the framework does not override component->name if set before
  invoking the initializer.
