aliases: []
summary: The Unlimited Addons for WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'importZipFile' function
  in versions up to, and including, 1.0.42. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
  with a role that the administrator previously granted access to the plugin (the default is
  editor role, but access can also be granted to contributor role), to upload arbitrary files
  on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
