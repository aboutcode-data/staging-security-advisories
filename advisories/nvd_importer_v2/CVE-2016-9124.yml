aliases: []
summary: Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication
  Attempts. The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An
  account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions
  to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been introduced as a countermeasure
  in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These
  systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack
  is in progress.
