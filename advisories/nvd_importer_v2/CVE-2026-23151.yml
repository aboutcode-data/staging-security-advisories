  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete

  Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete() where mgmt_pending_cmd structures
  are not freed after being removed from the pending list.

  Commit 302a1f674c00 ("Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix possible UAFs") replaced
  mgmt_pending_foreach() calls with individual command handling but missed
  adding mgmt_pending_free() calls in both error and success paths of
  set_ssp_complete(). Other completion functions like set_le_complete()
  were fixed correctly in the same commit.

  This causes a memory leak of the mgmt_pending_cmd structure and its
  associated parameter data for each SSP command that completes.

  Add the missing mgmt_pending_free(cmd) calls in both code paths to fix
  the memory leak. Also fix the same issue in set_advertising_complete().
