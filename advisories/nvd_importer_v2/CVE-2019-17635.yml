aliases: []
summary: Eclipse Memory Analyzer version 1.9.1 and earlier is subject to a deserialization vulnerability
  if an index file of a parsed heap dump is replaced by a malicious version and the heap dump
  is reopened in Memory Analyzer. The user must chose to reopen an already parsed heap dump
  with an untrusted index for the problem to occur. The problem can be averted if the index
  files from an untrusted source are deleted and the heap dump is opened and reparsed. Also
  some local configuration data is subject to a deserialization vulnerability if the local data
  were to be replaced with a malicious version. This can be averted if the local configuration
  data stored on the file system cannot be changed by an attacker. The vulnerability could possibly
  allow code execution on the local system.
