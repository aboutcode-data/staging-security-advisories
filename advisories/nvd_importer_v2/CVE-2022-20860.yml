aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS implementation of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to alter communications with associated controllers or
  view sensitive information. This vulnerability exists because SSL server certificates are
  not validated when Cisco Nexus Dashboard is establishing a connection to Cisco Application
  Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), Cisco Cloud APIC, or Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric
  Controller, formerly Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) controllers. An attacker could exploit
  this vulnerability by using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between
  the affected device and the controllers, and then using a crafted certificate to impersonate
  the controllers. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter communications between
  devices or view sensitive information, including Administrator credentials for these controllers.
