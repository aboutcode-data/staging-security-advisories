aliases: []
summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized application orchestration
  capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore
  Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler.
  An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with
  a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a
  request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read
  into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service.
  Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when
  users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed
  in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config
  file `cloudcore.yaml`.
