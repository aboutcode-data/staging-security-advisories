summary: The WP STAGING and WP STAGING Pro plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Sensitive
  Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 3.4.3, and versions up to, and including,
  5.4.3, respectively, via the ajaxSendReport function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to extract sensitive data from a log file, including system information and (in
  the Pro version) license keys. Successful exploitation requires an administrator to have used
  the 'Contact Us' functionality along with the "Enable this option to automatically submit
  the log files." option.
