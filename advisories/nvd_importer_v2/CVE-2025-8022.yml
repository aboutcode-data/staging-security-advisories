summary: 'Rejected reason: Bun Shell does not invoke /bin/sh, or any other interpreter, for
  template literals created with the $ function. Each ${…} interpolation is treated as a single
  argument. The security responsibility for this usage pattern lies with the calling application,
  which must ensure the sanitization and validation of any untrusted arguments before passing
  them to the executed commands. Therefore, the potential for command injection is not a flaw
  within Bun itself; rather, it is an argument injection that is contingent on its implementation
  by the consuming application.'
