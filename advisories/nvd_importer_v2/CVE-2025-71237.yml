  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nilfs2: Fix potential block overflow that cause system hang

  When a user executes the FITRIM command, an underflow can occur when
  calculating nblocks if end_block is too small. Since nblocks is of
  type sector_t, which is u64, a negative nblocks value will become a
  very large positive integer. This ultimately leads to the block layer
  function __blkdev_issue_discard() taking an excessively long time to
  process the bio chain, and the ns_segctor_sem lock remains held for a
  long period. This prevents other tasks from acquiring the ns_segctor_sem
  lock, resulting in the hang reported by syzbot in [1].

  If the ending block is too small, typically if it is smaller than 4KiB
  range, depending on the usage of the segment 0, it may be possible to
  attempt a discard request beyond the device size causing the hang.

  Exiting successfully and assign the discarded size (0 in this case)
  to range->len.

  Although the start and len values in the user input range are too small,
  a conservative strategy is adopted here to safely ignore them, which is
  equivalent to a no-op; it will not perform any trimming and will not
  throw an error.
