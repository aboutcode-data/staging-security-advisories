summary: The Restrict User Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce

  to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
