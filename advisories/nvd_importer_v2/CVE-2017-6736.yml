summary: "The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\
  \ contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to\
  \ remotely execute code on an affected system or cause an affected system to reload. An attacker\
  \ could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected system\
  \ via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to an affected system can be used to exploit these\
  \ vulnerabilities.\r\n\r The vulnerabilities are due to a buffer overflow condition in the\
  \ SNMP subsystem of the affected software. The vulnerabilities affect all versions of SNMP\
  \ - Versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 2c or earlier,\
  \ the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. To exploit\
  \ these vulnerabilities via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the\
  \ affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code\
  \ and obtain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload.\r\
  \n\r Customers are advised to apply the workaround as contained in the Workarounds section\
  \ below. Fixed software information is available via the Cisco IOS Software Checker. All devices\
  \ that have enabled SNMP and have not explicitly excluded the affected MIBs or OIDs should\
  \ be considered vulnerable.\r\n\r   There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities."
