aliases: []
summary: SilverwareGames.io is a social network for users to play video games online. In version
  1.1.8 and prior, due to an unobvious feature of PHP, hashes generated by built-in functions
  and starting with the `0e` symbols were being handled as zero multiplied with the `e` number.
  Therefore, the hash value was equal to 0. The maintainers fixed this in version 1.1.9 by using
  `===` instead of `==` in comparisons where it is possible (e.g. on sign in/sign up handlers).
