summary: Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to versions
  5.73.11 and 6.4.0, when Glide image manipulation is used in insecure mode (which is not the
  default), the image proxy can be abused by an unauthenticated user to make the server send
  HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs—either via the URL directly or via the watermark feature.
  That can allow access to internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, and other hosts reachable
  from the server. This has been fixed in 5.73.11 and 6.4.0.
