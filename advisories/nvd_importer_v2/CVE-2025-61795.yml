aliases: []
summary: "Improper Resource Shutdown or Release vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nIf an error\
  \ occurred (including exceeding limits) during the processing of a multipart upload, temporary\
  \ copies of the uploaded parts written to disc were not cleaned up immediately but left for\
  \ the garbage collection process to delete. Depending on JVM settings, application memory\
  \ usage and application load, it was possible that space for the temporary copies of uploaded\
  \ parts would be filled faster than GC cleared it, leading to a DoS.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects\
  \ Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.46, from 9.0.0.M1\
  \ through 9.0.109.\n\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but\
  \ are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be\
  \ affected.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.12 or later, 10.1.47 or later\
  \ or 9.0.110 or later which fixes the issue."
