aliases: []
summary: SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious
  scripts into a URL parameter. The scripts are reflected in the server response and executed
  in a user's browser when the crafted URL is visited, leading to theft of session information,
  manipulation of portal content, or user redirection, resulting in a low impact on the application's
  confidentiality and integrity, with no impact on availability.
