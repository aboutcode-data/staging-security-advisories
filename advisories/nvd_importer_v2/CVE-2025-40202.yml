summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ipmi: Rework user message limit handling

  The limit on the number of user messages had a number of issues,
  improper counting in some cases and a use after free.

  Restructure how this is all done to handle more in the receive message
  allocation routine, so all refcouting and user message limit counts
  are done in that routine.  It's a lot cleaner and safer.
