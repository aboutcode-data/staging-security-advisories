aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms, specifically in the `/unInstall_binding` endpoint,
  allows for arbitrary code execution due to insufficient sanitization of user input. The issue
  arises from the lack of path sanitization when handling the `name` parameter in the `unInstall_binding`
  function, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and execute arbitrary code by loading
  a malicious `__init__.py` file. This vulnerability affects the latest version of the software.
  The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution on the system where
  parisneo/lollms is deployed.
