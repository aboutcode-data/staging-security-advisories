summary: Clevo’s UEFI firmware update packages, including B10717.exe, inadvertently contained
  private signing keys used for Boot Guard and Boot Policy Manifest verification. The exposure
  of these keys could allow attackers to sign malicious firmware that appears trusted by affected
  systems, undermining the integrity of the early boot process.
