summary: The Auto Thumbnailer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in the uploadThumb() function in all versions up to, and including,

  above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code
  execution possible.
