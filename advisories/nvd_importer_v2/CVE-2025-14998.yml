aliases: []
summary: The Branda plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.24. This is due to the plugin not properly validating
  a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that
  to gain access to their account.
