aliases: []
summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based threading that combines
  email and chat. Users who used to be subscribed to a private stream and have been removed
  from it since retain the ability to edit messages/topics, move messages to other streams,
  and delete messages that they used to have access to, if other relevant organization permissions
  allow these actions. For example, a user may be able to edit or delete their old messages
  they posted in such a private stream. An administrator will be able to delete old messages
  (that they had access to) from the private stream. This issue was fixed in Zulip Server version
  7.3.
