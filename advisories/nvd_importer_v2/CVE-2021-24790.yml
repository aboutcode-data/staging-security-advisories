aliases: []
summary: The Contact Form Advanced Database WordPress plugin through 1.0.8 does not have any
  authorisation as well as CSRF checks in its delete_cf7_data and export_cf7_data AJAX actions,
  available to any authenticated users, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber
  to call them. The delete_cf7_data would lead to arbitrary metadata deletion, as well as PHP
  Object Injection if a suitable gadget chain is present in another plugin, as user data is
  passed to the maybe_unserialize() function without being first validated.
