aliases: []
summary: 'HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor.
  An attacker can read arbitrary `.md` files from the server''s filesystem due to an improper
  input validation, which results in the ability to perform a relative path traversal. To verify
  if you are affected, you can try to open the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/..%2F..%2FREADME#`
  (replace `http://localhost:3000` with your instance''s base-URL e.g. `https://demo.hedgedoc.org/..%2F..%2FREADME#`).
  If you see a README page being rendered, you run an affected version. The attack works due
  the fact that the internal router passes the url-encoded alias to the `noteController.showNote`-function.
  This function passes the input directly to findNote() utility function, that will pass it
  on the the parseNoteId()-function, that tries to make sense out of the noteId/alias and check
  if a note already exists and if so, if a corresponding file on disk was updated. If no note
  exists the note creation-function is called, which pass this unvalidated alias, with a `.md`
  appended, into a path.join()-function which is read from the filesystem in the follow up routine
  and provides the pre-filled content of the new note. This allows an attacker to not only read
  arbitrary `.md` files from the filesystem, but also observes changes to them. The usefulness
  of this attack can be considered limited, since mainly markdown files are use the file-ending
  `.md` and all markdown files contained in the hedgedoc project, like the README, are public
  anyway. If other protections such as a chroot or container or proper file permissions are
  in place, this attack''s usefulness is rather limited. On a reverse-proxy level one can force
  a URL-decode, which will prevent this attack because the router will not accept such a path.'
