aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of
  data privacy requests in runtime environments, and the enforcement of privacy regulations
  in code. The Fides web application allows a custom integration to be uploaded as a ZIP file
  containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format. It was discovered that specially
  crafted YAML dataset and config files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary requests
  to internal systems and exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as a Server-Side
  Request Forgery). The application does not perform proper validation to block attempts to
  connect to internal (including localhost) resources. The vulnerability has been patched in
  Fides version `2.22.1`.
