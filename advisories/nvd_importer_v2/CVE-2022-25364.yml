aliases: []
summary: In Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.2, the default built-in build cache configuration
  allowed anonymous write access. If this was not manually changed, a malicious actor with network
  access to the build cache could potentially populate it with manipulated entries that execute
  malicious code as part of a build. As of 2021.4.2, the built-in build cache is inaccessible-by-default,
  requiring explicit configuration of its access-control settings before it can be used. (Remote
  build cache nodes are unaffected as they are inaccessible-by-default.)
