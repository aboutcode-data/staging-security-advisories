aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  can: isotp: check CAN address family in isotp_bind()

  Add missing check to block non-AF_CAN binds.

  Syzbot created some code which matched the right sockaddr struct size
  but used AF_XDP (0x2C) instead of AF_CAN (0x1D) in the address family
  field:

  bind$xdp(r2, &(0x7f0000000540)={0x2c, 0x0, r4, 0x0, r2}, 0x10)
                                  ^^^^
  This has no funtional impact but the userspace should be notified about
  the wrong address family field content.
