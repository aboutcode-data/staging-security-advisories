aliases: []
summary: Overleaf is a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor. Overleaf Community Edition and
  Server Pro prior to version 5.0.7 (or 4.2.7 for the 4.x series) contain a vulnerability that
  allows an arbitrary language parameter in client spelling requests to be passed to the `aspell`
  executable running on the server.  This causes `aspell` to attempt to load  a dictionary file
  with an arbitrary filename. File access is limited to the scope of the overleaf server. The
  problem is patched in versions 5.0.7 and 4.2.7.  Previous versions can be upgraded using the
  Overleaf toolkit `bin/upgrade` command. Users unable to upgrade may block POST requests to
  `/spelling/check` via a Web Application Firewall will prevent access to the vulnerable spell
  check feature.  However, upgrading is advised.
