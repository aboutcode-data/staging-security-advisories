aliases: []
summary: Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to version 0.11.2,
  an authorization bypass in the LFS lock deletion endpoint allows any authenticated user with
  repository write access to delete locks owned by other users by setting the force flag. The
  vulnerable code path processes force deletions before retrieving user context, bypassing ownership
  validation entirely. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.2.
