aliases: []
summary: Sliver is a command and control framework that uses a custom Wireguard netstack. Prior
  to 1.7.0, the DNS C2 listener accepts unauthenticated TOTP bootstrap messages and allocates
  server-side DNS sessions without validating OTP values, even when EnforceOTP is enabled. Because
  sessions are stored without a cleanup/expiry path in this flow, an unauthenticated remote
  actor can repeatedly create sessions and drive memory exhaustion. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.7.0.
