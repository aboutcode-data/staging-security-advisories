aliases: []
summary: Deck Mate 2 is distributed with static, hard-coded credentials for the root shell and
  web user interface, while multiple management services (SSH, HTTP, Telnet, SMB, X11) are enabled
  by default. If an attacker can reach these interfaces - most often through local or near-local
  access such as connecting to the USB or Ethernet ports beneath the table - the built-in credentials
  permit administrative login and full control of the system. Once authenticated, an attacker
  can access firmware utilities, modify controller software, and establish persistent compromise.
  Remote attack paths via network, cellular, or telemetry links may exist in specific configurations
  but generally require additional capabilities or operator error. The vendor reports that USB
  access has been disabled in current firmware builds.
