summary: "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki\
  \ Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause\
  \ a denial of service (DoS) condition in the Cisco AnyConnect service on an affected device.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to&nbsp;variable initialization errors when an SSL VPN session\
  \ is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted\
  \ HTTPS requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause\
  \ the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of all established\
  \ SSL VPN sessions and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and re-authenticate.\
  \ A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established, effectively\
  \ making the Cisco AnyConnect VPN service unavailable for all legitimate users."
