  thunderbolt: Fix use-after-free in tb_dp_dprx_work

  The original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in tb_dp_dprx_stop(),
  which does not ensure that the delayed work item tunnel->dprx_work has
  fully completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free
  scenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while
  tunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel
  in tb_dp_dprx_work().

  A typical race condition is illustrated below:

  CPU 0                            | CPU 1
  tb_dp_tunnel_active()            |
    tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()
      tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()
        tb_dp_activate()           |
          tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker
            cancel_delayed_work()  |
      tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |
                                   |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF
                                   |   tunnel-> //UAF

  Replacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is
  not feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()
  and the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()
  would wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.

  Instead, implement proper reference counting:
  - If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release
    the reference in the stop function.
  - If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the
    reference is released in delayed work function itself.

  This ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution
  while preventing memory leaks.

  This bug was found by static analysis.
