aliases: []
summary: The Zegen Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to
  Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to missing nonce
  validation and missing file type validation in the '/custom-font-code/custom-fonts-uploads.php'
  file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the
  affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
