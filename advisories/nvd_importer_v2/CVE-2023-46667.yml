aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Fleet Server >= v8.10.0 and < v8.10.3 where Agent enrolment
  tokens are being inserted into the Fleet Server’s log file in plain text. These enrolment
  tokens could allow someone to enrol an agent into an agent policy, and potentially use that
  to retrieve other secrets in the policy including for Elasticsearch and third-party services.
  Alternatively a threat actor could potentially enrol agents to the clusters and send arbitrary
  events to Elasticsearch.
