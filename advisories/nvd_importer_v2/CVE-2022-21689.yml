aliases: []
summary: OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files,
  host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network. In affected versions the receive
  mode limits concurrent uploads to 100 per second and blocks other uploads in the same second,
  which can be triggered by a simple script. An adversary with access to the receive mode can
  block file upload for others. There is no way to block this attack in public mode due to the
  anonymity properties of the tor network.
