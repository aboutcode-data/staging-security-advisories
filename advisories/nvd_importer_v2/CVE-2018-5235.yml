aliases: []
summary: Norton Utilities (prior to 16.0.3.44) may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading vulnerability,
  which is a type of issue that can occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution
  and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application
  is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability
  can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a
  foreign DLL running under the context of the application.
