summary: The Fluent Forms – Customizable Contact Forms, Survey, Quiz, & Conversational Form
  Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in all versions up to, and
  including, 5.2.12 due to insufficient IP address validation and use of user-supplied HTTP
  headers as a primary method for IP retrieval. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  spoof their IP address and submit forms that may have IP-based restrictions.
