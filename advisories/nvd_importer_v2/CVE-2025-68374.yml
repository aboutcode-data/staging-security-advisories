summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md: fix rcu protection in md_wakeup_thread

  We attempted to use RCU to protect the pointer 'thread', but directly
  passed the value when calling md_wakeup_thread(). This means that the
  RCU pointer has been acquired before rcu_read_lock(), which renders
  rcu_read_lock() ineffective and could lead to a use-after-free.
