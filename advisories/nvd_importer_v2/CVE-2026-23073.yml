  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: rsi: Fix memory corruption due to not set vif driver data size

  The struct ieee80211_vif contains trailing space for vif driver data,
  when struct ieee80211_vif is allocated, the total memory size that is
  allocated is sizeof(struct ieee80211_vif) + size of vif driver data.
  The size of vif driver data is set by each WiFi driver as needed.

  The RSI911x driver does not set vif driver data size, no trailing space
  for vif driver data is therefore allocated past struct ieee80211_vif .
  The RSI911x driver does however use the vif driver data to store its
  vif driver data structure "struct vif_priv". An access to vif->drv_priv
  leads to access out of struct ieee80211_vif bounds and corruption of
  some memory.

  In case of the failure observed locally, rsi_mac80211_add_interface()
  would write struct vif_priv *vif_info = (struct vif_priv *)vif->drv_priv;
  vif_info->vap_id = vap_idx. This write corrupts struct fq_tin member
  struct list_head new_flows . The flow = list_first_entry(head, struct
  fq_flow, flowchain); in fq_tin_reset() then reports non-NULL bogus
  address, which when accessed causes a crash.

  The trigger is very simple, boot the machine with init=/bin/sh , mount
  devtmpfs, sysfs, procfs, and then do "ip link set wlan0 up", "sleep 1",
  "ip link set wlan0 down" and the crash occurs.

  Fix this by setting the correct size of vif driver data, which is the
  size of "struct vif_priv", so that memory is allocated and the driver
  can store its driver data in it, instead of corrupting memory around
  it.
