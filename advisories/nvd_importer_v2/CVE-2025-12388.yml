aliases: []
summary: The B Carousel Block – Responsive Image and Content Carousel plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This is
  due to the plugin not validating user-supplied URLs before passing them to the wp_remote_request()
  function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access
  and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application
  and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
