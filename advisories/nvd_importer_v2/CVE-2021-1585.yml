aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) Launcher could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a user's operating
  system. This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper signature verification for specific
  code exchanged between the ASDM and the Launcher. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position on the network to intercept the traffic between
  the Launcher and the ASDM and then inject arbitrary code. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's operating system with the level of privileges
  assigned to the ASDM Launcher. A successful exploit may require the attacker to perform a
  social engineering attack to persuade the user to initiate communication from the Launcher
  to the ASDM.
