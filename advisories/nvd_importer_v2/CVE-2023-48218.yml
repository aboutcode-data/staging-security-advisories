aliases: []
summary: The Strapi Protected Populate Plugin protects `get` endpoints from revealing too much
  information. Prior to version 1.3.4, users were able to bypass the field level security. Users
  who tried to populate something that they didn't have access to could populate those fields
  anyway. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.4. There are no known workarounds.
