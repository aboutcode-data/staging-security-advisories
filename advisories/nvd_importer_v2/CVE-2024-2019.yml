aliases: []
summary: The WP-DB-Table-Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of
  data, modification of data, and loss of data due to lack of a default capability requirement
  on the 'dbte_render' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify database tables
  that the theme has been configured to use the plugin to edit.
