aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix null pointer deref in mt7996_conf_tx()

  If a link does not have an assigned channel yet, mt7996_vif_link returns
  NULL. We still need to store the updated queue settings in that case, and
  apply them later.
  Move the location of the queue params to within struct mt7996_vif_link.
