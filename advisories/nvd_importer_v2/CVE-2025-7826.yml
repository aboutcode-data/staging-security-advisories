aliases: []
summary: The Testimonial plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'iNICtestimonial'
  shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user
  supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append
  additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
  information from the database.
