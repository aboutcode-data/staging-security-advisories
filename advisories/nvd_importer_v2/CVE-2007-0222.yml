summary: 'Directory traversal vulnerability in the EmChartBean server side component for Oracle
  Application Server 10g allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via unknown vectors,
  probably "\.." sequences in the beanId parameter.  NOTE: this is likely a duplicate of another
  CVE that Oracle addressed in CPU Jan 2007, but due to lack of details by Oracle, it is unclear
  which BugID this issue is associated with, so the other CVE cannot be determined.  Possibilities
  include EM02 (CVE-2007-0292) or EM05 (CVE-2007-0293).'
