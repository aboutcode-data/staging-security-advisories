aliases: []
summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey`
  hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor,
  and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access
  individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN
  failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor,
  including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes
  in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types
  such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves.
  This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1.
