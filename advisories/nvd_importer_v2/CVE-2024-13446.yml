aliases: []
summary: 'The Workreap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account
  takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.5. This is due to the plugin not properly
  validating a user''s identity prior to (1) performing a social auto-login or (2) updating
  their profile details (e.g. password). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to (1) login as an arbitrary user if their email address is known or (2) change an arbitrary
  user''s password, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
  NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 3.2.5.'
