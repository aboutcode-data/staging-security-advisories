aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in parisneo/lollms-webui versions up to 9.3 allows remote attackers
  to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of the `/apply_settings`
  and `/execute_code` endpoints. Attackers can bypass protections by setting the host to localhost,
  enabling code execution, and disabling code validation through the `/apply_settings` endpoint.
  Subsequently, arbitrary commands can be executed remotely via the `/execute_code` endpoint,
  exploiting the delay in settings enforcement. This issue was addressed in version 9.5.
