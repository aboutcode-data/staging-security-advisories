aliases: []
summary: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. When the DataHub frontend is configured
  to authenticate via SSO, it will leverage the pac4j library. The processing of the `id_token`
  is done in an unsafe manner which is not properly accounted for by the DataHub frontend. Specifically,
  if any of the id_token claims value start with the {#sb64} prefix, pac4j considers the value
  to be a serialized Java object and will deserialize it. This issue may lead to Remote Code
  Execution (RCE) in the worst case. Although a `RestrictedObjectInputStream` is in place, that
  puts some restriction on what classes can be deserialized, it still allows a broad range of
  java packages and potentially exploitable with different gadget chains. Users are advised
  to upgrade. There are no known workarounds. This vulnerability was discovered and reported
  by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked as GHSL-2022-086.
