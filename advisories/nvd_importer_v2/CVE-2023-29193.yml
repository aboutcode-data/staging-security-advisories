aliases: []
summary: |
  SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. The `spicedb serve` command contains a flag named `--grpc-preshared-key` which is used to protect the gRPC API from being accessed by unauthorized requests. The values of this flag are to be considered sensitive, secret data. The `/debug/pprof/cmdline` endpoint served by the metrics service (defaulting running on port `9090`) reveals the command-line flags provided for debugging purposes. If a password is set via the `--grpc-preshared-key` then the key is revealed by this endpoint along with any other flags provided to the SpiceDB binary. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1.

  ### Impact

  All deployments abiding by the recommended best practices for production usage are **NOT affected**:
  - Authzed's SpiceDB Serverless
  - Authzed's SpiceDB Dedicated
  - SpiceDB Operator

  Users configuring SpiceDB via environment variables are **NOT affected**.

  Users **MAY be affected** if they expose their metrics port to an untrusted network and are configuring `--grpc-preshared-key` via command-line flag.

  ### Patches

  TODO

  ### Workarounds

  To workaround this issue you can do one of the following:

  - Configure the preshared key via an environment variable (e.g. `SPICEDB_GRPC_PRESHARED_KEY=yoursecret spicedb serve`)
  - Reconfigure the `--metrics-addr` flag to bind to a trusted network (e.g. `--metrics-addr=localhost:9090`)
  - Disable the metrics service via the flag (e.g. `--metrics-enabled=false`)
  - Adopt one of the recommended deployment models: [Authzed's managed services](https://authzed.com/pricing) or the [SpiceDB Operator](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb-operator)
