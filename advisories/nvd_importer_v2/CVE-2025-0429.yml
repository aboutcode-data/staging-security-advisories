aliases: []
summary: 'The "AI Power: Complete AI Pack" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object
  Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.8.96 via deserialization of untrusted input
  from the $form[''post_content''] variable through the wpaicg_export_ai_forms() function. This
  allows authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges, to inject a PHP Object. No
  POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional
  plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
  files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.'
