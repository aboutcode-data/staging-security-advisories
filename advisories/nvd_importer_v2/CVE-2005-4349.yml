aliases: []
summary: 'SQL injection vulnerability in server_privileges.php in phpMyAdmin 2.7.0 allows remote
  authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) dbname and (2) checkprivs
  parameters.  NOTE: the vendor and a third party have disputed this issue, saying that the
  main task of the program is to support query execution by authenticated users, and no external
  attack scenario exists without an auto-login configuration.  Thus it is likely that this issue
  will be REJECTED.  However, a closely related CSRF issue has been assigned CVE-2005-4450'
