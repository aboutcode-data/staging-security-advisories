summary: thmmniii/fbs-core is an open source feedback system for students. In versions prior
  to 1.5.3 when querying `subresults`, it is possible to query `subresults` from other users
  due to insufficient authorisation. This is only possible for logged-in users and it is not
  possible to associate the subresults with a specific user. This bug was fixed in commit `f1ae67d8bb2`and
  released with version 1.5.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
