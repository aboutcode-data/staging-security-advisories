aliases: []
summary: ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Versions 5.5.2-#187 and below
  allow an attacker to perform Blind SQL Injection through the add comment section within a
  channel. When adding a comment within a channel, there is a POST request to the /actions/ajax.php
  endpoint. The obj_id parameter within the POST request to /actions/ajax.php is then used within
  the user_exists function of the upload/includes/classes/user.class. php file as the $id parameter.
  It is then used within the count function of the upload/includes/classes/db.class. php file.
  The $id parameter is concatenated into the query without validation or sanitization, and a
  user-supplied input like 1' or 1=1-- - can be used to trigger the injection. This issue does
  not have a fix at the time of publication.
