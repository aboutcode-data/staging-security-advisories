aliases: []
summary: The Post Grid Master – Custom Post Types, Taxonomies & Ajax Filter Everything with
  Infinite Scroll, Load More, Pagination & Shortcode Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.12 via the 'locate_template'
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary
  files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used
  to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where
  images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. The file included must have
  a .php extension.
