summary: The WP Easy FAQs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's WP_EASY_FAQ shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
