summary: The Website Toolbox Community plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting via the ‘websitetoolbox_username’ parameter in all versions up to, and including,

  unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can
  successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
