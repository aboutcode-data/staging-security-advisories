aliases: []
summary: The BSK PDF Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.1 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  Administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses the SVG file. This only affects multi-site installations and installations
  where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
