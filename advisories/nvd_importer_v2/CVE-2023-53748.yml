  media: mediatek: vcodec: Fix potential array out-of-bounds in decoder queue_setup

  variable *nplanes is provided by user via system call argument. The
  possible value of q_data->fmt->num_planes is 1-3, while the value
  of *nplanes can be 1-8. The array access by index i can cause array
  out-of-bounds.

  Fix this bug by checking *nplanes against the array size.
