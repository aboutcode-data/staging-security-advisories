aliases: []
summary: The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.24.5. This is due to insufficient controls on the
  user role select field when utilizing the 'Role' field in a form. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to create new administrative user accounts, even when the administrative
  user role has not been provided as an option to the user, granted that unauthenticated users
  have been provided access to the form.
