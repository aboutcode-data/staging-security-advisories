aliases: []
summary: 'Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 38.0.4, 37.0.3, 36.0.3, and
  24.0.5, Wasmtime''s Rust embedder API contains an unsound interaction where a WebAssembly
  shared linear memory could be viewed as a type which provides safe access to the host (Rust)
  to the contents of the linear memory. This is not sound for shared linear memories, which
  could be modified in parallel, and this could lead to a data race in the host. Patch releases
  have been issued for all supported versions of Wasmtime, notably: 24.0.5, 36.0.3, 37.0.3,
  and 38.0.4. These releases reject creation of shared memories via `Memory::new` and shared
  memories are now excluded from core dumps. As a workaround, eembeddings affected by this issue
  should use `SharedMemory::new` instead of `Memory::new` to create shared memories. Affected
  embeddings should also disable core dumps if they are unable to upgrade. Note that core dumps
  are disabled by default but the wasm threads proposal (and shared memory) is enabled by default.'
