aliases: []
summary: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Starting with\
  \ the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16, 9.2.10, and 9.3.4, Grafana had a stored XSS\
  \ vulnerability affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible\
  \ because SVG files weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed\
  \ in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. \n\nAn attacker\
  \ needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include either an external URL\
  \ to a SVG-file containing JavaScript, or use the `data:` scheme to load an inline SVG-file\
  \ containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where\
  \ a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the\
  \ user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.   \n\nUsers may\
  \ upgrade to version 8.5.16, 9.2.10, or 9.3.4 to receive a fix."
