summary: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server versions 2.1.0 above
  have a user interface tool, accessible only to server owners and server administrators, which
  provides a way to download a "public data" export. While this export is only accessible to
  administrators, in many configurations server administrators are not expected to have access
  to private messages and private streams. However, the "public data" export which administrators
  could generate contained the attachment contents for all attachments, even those from private
  messages and streams. Zulip Server version 5.4 contains a patch for this issue.
