summary: An issue was discovered in Samsung Magician 8.0.0 on macOS. Because it is possible
  to tamper with the directory and executable files used during the installation process, an
  attacker can escalate privileges through arbitrary code execution. (The attacker must already
  have user privileges, and an administrator password must be entered during the program installation
  stage for privilege escalation.)
