aliases: []
summary: Trustee is a set of tools and components for attesting confidential guests and providing
  secrets to them. The ART (**Attestation Results Token**) token, generated by AS, could be
  manipulated by MITM attacker, but the verifier (CoCo Verification Demander like KBS) could
  still verify it successfully. In the payload of ART token, the ‘jwk’ could be replaced by
  attacker with his own pub key. Then attacker can use his own corresponding private key to
  sign the crafted ART token. Based on current code implementation (v0.8.0), such replacement
  and modification can not be detected. This issue has been addressed in version 0.8.2 and all
  users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
