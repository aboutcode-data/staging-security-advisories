aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center
  Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected
  device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the
  web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker
  needs valid administrator credentials.
