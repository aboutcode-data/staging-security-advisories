aliases: []
summary: An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards Premium plugin
  before 3.3.1 for WordPress allows remote attackers to achieve remote code execution on the
  operating system in the security context of the web server. In order to exploit this vulnerability,
  an attacker must be able to place a valid Gift Card product into the shopping cart. An uploaded
  file is placed at a predetermined path on the web server with a user-specified filename and
  extension. This occurs because the ywgc-upload-picture parameter can have a .php value even
  though the intention was to only allow uploads of Gift Card images.
