summary: NVIDIA GeForce Experience, all versions prior to 3.23, contains a vulnerability in
  the login flow when a user tries to log in by using a browser, while, at the same time, any
  other web page is loaded in other tabs of the same browser. In this situation, the web page
  can get access to the token of the user login session, leading to the possibility that the
  user’s account is compromised. This may lead to the targeted user’s data being accessed, altered,
  or lost.
