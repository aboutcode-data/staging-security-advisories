aliases: []
summary: 'Insufficient input validation and sanitation in Weblog Category name, Website About
  and File Upload features in all versions of Apache Roller on all platforms allows an authenticated
  user to perform an XSS attack. Mitigation: if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted
  users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other
  web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.2
  and you should disable Roller''s File Upload feature.'
