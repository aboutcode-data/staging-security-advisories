aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in
  Kibana logs in the event of an error. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.1 which resolves this
  issue. The error message recorded in the log may contain account credentials for the kibana_system
  user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users. The issue occurs infrequently, only if
  an error is returned from an Elasticsearch cluster, in cases where there is user interaction
  and an unhealthy cluster (for example, when returning circuit breaker or no shard exceptions).
