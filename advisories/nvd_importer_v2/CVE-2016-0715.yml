aliases: []
summary: Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime version 1.4.0 through 1.4.5, 1.5.0 through 1.5.11
  and 1.6.0 through 1.6.11 is vulnerable to a remote information disclosure. It was found that
  original mitigation configuration instructions provided as part of CVE-2016-0708 were incomplete
  and could leave PHP Buildpack, Staticfile Buildpack and potentially other custom Buildpack
  applications vulnerable to remote information disclosure. Affected applications use automated
  buildpack detection, serve files directly from the root of the application and have a buildpack
  that matched after the Java Buildpack in the system buildpack priority when Java Buildpack
  versions 2.0 through 3.4 were present.
