aliases: []
summary: The CRM WordPress Plugin – RepairBuddy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
  escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.8120. This is due
  to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their email through
  the wc_update_user_data AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators,
  and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
