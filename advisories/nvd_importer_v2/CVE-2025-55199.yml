aliases: []
summary: Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to version 3.18.5, it is
  possible to craft a JSON Schema file in a manner which could cause Helm to use all available
  memory and have an out of memory (OOM) termination. This issue has been resolved in Helm 3.18.5.
  A workaround involves ensuring all Helm charts that are being loaded into Helm do not have
  any reference of $ref pointing to /dev/zero.
