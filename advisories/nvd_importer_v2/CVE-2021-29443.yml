aliases: []
summary: jose is an npm library providing a number of cryptographic operations. In vulnerable
  versions AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithm (A128CBC-HS256, A192CBC-HS384, A256CBC-HS512) decryption
  would always execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption, if either failed `JWEDecryptionFailed`
  would be thrown. A possibly observable difference in timing when padding error would occur
  while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle and an adversary might be able to make
  use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average
  128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block).
  All major release versions have had a patch released which ensures the HMAC tag is verified
  before performing CBC decryption. The fixed versions are `^1.28.1 || ^2.0.5 || >=3.11.4`.
  Users should upgrade their v1.x dependency to ^1.28.1, their v2.x dependency to ^2.0.5, and
  their v3.x dependency to ^3.11.4. Thanks to Jason from Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR)
  for bringing this up and Eva Sarafianou (@esarafianou) for helping to score this advisory.
