summary: "A vulnerability in the Day One setup process of Cisco IOS XE Software for Catalyst\
  \ 9800 Series Wireless Controllers for Cloud (9800-CL) could allow an unauthenticated, remote\
  \ attacker to access the public-key infrastructure (PKI) server that is running on an affected\
  \ device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to incomplete cleanup upon completion of the Day\
  \ One setup process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending Simple Certificate\
  \ Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow\
  \ the attacker to request a certificate from the virtual wireless controller and then use\
  \ the acquired certificate to join an attacker-controlled device to the virtual wireless controller."
