aliases: []
summary: BerriAI's litellm, in its latest version, is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to improper input validation on the `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. An attacker can
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request that includes a file path
  to the server, which then deletes the specified file without proper authorization or validation.
  This vulnerability is present in the code where `os.remove(file.filename)` is used to delete
  a file, allowing any user to delete critical files on the server such as SSH keys, SQLite
  databases, or configuration files.
