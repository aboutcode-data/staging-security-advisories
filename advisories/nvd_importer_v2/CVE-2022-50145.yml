  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread support for a DMA channel

  When we get a DMA channel and try to use it in multiple threads it
  will cause oops and hanging the system.

  % echo 64 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/threads_per_chan
  % echo 10000 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/iterations
  % echo 1 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/run
  [   89.480664] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
                 address 00000000000000a0
  [   89.488725] Oops [#1]
  [   89.494708] CPU: 2 PID: 1008 Comm: dma0chan0-copy0 Not tainted

  [   89.509385] epc : vchan_find_desc+0x32/0x46
  [   89.513553]  ra : sf_pdma_tx_status+0xca/0xd6

  This happens because of data race. Each thread rewrite channels's
  descriptor as soon as device_prep_dma_memcpy() is called. It leads to the
  situation when the driver thinks that it uses right descriptor that
  actually is freed or substituted for other one.

  With current fixes a descriptor changes its value only when it has
  been used. A new descriptor is acquired from vc->desc_issued queue that
  is already filled with descriptors that are ready to be sent. Threads
  have no direct access to DMA channel descriptor. Now it is just possible
  to queue a descriptor for further processing.
