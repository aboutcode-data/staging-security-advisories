summary: The myCred – Points Management System For Gamification, Ranks, Badges, and Loyalty
  Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and
  including, 2.9.7.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized
  to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to retrieve sensitive information including user IDs, display names, and
  email addresses of all users on the site via the get_bank_accounts AJAX action. Passwords
  are not exposed.
