aliases: []
summary: 'Steeltoe is an open source project that provides a collection of libraries that helps
  users build production-grade cloud-native applications using externalized configuration, service
  discovery, distributed tracing, application management, and more. When utilizing multiple
  Eureka server service URLs with basic auth and encountering an issue with fetching the service
  registry, an error is logged with the Eureka server service URLs but only the first URL is
  masked. The code in question is  `_logger.LogError(e, "FetchRegistry Failed for Eureka service
  urls: {EurekaServerServiceUrls}", new Uri(ClientConfig.EurekaServerServiceUrls).ToMaskedString());`
  in the `DiscoveryClient.cs` file which may leak credentials into logs. This issue has been
  addressed in version 3.2.8 of the Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka nuget package.'
