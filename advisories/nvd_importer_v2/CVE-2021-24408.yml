aliases: []
summary: The Prismatic WordPress plugin before 2.8 does not sanitise or validate some of its
  shortcode parameters, allowing users with a role as low as Contributor to set Cross-Site payload
  in them. A post made by a contributor would still have to be approved by an admin to have
  the XSS trigger able in the frontend, however, higher privilege users, such as editor could
  exploit this without the need of approval, and even when the blog disallows the unfiltered_html
  capability.
