aliases: []
summary: The WP ERP | Complete HR solution with recruitment & job listings | WooCommerce CRM
  & Accounting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter
  via the erp/v1/accounting/v1/vendors/1/products/ REST route in all versions up to, and including,
  1.12.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient
  preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with admin or accounting manager privileges, to append additional SQL queries into already
  existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
