aliases: []
summary: The TP2WP Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'Watched domains' textarea on the attachment importer settings page in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
  when domains are saved via AJAX and rendered with echo implode() without esc_textarea(). This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the attachment
  importer settings page.
