summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: dsa: microchip: Don't free uninitialized ksz_irq

  If something goes wrong at setup, ksz_irq_free() can be called on
  uninitialized ksz_irq (for example when ksz_ptp_irq_setup() fails). It
  leads to freeing uninitialized IRQ numbers and/or domains.

  Use dsa_switch_for_each_user_port_continue_reverse() in the error path
  to iterate only over the fully initialized ports.
