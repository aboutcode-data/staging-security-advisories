aliases: []
summary: FileRise is a self-hosted web file manager / WebDAV server. Versions prior to 3.3.0,
  the application contains an unauthenticated file read vulnerability due to the lack of access
  control on the /uploads directory. Files uploaded to this directory can be accessed directly
  by any user who knows or can guess the file path, without requiring authentication. As a result,
  sensitive data could be exposed, and privacy may be breached. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 3.3.0.
