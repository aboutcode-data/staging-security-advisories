summary: Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39 and 3.3.2, it is
  possible to confirm a single character of a user's password hash using a specially crafted
  regular expression filter in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can
  eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the response, however the presence
  or absence of a result confirms if the character is in the right position. The API has throttling
  enabled by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and the users endpoint
  need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default. The issue has been fixed in versions
  3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and above.
