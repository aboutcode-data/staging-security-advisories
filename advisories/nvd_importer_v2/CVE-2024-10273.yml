aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, improper privilege management in the models.ts file allows
  users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does
  not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they
  should not have access to modify. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized changes in
  critical resources, affecting the integrity and reliability of the system.
