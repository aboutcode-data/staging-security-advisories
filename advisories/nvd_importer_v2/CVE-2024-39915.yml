aliases: []
summary: Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface for Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken
  using the Livestatus API. This authenticated RCE in Thruk allows authorized users with network
  access to inject arbitrary commands via the URL parameter during PDF report generation. The
  Thruk web application does not properly process the url parameter when generating a PDF report.
  An authorized attacker with access to the reporting functionality could inject arbitrary commands
  that would be executed when the script /script/html2pdf.sh is called. The vulnerability can
  be exploited by an authorized user with network access. This issue has been addressed in version
  3.16. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
