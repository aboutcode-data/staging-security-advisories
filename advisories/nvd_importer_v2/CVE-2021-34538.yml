summary: Apache Hive before 3.1.3 "CREATE" and "DROP" function operations does not check for
  necessary authorization of involved entities in the query. It was found that an unauthorized
  user can manipulate an existing UDF without having the privileges to do so. This allowed unauthorized
  or underprivileged users to drop and recreate UDFs pointing them to new jars that could be
  potentially malicious.
