aliases: []
summary: A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in SevenCs ORCA G2 2.0.1.35 (EC2007
  Kernel v5.22). The flaw is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the license
  management logic. The regService process, which runs with SYSTEM privileges, creates a fixed
  directory and writes files without verifying whether the path is an NTFS reparse point. By
  exploiting this race condition, an attacker can replace the target directory with a junction
  pointing to a user-controlled path. This causes the SYSTEM-level process to drop binaries
  in a location fully controlled by the attacker, allowing arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM
  privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited by any standard user with only a single UAC
  confirmation, making it highly practical and dangerous in real-world environments.
