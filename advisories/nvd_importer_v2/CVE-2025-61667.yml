summary: The Datadog Agent collects events and metrics from hosts and sends them to Datadog.
  A vulnerability within the Datadog Linux Host Agent versions 7.65.0 through 7.70.2 exists
  due to insufficient permissions being set on the `opt/datadog-agent/python-scripts/__pycache__`
  directory during installation. Code in this directory is only run by the Agent during Agent
  install/upgrades.  This could allow an attacker with local access to modify files in this
  directory, which would then subsequently be run when the Agent is upgraded, resulting in local
  privilege escalation. This issue requires local access to the host and a valid low privilege
  account to be vulnerable. Note that this vulnerability only impacts the Linux Host Agent.
  Other variations of the Agent including the container, kubernetes, windows host and other
  agents are not impacted. Version 7.71.0 contains a patch for the issue.
