aliases: []
summary: Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. When using the AWS S3
  or GCS storage provider for TechDocs it is possible to access content in the entire storage
  bucket. This can leak contents of the bucket that are not intended to be accessible, as well
  as bypass permission checks in Backstage. This has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the
  `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package. All users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
