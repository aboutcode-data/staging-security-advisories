aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the gnome-remote-desktop package. The gnome-remote-desktop system
  daemon performs inadequate validation of session agents using D-Bus methods related to transitioning
  a client connection from the login screen to the user session. As a result, the system RDP
  TLS certificate and key can be exposed to unauthorized users. This flaw allows a malicious
  user on the system to take control of the RDP client connection during the login screen-to-user
  session transition.
