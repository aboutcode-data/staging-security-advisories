aliases: []
summary: REDCap through 14.9.6 has a security flaw in the Notes section of calendar events,
  exposing users to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. An attacker can exploit this
  by luring users into accessing a calendar event's notes, which triggers a logout request and
  terminates their session. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on
  the logout functionality, allowing malicious actions to be executed without user consent.
