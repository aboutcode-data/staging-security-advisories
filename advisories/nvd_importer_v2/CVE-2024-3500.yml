aliases: []
summary: The ElementsKit Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all
  versions up to, and including, 3.6.0 via the Price Menu, Hotspot, and Advanced Toggle widgets.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code
  in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve
  code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
