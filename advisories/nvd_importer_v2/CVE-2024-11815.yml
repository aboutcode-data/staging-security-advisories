summary: The Pósturinn\&#039;s Shipping with WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the printed_marked and nonprinted_marked parameters
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts
  in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such
  as clicking on a link.
