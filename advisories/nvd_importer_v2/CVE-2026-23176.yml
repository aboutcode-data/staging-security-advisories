  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  platform/x86: toshiba_haps: Fix memory leaks in add/remove routines

  toshiba_haps_add() leaks the haps object allocated by it if it returns
  an error after allocating that object successfully.

  toshiba_haps_remove() does not free the object pointed to by
  toshiba_haps before clearing that pointer, so it becomes unreachable
  allocated memory.

  Address these memory leaks by using devm_kzalloc() for allocating
  the memory in question.
