summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/9p: use a dedicated spinlock for trans_fd

  Shamelessly copying the explanation from Tetsuo Handa's suggested
  patch[1] (slightly reworded):
  syzbot is reporting inconsistent lock state in p9_req_put()[2],
  for p9_tag_remove() from p9_req_put() from IRQ context is using
  spin_lock_irqsave() on "struct p9_client"->lock but trans_fd
  (not from IRQ context) is using spin_lock().

  Since the locks actually protect different things in client.c and in
  trans_fd.c, just replace trans_fd.c's lock by a new one specific to the
  transport (client.c's protect the idr for fid/tag allocations,
  while trans_fd.c's protects its own req list and request status field
  that acts as the transport's state machine)
