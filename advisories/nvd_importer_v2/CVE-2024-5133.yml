aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.4, an account takeover vulnerability exists due to
  the exposure of password recovery tokens in API responses. Specifically, when a user initiates
  the password reset process, the recovery token is included in the response of the `GET /v1/users/me/org`
  endpoint, which lists all users in a team. This allows any authenticated user to capture the
  recovery token of another user and subsequently change that user's password without consent,
  effectively taking over the account. The issue lies in the inclusion of the `recovery_token`
  attribute in the users object returned by the API.
