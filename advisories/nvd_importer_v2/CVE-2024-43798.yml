aliases: []
summary: Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. The Chisel
  server doesn't ever read the documented `AUTH` environment variable used to set credentials,
  which allows any unauthenticated user to connect, even if credentials were set. Anyone running
  the Chisel server that is using the `AUTH` environment variable to specify credentials to
  authenticate against is affected by this vulnerability. Chisel is often used to provide an
  entrypoint to a private network, which means services that are gated by Chisel may be affected.
  Additionally, Chisel is often used for exposing services to the internet. An attacker could
  MITM requests by connecting to a Chisel server and requesting to forward traffic from a remote
  port. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.10.0. All users are advised to upgrade.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
