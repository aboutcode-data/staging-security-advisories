summary: 'Quinn is a pure-Rust, async-compatible implementation of the IETF QUIC transport protocol.
  As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`,
  or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection
  exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or
  `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received.
  This issue can go undetected until a server''s `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised,
  such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting
  validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet
  that successfully decrypts and doesn''t exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can
  go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application,
  while the latter is only theoretical.'
