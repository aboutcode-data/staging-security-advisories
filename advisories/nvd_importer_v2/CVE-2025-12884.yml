aliases: []
summary: The Advanced Ads – Ad Manager & AdSense plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
  bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.0.14. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying
  that a user is authorized to perform an action in the `placement_update_item()` function.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above,
  to update ad placements, allowing them to change which ad or ad group a placement serves.
