aliases: []
summary: The WP-Force Images Download plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'wpfid' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.8. This is due
  to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'class' attribute. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
