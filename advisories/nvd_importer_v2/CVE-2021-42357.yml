summary: When using Apache Knox SSO prior to 1.6.1, a request could be crafted to redirect a
  user to a malicious page due to improper URL parsing. A request that included a specially
  crafted request parameter could be used to redirect the user to a page controlled by an attacker.
  This URL would need to be presented to the user outside the normal request flow through a
  XSS or phishing campaign.
