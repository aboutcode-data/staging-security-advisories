aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the pixxio (aka pixx.io integration or DAM) extension before
  1.0.6 for TYPO3. The extension fails to restrict the image download to the configured pixx.io
  DAM URL, resulting in SSRF. As a result, an attacker can download various content from a remote
  location and save it to a user-controlled filename, which may result in Remote Code Execution.
  A TYPO3 backend user account is required to exploit this.
