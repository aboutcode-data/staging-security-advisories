  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries

  When the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only
  supports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission
  is not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should
  always set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions
  that allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to
  have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things
  to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.
  Hence remove this configuration.
