aliases: []
summary: In core_info_read and inst_info_read in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux
  kernel, variable "dbg_buf", "dbg_buf->curr" and "dbg_buf->filled_size" could be modified by
  different threads at the same time, but they are not protected with mutex or locks. Buffer
  overflow is possible on race conditions. "buffer->curr" itself could also be overwritten,
  which means that it may point to anywhere of kernel memory (for write).
