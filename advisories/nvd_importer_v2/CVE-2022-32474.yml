aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. DMA attacks
  on the StorageSecurityCommandDxe shared buffer used by SMM and non-SMM code could cause TOCTOU
  race-condition issues that could lead to corruption of SMRAM and escalation of privileges.
  This attack can be mitigated using IOMMU protection for the ACPI runtime memory used for the
  command buffer. This attack can be mitigated by copying the firmware block services data to
  SMRAM before checking it.
