  staging: rtl8723bs: fix potential memory leak in rtw_init_drv_sw()

  In rtw_init_drv_sw(), there are various init functions are called to
  populate the padapter structure and some checks for their return value.
  However, except for the first one error path, the other five error paths
  do not properly release the previous allocated resources, which leads to
  various memory leaks.

  This patch fixes them and keeps the success and error separate.
  Note that these changes keep the form of `rtw_init_drv_sw()` in
  "drivers/staging/r8188eu/os_dep/os_intfs.c". As there is no proper device
  to test with, no runtime testing was performed.
