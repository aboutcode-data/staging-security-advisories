  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: x86: Use __try_cmpxchg_user() to update guest PTE A/D bits

  Use the recently introduced __try_cmpxchg_user() to update guest PTE A/D
  bits instead of mapping the PTE into kernel address space.  The VM_PFNMAP
  path is broken as it assumes that vm_pgoff is the base pfn of the mapped
  VMA range, which is conceptually wrong as vm_pgoff is the offset relative
  to the file and has nothing to do with the pfn.  The horrific hack worked
  for the original use case (backing guest memory with /dev/mem), but leads
  to accessing "random" pfns for pretty much any other VM_PFNMAP case.
