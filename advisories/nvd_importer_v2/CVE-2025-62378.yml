aliases: []
summary: CommandKit is the discord.js meta-framework for building Discord bots. In versions
  1.2.0-rc.1 through 1.2.0-rc.11, a logic flaw exists in the message command handler that affects
  how the commandName property is exposed to both middleware functions and command execution
  contexts when handling command aliases. When a message command is invoked using an alias,
  the ctx.commandName value reflects the alias rather than the canonical command name. This
  occurs in both middleware functions and within the command's own run function. Although not
  explicitly documented, CommandKit's examples and guidance around middleware usage implicitly
  convey that ctx.commandName represents the canonical command identifier. Middleware examples
  in the documentation consistently use ctx.commandName to reference the command being executed.
  Developers who assume ctx.commandName is canonical may introduce unintended behavior when
  relying on it for logic such as permission checks, rate limiting, or audit logging. This could
  allow unauthorized command execution or inaccurate access control decisions. Slash commands
  and context menu commands are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.0-rc.12,
  where ctx.commandName now consistently returns the actual canonical command name regardless
  of the alias used to invoke it.
