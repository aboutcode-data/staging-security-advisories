aliases: []
summary: Podium is a library for building micro frontends. @podium/layout is a module for building
  a Podium layout server, and @podium/proxy is a module for proxying HTTP requests from a layout
  server to a podlet server. In @podium/layout prior to version 4.6.110 and @podium/proxy prior
  to version 4.2.74, an attacker using the `Trailer` header as part of the request against proxy
  endpoints has the ability to take down the server. All Podium layouts that include podlets
  with proxy endpoints are affected. `@podium/layout`, which is the main way developers/users
  are vulnerable to this exploit, has been patched in version `4.6.110`. All earlier versions
  are vulnerable.`@podium/proxy`, which is the source of the vulnerability and is used by `@podium/layout`
  has been patched in version `4.2.74`. All earlier versions are vulnerable. It is not easily
  possible to work around this issue without upgrading.
