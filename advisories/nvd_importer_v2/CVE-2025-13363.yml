summary: The IMAQ Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the URL structure
  settings update functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  the plugin's URL structure settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
