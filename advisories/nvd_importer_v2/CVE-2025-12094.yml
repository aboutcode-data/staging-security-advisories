summary: 'The OOPSpam Anti-Spam: Spam Protection for WordPress Forms & Comments (No CAPTCHA)
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Header Spoofing in all versions up to, and including,
  1.2.53. This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled forwarded headers (such as CF-Connecting-IP,
  X-Forwarded-For, and others) without verifying that those headers originate from legitimate,
  trusted proxies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their IP address
  and bypass IP-based security controls, including blocked IP lists and rate limiting protections,
  by sending arbitrary HTTP headers with their requests.'
