aliases: []
summary: Fabio is an HTTP(S) and TCP router for deploying applications managed by consul. Prior
  to version 1.6.6, Fabio allows clients to remove X-Forwarded headers (except X-Forwarded-For)
  due to a vulnerability in how it processes hop-by-hop headers. Fabio adds HTTP headers like
  X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Port when routing requests to backend applications. Since
  the receiving application should trust these headers, allowing HTTP clients to remove or modify
  them creates potential security vulnerabilities. Some of these custom headers can be removed
  and, in certain cases, manipulated. The attack relies on the behavior that headers can be
  defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been patched in version
  1.6.6.
