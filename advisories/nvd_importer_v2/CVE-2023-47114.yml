aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of
  data privacy requests in your runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations
  in your code. The Fides web application allows data subject users to request access to their
  personal data. If the request is approved by the data controller user operating the Fides
  web application, the data subject's personal data can then retrieved from connected systems
  and data stores before being bundled together as a data subject access request package for
  the data subject to download. Supported data formats for the package include json and csv,
  but the most commonly used format is a series of HTML files compressed in a ZIP file. Once
  downloaded and unzipped, the data subject user can browse the HTML files on their local machine.
  It was identified that there was no validation of input coming from e.g. the connected systems
  and data stores which is later reflected in the downloaded data. This can result in an HTML
  injection that can be abused e.g. for phishing attacks or malicious JavaScript code execution,
  but only in the context of the data subject's browser accessing a HTML page using the `file://`
  protocol. Exploitation is limited to rogue Admin UI users, malicious connected system / data
  store users, and the data subject user if tricked via social engineering into submitting malicious
  data themselves. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.23.3.
