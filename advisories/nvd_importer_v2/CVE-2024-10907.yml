aliases: []
summary: In lm-sys/fastchat Release v0.2.36, the server fails to handle excessive characters
  appended to the end of multipart boundaries. This flaw can be exploited by sending malformed
  multipart requests with arbitrary characters at the end of the boundary. Each extra character
  is processed in an infinite loop, leading to excessive resource consumption and a complete
  denial of service (DoS) for all users. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no user
  login or interaction is required for an attacker to exploit this issue.
