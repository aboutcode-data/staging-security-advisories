aliases: []
summary: Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to
  13.5.0 the link to the instance to the sender that appears when viewing a user or note received
  through ActivityPub is not properly validated, so by inserting a URL with a javascript scheme
  an attacker may execute JavaScript code in the context of the recipient. This issue has been
  fixed in version 13.5.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not
  "view on remote" for untrusted instances.
