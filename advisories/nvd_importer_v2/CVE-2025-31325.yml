summary: Due to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver (ABAP Keyword Documentation),
  an unauthenticated attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a web page through an unprotected

  providing the attacker limited access to restricted information. The vulnerability does not

  browser.
