aliases: []
summary: wger is a free, open-source workout and fitness manager. In versions up to and including
  2.4, three `nutritional_values` action endpoints fetch objects via `Model.objects.get(pk=pk)`
  — a raw ORM call that bypasses the user-scoped queryset. Any authenticated user can read another
  user's private nutrition plan data, including caloric intake and full macro breakdown, by
  supplying an arbitrary PK. Commit 29876a1954fe959e4b58ef070170e81703dab60e contains a fix
  for the issue.
