aliases: []
summary: Multiple interpretation error in CAT-QuickHeal 8.0 allows remote attackers to bypass
  virus scanning via a file such as BAT, HTML, and EML with an "MZ" magic byte sequence which
  is normally associated with EXE, which causes the file to be treated as a safe type that could
  still be executed as a dangerous file type by applications on the end system, as demonstrated
  by a "triple headed" program that contains EXE, EML, and HTML content, aka the "magic byte
  bug."
