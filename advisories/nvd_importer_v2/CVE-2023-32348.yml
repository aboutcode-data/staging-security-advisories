aliases: []
summary: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a virtual private
  network (VPN) hub feature for cross-device communication that uses OpenVPN. It connects new
  devices in a manner that allows the new device to communicate with all Teltonika devices connected
  to the VPN. The OpenVPN server also allows users to route through it. An attacker could route
  a connection to a remote server through the OpenVPN server, enabling them to scan and access
  data from other Teltonika devices connected to the VPN.
