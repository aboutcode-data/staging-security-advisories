aliases: []
summary: The settings of the iQ Block Country WordPress plugin before 1.2.13 can be exported
  or imported using its backup functionality. An authorized user can import preconfigured settings
  of the plugin by uploading a zip file. After the uploading process, files in the uploaded
  zip file are extracted one by one. During the extraction process, existence of a file is checked.
  If the file exists, it is deleted without any security control by only considering the name
  of the extracted file. This behavior leads to "Zip Slip" vulnerability.
