aliases: []
summary: Apache Calcite 1.22.0 introduced the SQL operators EXISTS_NODE, EXTRACT_XML, XML_TRANSFORM
  and EXTRACT_VALUE do not restrict XML External Entity references in their configuration, making
  them vulnerable to a potential XML External Entity (XXE) attack. Therefore any client exposing
  these operators, typically by using Oracle dialect (the first three) or MySQL dialect (the
  last one), is affected by this vulnerability (the extent of it will depend on the user under
  which the application is running). From Apache Calcite 1.32.0 onwards, Document Type Declarations
  and XML External Entity resolution are disabled on the impacted operators.
