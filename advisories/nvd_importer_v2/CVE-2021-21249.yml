aliases: []
summary: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is an
  issue involving YAML parsing which can lead to post-auth remote code execution. In order to
  parse and process YAML files, OneDev uses SnakeYaml which by default (when not using `SafeConstructor`)
  allows the instantiation of arbitrary classes. We can leverage that to run arbitrary code
  by instantiating classes such as `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` and using `URLClassLoader`
  to load the script engine provider, resulting in the instantiation of a user controlled class.
  For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by only
  allowing certain known classes to be deserialized
