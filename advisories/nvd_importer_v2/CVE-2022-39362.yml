summary: Metabase is data visualization software. Prior to versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7,
  1.43.7, 0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9, unsaved SQL queries are auto-executed, which could
  pose a possible attack vector. This issue is patched in versions 0.44.5, 1.44.5, 0.43.7, 1.43.7,
  0.42.6, 1.42.6, 0.41.9, and 1.41.9. Metabase no longer automatically executes ad-hoc native
  queries. Now the native editor shows the query and gives the user the option to manually run
  the query if they want.
