aliases: []
summary: The Event post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized bulk metadata update
  due to a missing nonce check on the save_bulkdatas function in all versions up to, and including,
  5.9.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update post_meta_data via a
  forged request, granted they can trick a logged-in user into performing an action such as
  clicking on a link.
