aliases: []
summary: Astro is a web framework. In versions 9.0.0 through 9.5.3, a bug in Astro's image pipeline
  allows bypassing `image.domains` / `image.remotePatterns` restrictions, enabling the server
  to fetch content from unauthorized remote hosts. Astro provides an `inferSize` option that
  fetches remote images at render time to determine their dimensions. Remote image fetches are
  intended to be restricted to domains the site developer has manually authorized (using the
  `image.domains` or `image.remotePatterns` options). However, when `inferSize` is used, no
  domain validation is performed — the image is fetched from any host regardless of the configured
  restrictions. An attacker who can influence the image URL (e.g., via CMS content or user-supplied
  data) can cause the server to fetch from arbitrary hosts. This allows bypassing `image.domains`
  / `image.remotePatterns` restrictions to make server-side requests to unauthorized hosts.
  This includes the risk of server-side request forgery (SSRF) against internal network services
  and cloud metadata endpoints. Version 9.5.4 fixes the issue.
