aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Keylime, a remote attestation solution, where strict type checking
  introduced in version 7.12.0 prevents the registrar from reading database entries created
  by previous versions, for example, 7.11.0. Specifically, older versions store agent registration
  data as bytes, whereas the updated registrar expects str. This issue leads to an exception
  when processing agent registration requests, causing the agent to fail.
