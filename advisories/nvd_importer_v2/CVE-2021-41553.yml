aliases: []
summary: 'In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), the Web Application in /archibus/login.axvw
  assign a session token that could be already in use by another user. It was therefore possible
  to access the application through a user whose credentials were not known, without any attempt
  by the testers to modify the application logic. It is also possible to set the value of the
  session token, client-side, simply by making an unauthenticated GET Request to the Home Page
  and adding an arbitrary value to the JSESSIONID field. The application, following the login,
  does not assign a new token, continuing to keep the inserted one, as the identifier of the
  entire session. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability
  only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially
  de-supported by the end of 2020'
