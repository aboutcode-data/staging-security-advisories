summary: FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. In versions 1.26.1 and below, an
  authenticated administrator user can execute arbitrary code on the FreshRSS server by modifying
  the update URL to one they control, and gain code execution after running an update. After
  successfully executing code, user data including hashed passwords can be exfiltrated, the
  instance can be defaced when file permissions allow. Malicious code can be inserted into the
  instance to steal plaintext passwords, among others. This is fixed in version 1.26.2.
