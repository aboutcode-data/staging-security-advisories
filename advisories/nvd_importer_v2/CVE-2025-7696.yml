aliases: []
summary: The Integration for Pipedrive and Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Ninja Forms plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including,
  1.2.3 via deserialization of untrusted input within the verify_field_val() function. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence
  of a POP chain in the Contact Form 7 plugin, which is likely to be used alongside, allows
  attackers to delete arbitrary files, leading to a denial of service or remote code execution
  when the wp-config.php file is deleted.
