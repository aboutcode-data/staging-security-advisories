summary: The Video Share VOD – Turnkey Video Site Builder Script plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'videowhisper_player_html' shortcode in all
  versions up to, and including, 2.6.30 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping

  accesses an injected page.
