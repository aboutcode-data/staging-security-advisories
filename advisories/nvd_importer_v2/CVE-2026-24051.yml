aliases: []
summary: OpenTelemetry-Go is the Go implementation of OpenTelemetry. The OpenTelemetry Go SDK
  in version v1.20.0-1.39.0 is vulnerable to Path Hijacking (Untrusted Search Paths) on macOS/Darwin
  systems. The resource detection code in sdk/resource/host_id.go executes the ioreg system
  command using a search path. An attacker with the ability to locally modify the PATH environment
  variable can achieve Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) within the context of the application.
  A fix was released with v1.40.0.
