aliases: []
summary: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the
  Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `get_configuration_file()` function
  within the `transformers.configuration_utils` module. The affected version is 4.49.0, and
  the issue is resolved in version 4.51.0. The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular
  expression pattern `config\.(.*)\.json` that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption
  through crafted input strings, leading to catastrophic backtracking. This can result in model
  serving disruption, resource exhaustion, and increased latency in applications using the library.
