summary: "A flaw in the binding process of Govee’s cloud platform and devices allows a remote\
  \ attacker to bind an existing, online Govee device to the attacker’s account, resulting in\
  \ full control of the device and removal of the device from its legitimate owner’s account.\n\
  The server‑side API allows device association using a set of identifiers: \"device\", \"sku\"\
  , \"type\", and a client‑computed \"value\", that are not cryptographically bound to a secret\
  \ originating from the device itself.\n\nThe vulnerability has been verified for the Govee\
  \ H6056 - lamp device in firmware version 1.08.13, but may affect also other Govee cloud‑connected\
  \ devices. The vendor is investigating other potentially affected models.\n\nThe vendor has\
  \ deployed server-side security enhancements and automatic firmware updates for model H6056.\
  \ Most of H6056 devices have been successfully patched through automatic updates. Remaining\
  \ H6056 users with upgradeable hardware versions must manually update firmware through the\
  \ Govee Home app while keeping their device WiFi-connected. Users should open the Govee Home\
  \ app, tap their H6056 device card to enter the device details page, tap the settings icon\
  \ in the upper right corner, navigate to Device Information section (Firmware Version), and\
  \ tap the Update button to install the security patch immediately.\n \nGovee H6056 devices\
  \ with hardware versions 1.00.10 or 1.00.11 cannot receive firmware update due to hardware\
  \ limitations."
