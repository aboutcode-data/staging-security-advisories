summary: vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox
  escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected
  creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor
  can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running
  the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users
  are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
