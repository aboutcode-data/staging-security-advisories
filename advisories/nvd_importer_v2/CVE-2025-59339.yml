aliases: []
summary: The Bastion provides authentication, authorization, traceability and auditability for
  SSH accesses. Session-recording ttyrec files, may be handled by the provided osh-encrypt-rsync
  script that is a helper to rotate, encrypt, sign, copy, and optionally move them to a remote
  storage periodically, if configured to. When running, the script properly rotates and encrypts
  the files using the provided GPG key(s), but silently fails to sign them, even if asked to.
