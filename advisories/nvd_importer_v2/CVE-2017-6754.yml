aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco Smart Net Total
  Care (SNTC) Software Collector Appliance 3.11 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker
  to perform a read-only, blind SQL injection attack, which could allow the attacker to compromise
  the confidentiality of the system through SQL timing attacks. The vulnerability is due to
  insufficient input validation of certain user-supplied fields that are subsequently used by
  the affected software to build SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  submitting crafted URLs, which are designed to exploit the vulnerability, to the affected
  software. To execute an attack successfully, the attacker would need to submit a number of
  requests to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine
  the presence of values in the SQL database of the affected software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf07617.'
