  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  cifs: Fix memory and information leak in smb3_reconfigure()

  In smb3_reconfigure(), if smb3_sync_session_ctx_passwords() fails, the
  function returns immediately without freeing and erasing the newly
  allocated new_password and new_password2. This causes both a memory leak
  and a potential information leak.

  Fix this by calling kfree_sensitive() on both password buffers before
  returning in this error case.
