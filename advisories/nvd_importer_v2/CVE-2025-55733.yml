summary: 'DeepChat is a smart assistant that connects powerful AI to your personal world.  DeepChat
  before 0.3.1 has a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit
  this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted deepchat: URL on any website, including
  a malicious one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the
  browser triggers the app’s custom URL handler (deepchat:), causing the DeepChat application
  to launch and process the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This
  vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.1.'
