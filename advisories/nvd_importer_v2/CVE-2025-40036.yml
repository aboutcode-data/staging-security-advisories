  misc: fastrpc: fix possible map leak in fastrpc_put_args

  copy_to_user() failure would cause an early return without cleaning up
  the fdlist, which has been updated by the DSP. This could lead to map
  leak. Fix this by redirecting to a cleanup path on failure, ensuring
  that all mapped buffers are properly released before returning.
