aliases: []
summary: An unhandled exception vulnerability exists during Google Sign-In with Google API C++
  Client before 2019-04-10. It potentially causes an outage of third-party services that were
  not designed to recover from exceptions. On the client, ID token handling can cause an unhandled
  exception because of misinterpretation of an integer as a string, resulting in denial-of-service
  and then other users can no longer login/sign-in to the affected third-party service. Once
  this third-party service uses Google Sign-In with google-api-cpp-client, a malicious user
  can trigger this client/auth/oauth2_authorization.cc vulnerability by requesting the client
  to receive the ID token from a Google authentication server.
