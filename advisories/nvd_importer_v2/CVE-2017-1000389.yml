summary: 'Some URLs provided by Jenkins global-build-stats plugin version 1.4 and earlier returned
  a JSON response that contained request parameters. These responses had the Content Type: text/html,
  so could have been interpreted as HTML by clients, resulting in a potential reflected cross-site
  scripting vulnerability. Additionally, some URLs provided by global-build-stats plugin that
  modify data did not require POST requests to be sent, resulting in a potential cross-site
  request forgery vulnerability.'
