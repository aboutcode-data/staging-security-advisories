aliases: []
summary: An Unquoted Search Path vulnerability has been identified in the utility for Moxa’s
  industrial computers (Windows). Due to the unquoted path configuration in the SerialInterfaceService.exe
  utility, a local attacker with limited privileges could place a malicious executable in a
  higher-priority directory within the search path. When the Serial Interface service starts,
  the malicious executable could be run with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation could
  allow privilege escalation or enable an attacker to maintain persistence on the affected system.
  While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  of the affected device itself, there is no loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability
  within any subsequent systems.
