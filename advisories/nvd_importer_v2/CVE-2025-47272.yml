aliases: []
summary: The CE Phoenix eCommerce platform, starting in version 1.0.9.7 and prior to version
  1.1.0.3, allowed logged-in users to delete their accounts without requiring password re-authentication.
  An attacker with temporary access to an authenticated session (e.g., on a shared/public machine)
  could permanently delete the user’s account without knowledge of the password. This bypass
  of re-authentication puts users at risk of account loss and data disruption. Version 1.1.0.3
  contains a patch for the issue.
