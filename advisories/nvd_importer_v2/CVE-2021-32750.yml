aliases: []
summary: MuWire is a file publishing and networking tool that protects the identity of its users
  by using I2P technology. Users of MuWire desktop client prior to version 0.8.8 can be de-anonymized
  by an attacker who knows their full ID. An attacker could send a message with a subject line
  containing a URL with an HTML image tag and the MuWire client would try to fetch that image
  via clearnet, thus exposing the IP address of the user. The problem is fixed in MuWire 0.8.8.
  As a workaround, users can disable messaging functionality to prevent other users from sending
  them malicious messages.
