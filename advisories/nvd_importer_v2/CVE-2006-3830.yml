aliases: []
summary: 'The Languages selection in the admin interface in Kailash Nadh boastMachine (formerly
  bMachine) 3.1 and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators to upload files with
  arbitrary extensions to the bmc/Inc/Lang directory.  NOTE: because the uploaded files cannot
  be accessed through HTTP, this issue is a vulnerability only if there is a likely usage pattern
  in which the files would be opened or executed by local users, e.g., malware files with names
  that entice local users to open the files.'
