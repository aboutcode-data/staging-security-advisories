aliases: []
summary: The Nari Accountant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via account settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.12 due to insufficient input
  sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
  whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
  installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
