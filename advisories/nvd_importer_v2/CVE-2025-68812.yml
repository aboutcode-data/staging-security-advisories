aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: iris: Add sanity check for stop streaming

  Add sanity check in iris_vb2_stop_streaming. If inst->state is
  already IRIS_INST_ERROR, we should skip the stream_off operation
  because it would still send packets to the firmware.

  In iris_kill_session, inst->state is set to IRIS_INST_ERROR and
  session_close is executed, which will kfree(inst_hfi_gen2->packet).
  If stop_streaming is called afterward, it will cause a crash.
