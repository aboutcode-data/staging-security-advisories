aliases: []
summary: 'Crayfish is a collection of Islandora 8 microservices, one of which, Homarus, provides
  FFmpeg as a microservice. Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible
  in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched
  in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making
  a request against the Homarus''s `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is
  much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent
  general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure
  auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers
  that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.'
