aliases: []
summary: The Strong Testimonials plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.16. This is due to the software allowing users to
  submit a testimonial in which a value is not properly validated or sanitized prior to being
  passed to a do_shortcode call. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute
  arbitrary shortcodes if an administrator previews or publishes a crafted testimonial.
