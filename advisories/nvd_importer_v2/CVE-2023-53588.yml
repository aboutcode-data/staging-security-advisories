summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mac80211: check for station first in client probe

  When probing a client, first check if we have it, and then
  check for the channel context, otherwise you can trigger
  the warning there easily by probing when the AP isn't even
  started yet. Since a client existing means the AP is also
  operating, we can then keep the warning.

  Also simplify the moved code a bit.
