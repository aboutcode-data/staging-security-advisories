aliases: []
summary: Composer before 2016-02-10 allows cache poisoning from other projects built on the
  same host. This results in attacker-controlled code entering a server-side build process.
  The issue occurs because of the way that dist packages are cached. The cache key is derived
  from the package name, the dist type, and certain other data from the package repository (which
  may simply be a commit hash, and thus can be found by an attacker). Versions through 1.0.0-alpha11
  are affected, and 1.0.0 is unaffected.
