  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  btrfs: fix NULL dereference on root when tracing inode eviction

  When evicting an inode the first thing we do is to setup tracing for it,
  which implies fetching the root's id. But in btrfs_evict_inode() the
  root might be NULL, as implied in the next check that we do in
  btrfs_evict_inode().

  Hence, we either should set the ->root_objectid to 0 in case the root is
  NULL, or we move tracing setup after checking that the root is not
  NULL. Setting the rootid to 0 at least gives us the possibility to trace
  this call even in the case when the root is NULL, so that's the solution
  taken here.
