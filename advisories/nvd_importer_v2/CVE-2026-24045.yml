aliases: []
summary: Docmost is open-source collaborative wiki and documentation software. From g and before
  0.25.0, the public share page functionality in Docmost does not properly HTML-escape page
  titles before inserting them into meta tags and the title tag. This allows Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context
  of any user who opens a shared page link. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.25.0.
