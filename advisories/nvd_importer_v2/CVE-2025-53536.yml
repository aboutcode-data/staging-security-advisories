aliases: []
summary: Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to 3.22.6, if the victim had
  "Write" auto-approved, an attacker with the ability to submit prompts to the agent could write
  to VS Code settings files and trigger code execution. There were multiple ways to achieve
  that. One example is with the php.validate.executablePath setting which lets you set the path
  for the php executable for syntax validation. The attacker could have written the path to
  an arbitrary command there and then created a php file to trigger it. This vulnerability is
  fixed in 3.22.6.
