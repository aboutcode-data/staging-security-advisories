aliases: []
summary: GoCD is a continuous deliver server. GoCD versions 18.9.0 through 24.4.0 (inclusive)
  can allow GoCD admins to abuse the backup configuration "post-backup script" feature to potentially
  execute arbitrary scripts on the hosting server or container as GoCD's user, rather than pre-configured
  scripts. In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, as in most configurations
  a user who can log into the GoCD UI as an admin also has host administration permissions for
  the host/container that GoCD runs on, in order to manage artifact storage and other service-level
  configuration options. Additionally, since a GoCD admin has ability to configure and schedule
  pipelines tasks on all GoCD agents available to the server, the fundamental functionality
  of GoCD allows co-ordinated task execution similar to that of post-backup-scripts. However
  in restricted environments where the host administration is separated from the role of a GoCD
  admin, this may be unexpected. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. Post-backup scripts can
  no longer be executed from within certain sensitive locations on the GoCD server. No known
  workarounds are available.
