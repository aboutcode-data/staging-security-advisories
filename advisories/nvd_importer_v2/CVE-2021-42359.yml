aliases: []
summary: WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, ‘admin-dismiss-unsubscribe‘, which
  lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and
  did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible
  for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an
  AJAX request with the “action” parameter set to “admin-dismiss-unsubscribe” and the “id” parameter
  set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and
  repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.
