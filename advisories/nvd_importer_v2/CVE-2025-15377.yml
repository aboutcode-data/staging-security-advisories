aliases: []
summary: The Sosh Share Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  'admin_page_content' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
