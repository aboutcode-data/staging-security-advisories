aliases: []
summary: 'Formbricks is an open source qualtrics alternative. Prior to version 4.0.1, Formbricks
  is missing JWT signature verification. This vulnerability stems from a token validation routine
  that only decodes JWTs (jwt.decode) without verifying their signatures. Both the email verification
  token login path and the password reset server action use the same validator, which does not
  check the token’s signature, expiration, issuer, or audience. If an attacker learns the victim’s
  actual user.id, they can craft an arbitrary JWT with an alg: "none" header and use it to authenticate
  and reset the victim’s password. This issue has been patched in version 4.0.1.'
