summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite
  model that would cause a write outside of bounds of an array in TFLite. In fact, the attacker
  can override the linked list used by the memory allocator. This can be leveraged for an arbitrary
  write primitive under certain conditions. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range.
