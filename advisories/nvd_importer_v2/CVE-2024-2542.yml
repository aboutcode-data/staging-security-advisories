aliases: []
summary: The Jotform Online Forms – Drag & Drop Form Builder, Securely Embed Contact Forms plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode(s) in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. CVE-2024-32527 is likely a duplicate of
  this issue.
