aliases: []
summary: The HTMLSectionSplitter class in langchain-text-splitters version 0.3.8 is vulnerable
  to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to unsafe XSLT parsing. This vulnerability arises
  because the class allows the use of arbitrary XSLT stylesheets, which are parsed using lxml.etree.parse()
  and lxml.etree.XSLT() without any hardening measures. In lxml versions up to 4.9.x, external
  entities are resolved by default, allowing attackers to read arbitrary local files or perform
  outbound HTTP(S) fetches. In lxml versions 5.0 and above, while entity expansion is disabled,
  the XSLT document() function can still read any URI unless XSLTAccessControl is applied. This
  vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain read-only access to any file the LangChain process
  can reach, including sensitive files such as SSH keys, environment files, source code, or
  cloud metadata. No authentication, special privileges, or user interaction are required, and
  the issue is exploitable in default deployments that enable custom XSLT.
