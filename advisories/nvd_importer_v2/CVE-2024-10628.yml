aliases: []
summary: 'The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable
  to SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business),
  up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to
  insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on
  the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database. NOTE: The three variations of this software (Business, Developer, and Agency)
  share the same plugin slug, so you may get an alert even if you are running the latest version
  of any of the pieces of software. In these cases it is safe to dismiss the notice once you''ve
  confirmed your site is on a patched version of the applicable software.'
