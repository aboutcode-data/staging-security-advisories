aliases: []
summary: The Spirit Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.2.14. This is due to the custom_actions() function not
  properly validating a user's identity prior to authenticating them to the site. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators,
  granted they have access to the administrator's username.
