aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the Keycloak organization feature, which allows the incorrect assignment
  of an organization to a user if their username or email matches the organization’s domain
  pattern. This issue occurs at the mapper level, leading to misrepresentation in tokens. If
  an application relies on these claims for authorization, it may incorrectly assume a user
  belongs to an organization they are not a member of, potentially granting unauthorized access
  or privileges.
