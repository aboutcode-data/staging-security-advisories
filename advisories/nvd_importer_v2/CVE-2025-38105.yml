  ALSA: usb-audio: Kill timer properly at removal

  The USB-audio MIDI code initializes the timer, but in a rare case, the
  driver might be freed without the disconnect call.  This leaves the
  timer in an active state while the assigned object is released via
  snd_usbmidi_free(), which ends up with a kernel warning when the debug
  configuration is enabled, as spotted by fuzzer.

  For avoiding the problem, put timer_shutdown_sync() at
  snd_usbmidi_free(), so that the timer can be killed properly.
  While we're at it, replace the existing timer_delete_sync() at the
  disconnect callback with timer_shutdown_sync(), too.
