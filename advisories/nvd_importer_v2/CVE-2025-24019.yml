aliases: []
summary: YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it
  is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file
  owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation
  on the filesystem's scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily
  remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration
  of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification,
  the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running
  the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner
  of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting
  all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains
  a patch for this issue.
