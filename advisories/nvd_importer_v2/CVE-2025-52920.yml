aliases: []
summary: Innoshop through 0.4.1 allows Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) at multiple places
  within the frontend shop. Anyone can create a customer account and easily exploit these. Successful
  exploitation results in disclosure of the PII of other customers and the deletion of their
  reviews of products on the website. To be specific, an attacker could view the order details
  of any order by browsing to /en/account/orders/_ORDER_ID_ or use the address and billing information
  of other customers by manipulating the shipping_address_id and billing_address_id parameters
  when making an order (this information is then reflected in the receipt). Additionally, an
  attacker could delete the reviews of other users by sending a DELETE request to /en/account/reviews/_REVIEW_ID.
