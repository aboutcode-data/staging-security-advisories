summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration
  Assurance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system. The vulnerability
  is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected

  to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser
  to perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the user on an affected system.
