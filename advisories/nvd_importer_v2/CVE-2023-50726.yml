aliases: []
summary: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. "Local sync"
  is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests
  with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted
  users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git. An improper validation
  bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local
  manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still
  enforced. The only restriction which is not enforced is that the manifests come from some
  approved git/Helm/OCI source. The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest
  sync feature was added. The bug has been patched in Argo CD versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the risk of branch protection
  bypass by removing `applications, create` RBAC access. The only way to eliminate the issue
  without removing RBAC access is to upgrade to a patched version.
