summary: A vulnerability in the TFTP service of Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series
  software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from
  the targeted device, possibly resulting in information disclosure. The vulnerability is due
  to improper validation of user-supplied input within TFTP requests processed by the affected
  software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques
  in malicious requests sent to the TFTP service on a targeted device. An exploit could allow
  the attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the targeted device, resulting in the disclosure
  of sensitive information. This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software releases prior
  to Release 6.5.2 for Cisco Network Convergence System 1000 Series devices when the TFTP service
  is enabled.
