summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with
  the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the
  current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised
  to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.
