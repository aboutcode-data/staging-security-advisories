aliases: []
summary: 'JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might
  falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method
  within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class.
  NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the "ignores" behavior cannot occur (in any version)
  unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually
  tested must have been more than six years out of date.'
