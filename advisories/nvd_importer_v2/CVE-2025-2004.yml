aliases: []
summary: The Simple WP Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to insufficient file path validation in the wpe_delete_file AJAX action in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.8.17. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete
  arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
  file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
