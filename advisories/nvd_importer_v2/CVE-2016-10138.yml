aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered on BLU Advance 5.0 and BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups
  software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled
  by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app''s AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId
  attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which
  is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named
  com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with.
  Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the
  WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third-party app,
  utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a phone number,
  factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video, install
  applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService
  component will make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where
  the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server
  will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable
  to a MITM attack.'
