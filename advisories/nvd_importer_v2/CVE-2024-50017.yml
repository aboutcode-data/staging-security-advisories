summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/mm/ident_map: Use gbpages only where full GB page should be mapped.

  When ident_pud_init() uses only GB pages to create identity maps, large
  ranges of addresses not actually requested can be included in the resulting
  table; a 4K request will map a full GB.  This can include a lot of extra
  address space past that requested, including areas marked reserved by the
  BIOS.  That allows processor speculation into reserved regions, that on UV
  systems can cause system halts.

  Only use GB pages when map creation requests include the full GB page of
  space.  Fall back to using smaller 2M pages when only portions of a GB page
  are included in the request.

  No attempt is made to coalesce mapping requests. If a request requires a
  map entry at the 2M (pmd) level, subsequent mapping requests within the
  same 1G region will also be at the pmd level, even if adjacent or
  overlapping such requests could have been combined to map a full GB page.
  Existing usage starts with larger regions and then adds smaller regions, so
  this should not have any great consequence.
