aliases: []
summary: In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform
  versions below 9.1.2312.109, an attacker could determine whether or not another user exists
  on the instance by deciphering the error response that they would likely receive from the
  instance when they attempt to log in. This disclosure could then lead to additional brute-force
  password-guessing attacks. This vulnerability would require that the Splunk platform instance
  uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication scheme.
