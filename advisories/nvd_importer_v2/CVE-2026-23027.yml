  LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_pch_pic_destroy()

  In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated memory,
  kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device
  struct, but kvm_pch_pic_destroy() is not currently doing this, that
  would lead to a memory leak.

  So, fix it.
