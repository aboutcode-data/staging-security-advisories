summary: The WPC Order Notes for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.2. This is due to missing or incorrect

  attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site
  administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
