summary: The Simple Ajax Chat – Add a Fast, Secure Chat Box plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 20231101
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated

  in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site
  installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
