summary: "SummaryA Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary\
  \ JavaScript in the context of another user’s session. This occurs because user-supplied input\
  \ is reflected back in the server’s response without proper sanitization or escaping, potentially\
  \ enabling malicious actions such as session hijacking, credential theft, or unauthorized\
  \ actions in the application.\n\nDetailsThe vulnerability resides in the “Tags” input field\
  \ on the /s/ajax?action=lead:addLeadTags endpoint. Although the server applies sanitization\
  \ before storing the data or returning it later, the payload is executed immediately in the\
  \ victim’s browser upon reflection, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript in the\
  \ user’s session.\n\nImpactA Reflected XSS attack can have a significant impact, allowing\
  \ attackers to steal sensitive user data like cookies, redirect users to malicious websites,\
  \ manipulate the web page content, and essentially take control of a user's session within\
  \ an application by executing malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser, even\
  \ if the server-side code is secure; essentially enabling them to perform actions as if they\
  \ were the logged-in user.\n\nReferences  *   Web Security Academy: Cross-site scripting https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting\
