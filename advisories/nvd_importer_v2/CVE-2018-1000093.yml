aliases: []
summary: CryptoNote version version 0.8.9 and possibly later contain a local RPC server which
  does not require authentication, as a result the walletd and the simplewallet RPC daemons
  will process any commands sent to them, resulting in remote command execution and a takeover
  of the cryptocurrency wallet if an attacker can trick an application such as a web browser
  into connecting and sending a command for example. This attack appears to be exploitable via
  a victim visiting a webpage hosting malicious content that trigger such behavior.
