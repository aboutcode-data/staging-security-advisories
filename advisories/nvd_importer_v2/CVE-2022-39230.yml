aliases: []
summary: fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart is an implementation of the authorization interface from
  the FHIR Works interface. Versions 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are subject to Exposure of Sensitive Information
  to an Unauthorized Actor. This issue allows a client of the API to retrieve more information
  than the client’s OAuth scope permits when making “search-type” requests. This issue would
  not allow a client to retrieve information about individuals other than those the client was
  already authorized to access. Users of fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 should
  upgrade to version 3.1.3 or higher immediately. Versions 3.1.0 and below are unaffected. There
  is no workaround for this issue.
