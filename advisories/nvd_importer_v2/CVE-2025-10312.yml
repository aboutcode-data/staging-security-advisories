aliases: []
summary: The Theme Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation when processing
  form submissions in the theme-importer.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to trigger arbitrary file downloads and potentially execute malicious operations
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
