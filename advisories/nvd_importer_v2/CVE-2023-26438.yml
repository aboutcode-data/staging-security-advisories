aliases: []
summary: External service lookups for a number of protocols were vulnerable to a time-of-check/time-of-use
  (TOCTOU) weakness, involving the JDK DNS cache. Attackers that were timing DNS cache expiry
  correctly were able to inject configuration that would bypass existing network deny-lists.
  Attackers could exploit this weakness to discover the existence of restricted network infrastructure
  and service availability. Improvements were made to include deny-lists not only during the
  check of the provided connection data, but also during use. No publicly available exploits
  are known.
