  bpf: Guard stack limits against 32bit overflow

  This patch promotes the arithmetic around checking stack bounds to be
  done in the 64-bit domain, instead of the current 32bit. The arithmetic
  implies adding together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The
  register was checked to be below 1<<29 when it was variable, but not
  when it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in which
  case it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller
  checked it to be below 1<<29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a
  kfunc (in which case it can be a u32 [2]). Between the register being
  inconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset being up to an
  u32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were
  currently used for arithmetic.
