aliases: []
summary: 'The Gutenberg plugin through 13.7.3 for WordPress allows stored XSS by the Contributor
  role via an SVG document to the "Insert from URL" feature. NOTE: the XSS payload does not
  execute in the context of the WordPress instance''s domain; however, analogous attempts by
  low-privileged users to reference SVG documents are blocked by some similar products, and
  this behavioral difference might have security relevance to some WordPress site administrators.'
