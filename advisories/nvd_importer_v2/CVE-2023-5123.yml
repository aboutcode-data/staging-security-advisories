aliases: []
summary: "The JSON datasource plugin ( https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/\
  \ ) is a Grafana Labs maintained plugin for Grafana that allows for retrieving and processing\
  \ JSON data from a remote endpoint (including a specific sub-path) configured by an administrator.\
  \ Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible\
  \ to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths\
  \ on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path. \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n   \
  \         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n            This means that if the datasource was configured\
  \ by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/\
  \ ), it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which\
  \ issues queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn cause the datasource\
  \ to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/)\
  \ .\n\nIn the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at\
  \ the Grafana instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe, as an\
  \ administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests\
  \ to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials, resulting in the potential\
  \ for privilege escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability."
