aliases: []
summary: Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things
  devices. In verions prior to 4.6, an attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack by triggering
  an infinite loop in the processing of IPv6 neighbor solicitation (NS) messages. This type
  of attack can effectively shut down the operation of the system because of the cooperative
  scheduling used for the main parts of Contiki-NG and its communication stack. The problem
  has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band
  as a workaround.
