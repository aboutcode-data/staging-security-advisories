aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the Fence Agents Remediation operator. This vulnerability can allow
  a Remote Code Execution (RCE) primitive by supplying an arbitrary command to execute in the
  --ssh-path/--telnet-path arguments. A low-privilege user, for example, a user with developer
  access, can create a specially crafted FenceAgentsRemediation for a fence agent supporting 
  --ssh-path/--telnet-path arguments to execute arbitrary commands on the operator's pod. This
  RCE leads to a privilege escalation, first as the service account running the operator, then
  to another service account with cluster-admin privileges.
