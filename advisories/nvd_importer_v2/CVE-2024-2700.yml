aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment
  variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the
  resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables
  may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping
  the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed
  certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility,
  they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the
  application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties
  from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.
