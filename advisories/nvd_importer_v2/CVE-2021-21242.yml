aliases: []
summary: OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a
  critical vulnerability which can lead to pre-auth remote code execution. AttachmentUploadServlet
  deserializes untrusted data from the `Attachment-Support` header. This Servlet does not enforce
  any authentication or authorization checks. This issue may lead to pre-auth remote code execution.
  This issue was fixed in 4.0.3 by removing AttachmentUploadServlet and not using deserialization
