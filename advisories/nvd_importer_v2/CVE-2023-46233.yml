aliases: []
summary: crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0, crypto-js
  PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times
  weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic
  hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration,
  a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies
  on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect
  passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version
  4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256
  with at least 250,000 iterations.
