aliases: []
summary: NordVPN 3.3.10 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The
  vulnerability stems from its privileged helper tool's implemented XPC service. This XPC service
  is responsible for receiving and processing new OpenVPN connection requests from the main
  application. Unfortunately this XPC service is not protected, which allows arbitrary applications
  to connect and send it XPC messages. An attacker can send a crafted XPC message to the privileged
  helper tool requesting it make a new OpenVPN connection. Because he or she controls the contents
  of the XPC message, the attacker can specify the location of the openvpn executable, which
  could point to something malicious they control located on disk. Without validation of the
  openvpn executable, this will give the attacker code execution in the context of the privileged
  helper tool.
