aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. Several of the scripts perform dynamic
  script inclusion via the include() function on user supplied input without sanitizing the
  values by calling basename() or a similar function. An attacker can leverage this to execute
  PHP code from the included file. Exploitation of these scripts is made difficult by additional
  text being appended (typically .inc.php), which means an attacker would need to be able to
  control both a filename and its content on the server. However, exploitation can be achieved
  as demonstrated by the csv.php?report=../ substring.
