summary: 'Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in Winter CMS v.1.2.3 allows a
  remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the CMS Pages field and
  Plugin components. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the payload could only be entered
  by a trusted user, such as the owner of the server that hosts Winter CMS, or a developer working
  for them.'
