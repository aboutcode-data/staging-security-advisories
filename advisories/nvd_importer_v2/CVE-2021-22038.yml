aliases: []
summary: On Windows, the uninstaller binary copies itself to a fixed temporary location, which
  is then executed (the originally called uninstaller exits, so it does not block the installation
  directory). This temporary location is not randomized and does not restrict access to Administrators
  only so a potential attacker could plant a binary to replace the copied binary right before
  it gets called, thus gaining Administrator privileges (if the original uninstaller was executed
  as Administrator). The vulnerability only affects Windows installers.
