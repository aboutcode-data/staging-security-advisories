aliases: []
summary: The Advanced Advertising System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This is due to insufficient validation on the
  redirect url supplied via the 'redir' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick
  them into performing an action.
