aliases: []
summary: The Everest Forms (Pro) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_entry_files() function in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.9.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete
  arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
  file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). The vulnerability requires an admin to trigger the
  deletion via deletion of a form entry and cannot be carried out by the attacker alone.
