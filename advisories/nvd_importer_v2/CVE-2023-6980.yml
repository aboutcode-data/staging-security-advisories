summary: The WP SMS – Messaging & SMS Notification for WordPress, WooCommerce, GravityForms,
  etc plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to,
  and including, 6.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'delete' action

  subscribers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
