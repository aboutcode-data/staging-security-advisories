aliases: []
summary: Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol,
  when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to trigger
  unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client may
  cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim
  that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and
  validate the order of the public key.
