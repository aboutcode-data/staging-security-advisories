summary: The Astra Security Suite – Firewall & Malware Scan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient validation of remote URLs for zip downloads

  for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which
  may make remote code execution possible.
