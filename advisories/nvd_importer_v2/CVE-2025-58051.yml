summary: Nextcloud Tables allows you to create your own tables with individual columns. Prior

  and when their format is supported by the used PhpSpreadsheet library they would be included
  and their content leaked to the user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Tables app is upgraded
  to 0.7.6, 0.8.8 or 0.9.5.
