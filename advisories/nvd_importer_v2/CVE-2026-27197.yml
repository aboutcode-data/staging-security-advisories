aliases: []
summary: 'Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. Versions
  21.12.0 through 26.1.0 have a critical vulnerability in its SAML SSO implementation  which
  allows an attacker to take over any user account by using a malicious SAML Identity Provider
  and another organization on the same Sentry instance. Self-hosted users are only at risk if
  the following criteria is met: ore than one organizations are configured (SENTRY_SINGLE_ORGANIZATION
  = True), or malicious user has existing access and permissions to modify SSO settings for
  another organization in a multo-organization instance. This issue has been fixed in version
  26.2.0. To workaround this issue, implement user account-based two-factor authentication to
  prevent an attacker from being able to complete authentication with a victim''s user account.
  Organization administrators cannot do this on a user''s behalf, this requires individual users
  to ensure 2FA has been enabled for their account.'
