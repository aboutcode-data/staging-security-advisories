  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: bpf: abort dispatch if device destroyed

  The current HID bpf implementation assumes no output report/request will
  go through it after hid_bpf_destroy_device() has been called. This leads
  to a bug that unplugging certain types of HID devices causes a cleaned-
  up SRCU to be accessed. The bug was previously a hidden failure until a
  recent x86 percpu change [1] made it access not-present pages.

  The bug will be triggered if the conditions below are met:

  A) a device under the driver has some LEDs on
  B) hid_ll_driver->request() is uninplemented (e.g., logitech-djreceiver)

  If condition A is met, hidinput_led_worker() is always scheduled *after*
  hid_bpf_destroy_device().

  hid_destroy_device
  ` hid_bpf_destroy_device
    ` cleanup_srcu_struct(&hdev->bpf.srcu)
  ` hid_remove_device
    ` ...
      ` led_classdev_unregister
        ` led_trigger_set(led_cdev, NULL)
          ` led_set_brightness(led_cdev, LED_OFF)
            ` ...
              ` input_inject_event
                ` input_event_dispose
                  ` hidinput_input_event
                    ` schedule_work(&hid->led_work) [hidinput_led_worker]

  This is fine when condition B is not met, where hidinput_led_worker()
  calls hid_ll_driver->request(). This is the case for most HID drivers,
  which implement it or use the generic one from usbhid. The driver itself
  or an underlying driver will then abort processing the request.

  Otherwise, hidinput_led_worker() tries hid_hw_output_report() and leads
  to the bug.

  hidinput_led_worker
  ` hid_hw_output_report
    ` dispatch_hid_bpf_output_report
      ` srcu_read_lock(&hdev->bpf.srcu)
      ` srcu_read_unlock(&hdev->bpf.srcu, idx)

  The bug has existed since the introduction [2] of
  dispatch_hid_bpf_output_report(). However, the same bug also exists in
  dispatch_hid_bpf_raw_requests(), and I've reproduced (no visible effect
  because of the lack of [1], but confirmed bpf.destroyed == 1) the bug
  against the commit (i.e., the Fixes:) introducing the function. This is
  because hidinput_led_worker() falls back to hid_hw_raw_request() when
  hid_ll_driver->output_report() is uninplemented (e.g., logitech-
  djreceiver).

  hidinput_led_worker
  ` hid_hw_output_report: -ENOSYS
  ` hid_hw_raw_request
    ` dispatch_hid_bpf_raw_requests
      ` srcu_read_lock(&hdev->bpf.srcu)
      ` srcu_read_unlock(&hdev->bpf.srcu, idx)

  Fix the issue by returning early in the two mentioned functions if
  hid_bpf has been marked as destroyed. Though
  dispatch_hid_bpf_device_event() handles input events, and there is no
  evidence that it may be called after the destruction, the same check, as
  a safety net, is also added to it to maintain the consistency among all
  dispatch functions.

  The impact of the bug on other architectures is unclear. Even if it acts
  as a hidden failure, this is still dangerous because it corrupts
  whatever is on the address calculated by SRCU. Thus, CC'ing the stable
  list.
