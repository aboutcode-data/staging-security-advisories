aliases: []
summary: In Redgate SQL Monitor 7.1.4 through 10.1.6 (inclusive), the scope for disabling some
  TLS security certificate checks can extend beyond that defined by various options on the Configuration
  > Notifications pages to disable certificate checking for alert notifications. These TLS security
  checks are also ignored during monitoring of VMware machines. This would make SQL Monitor
  vulnerable to potential man-in-the-middle attacks when sending alert notification emails,
  posting to Slack or posting to webhooks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.1.7.
