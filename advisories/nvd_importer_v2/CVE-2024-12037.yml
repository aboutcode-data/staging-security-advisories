summary: The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content
  Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the plugin's 'bf_new_submission_link' shortcode in all versions up to, and including,
  2.8.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above,
  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
