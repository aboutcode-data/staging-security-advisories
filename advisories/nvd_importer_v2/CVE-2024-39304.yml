aliases: []
summary: ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Versions of the application prior
  to 5.9.2 are vulnerable to an authenticated SQL injection due to an improper sanitization
  of user input. Authentication is required, but no elevated privileges are necessary. This
  allows attackers to inject SQL statements directly into the database query due to inadequate
  sanitization of the EID parameter in in a GET request to `/GetText.php`. Version 5.9.2 patches
  the issue.
