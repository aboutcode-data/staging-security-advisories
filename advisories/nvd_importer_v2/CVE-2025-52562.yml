aliases: []
summary: Convoy is a KVM server management panel for hosting businesses. In versions 3.9.0-rc3
  to before 4.4.1, there is a directory traversal vulnerability in the LocaleController component
  of Performave Convoy. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by
  sending a specially crafted HTTP request with malicious locale and namespace parameters. This
  allows the attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server. This issue has
  been patched in version 4.4.1. A temporary workaround involves implementing strict Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) rules to incoming requests targeting the vulnerable endpoints.
