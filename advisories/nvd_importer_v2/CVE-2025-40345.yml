aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: storage: sddr55: Reject out-of-bound new_pba

  Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

  new_pba comes from the status packet returned after each write.
  A bogus device could report values beyond the block count derived
  from info->capacity, letting the driver walk off the end of
  pba_to_lba[] and corrupt heap memory.

  Reject PBAs that exceed the computed block count and fail the
  transfer so we avoid touching out-of-range mapping entries.
