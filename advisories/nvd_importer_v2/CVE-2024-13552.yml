summary: The SupportCandy – Helpdesk & Customer Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0
  via file upload due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers to download attachments for support tickets that don't belong
  to them. If an admin enables tickets for guests, this can be exploited by unauthenticated
  attackers.
