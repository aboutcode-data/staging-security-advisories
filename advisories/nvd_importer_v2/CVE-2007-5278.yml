summary: 'Zomplog 3.8.1 and earlier stores potentially sensitive information under the web root
  with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download files that were
  uploaded by users, as demonstrated by obtaining a directory listing via a direct request to
  /upload and then retrieving individual files.  NOTE: in a non-default configuration, the directory
  listing is denied, but filenames may be predicable.'
