aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in gradio-app/gradio, where the `/component_server` endpoint
  improperly allows the invocation of any method on a `Component` class with attacker-controlled
  arguments. Specifically, by exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the
  `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory and
  subsequently retrieve it. This vulnerability enables unauthorized local file read access,
  posing a significant risk especially when the application is exposed to the internet via `launch(share=True)`,
  thereby allowing remote attackers to read files on the host machine. Furthermore, gradio apps
  hosted on `huggingface.co` are also affected, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive
  information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables.
