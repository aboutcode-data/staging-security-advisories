aliases: []
summary: 'matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker
  cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from
  another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this
  may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the key forwarding strategy implemented
  in the matrix-android-sdk2 that is too permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default
  policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2. The
  matrix-android-sdk2 will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests
  and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message
  upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a
  trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted =
  false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages).
  As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable key forwarding in their forks using
  `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`.'
