aliases: []
summary: 'XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. It''s possible to get access to notification filters of any user by using
  a URL such as `<hostname>xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/Notifications/Code/NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults?outputSyntax=plain&type=custom&user=<username>`.
  This vulnerability impacts all versions of XWiki since 13.2-rc-1. The filters do not provide
  much information (they mainly contain references which are public data in XWiki), though some
  info could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities. This vulnerability has been
  patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.1, 16.0RC1.  The patch consists in checking the rights
  of the user when sending the data. Users are advised to upgrade. It''s possible to workaround
  the vulnerability by applying manually the patch: it''s possible for an administrator to edit
  directly the document `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults`
  to apply the same changes as in the patch. See commit c8c6545f9bde6f5aade994aa5b5903a67b5c2582.'
