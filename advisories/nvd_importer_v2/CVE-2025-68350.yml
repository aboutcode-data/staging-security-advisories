summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  exfat: fix divide-by-zero in exfat_allocate_bitmap

  The variable max_ra_count can be 0 in exfat_allocate_bitmap(),
  which causes a divide-by-zero error in the subsequent modulo operation
  (i % max_ra_count), leading to a system crash.
  When max_ra_count is 0, it means that readahead is not used. This patch
  load the bitmap without readahead.
