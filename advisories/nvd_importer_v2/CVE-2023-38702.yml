aliases: []
summary: Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite. Starting in the
  6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile`
  allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any
  authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect
  to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability,
  an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory
  and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version
  8.1.8.
