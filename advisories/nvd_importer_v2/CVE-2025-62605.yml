aliases: []
summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. In Mastodon
  version 4.4, support for verifiable quote posts with quote controls was added, but it is possible
  for an attacker to bypass these controls in Mastodon versions prior to 4.4.8 and 4.5.0-beta.2.
  Mastodon internally treats reblogs as statuses. Since they were not special-treated, an attacker
  could reblog any post, then quote their reblog, technically quoting themselves, but having
  the quote feature a preview of the post they did not get authorization for with all of the
  affordances that would be otherwise denied by the quote controls. This issue has been patched
  in versions 4.4.8 and 4.5.0-beta.2.
