aliases: []
summary: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the upload link feature
  of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This feature, intended for users with manager or admin roles,
  processes uploaded links through an internal Collector API using a headless browser. An attacker
  can exploit this by hosting a malicious website and using it to perform actions such as internal
  port scanning, accessing internal web applications not exposed externally, and interacting
  with the Collector API. This interaction can lead to unauthorized actions such as arbitrary
  file deletion and limited Local File Inclusion (LFI), including accessing NGINX access logs
  which may contain sensitive information.
