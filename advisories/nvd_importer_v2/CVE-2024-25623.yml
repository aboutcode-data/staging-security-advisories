aliases: []
summary: 'Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Prior
  to versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19, when fetching remote statuses, Mastodon doesn''t
  check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity
  Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document
  to a remote server and make a Mastodon server fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary
  user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate an account on a remote
  server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the attacker to register an
  account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as the
  ActivityPub actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept`
  header value of the Activity Streams media type. Versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19
  contain a fix for this issue.'
