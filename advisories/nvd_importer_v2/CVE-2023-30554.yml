aliases: []
summary: Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project contains multiple
  SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases.
  Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck`
  which passes unfiltered input to the `explain_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py`. User
  input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint
  is passed through the `oracle.py` `execute_check` method and to the `explain_check` method
  for execution. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared
  statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-103`.
