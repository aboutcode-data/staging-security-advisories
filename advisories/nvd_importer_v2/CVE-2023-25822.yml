aliases: []
summary: ReportPortal is an AI-powered test automation platform. Prior to version 5.10.0 of
  the `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module, corresponding to ReportPortal version 23.2,
  the ReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting almost fully stops except for small
  launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path field is exceeded the allowable
  `ltree` field type indexing limit (path length>=120, approximately recursive nesting of the
  nested steps). REINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx aren't helped. The problem was fixed
  in `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module version 5.10.0 (product release 23.2), where
  the maximum number of nested elements were programmatically limited. A workaround is available.
  After deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and
  path_idx), the database becomes stable and ReportPortal works properly.
