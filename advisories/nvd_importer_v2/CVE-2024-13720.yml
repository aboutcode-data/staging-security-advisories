aliases: []
summary: The WP Image Uploader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion
  due to insufficient file path validation in the gky_image_uploader_main_function() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when
  the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
