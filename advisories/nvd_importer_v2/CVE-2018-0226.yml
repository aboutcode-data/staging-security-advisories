aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the assignment and management of default user accounts for Secure
  Shell (SSH) access to Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points that are running
  Cisco Mobility Express Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain elevated
  privileges on an affected access point. The vulnerability exists because the Cisco Mobility
  Express controller of the affected software configures the default SSH user account for an
  access point to be the first SSH user account that was created for the Mobility Express controller,
  if an administrator added user accounts directly to the controller instead of using the default
  configuration or the SSH username creation wizard. Although the user account has read-only
  privileges for the Mobility Express controller, the account could have administrative privileges
  for an associated access point. An attacker who has valid user credentials for an affected
  controller could exploit this vulnerability by using the default SSH user account to authenticate
  to an affected access point via SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log
  in to the affected access point with administrative privileges and perform arbitrary administrative
  actions. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products: Aironet 1800 Series Access
  Points that are running Cisco Mobility Express Software Releases 8.2.121.0 through 8.5.105.0,
  Aironet 2800 Series Access Points that are running Cisco Mobility Express Software Releases
  8.3.102.0 through 8.5.105.0, Aironet 3800 Series Access Points that are running Cisco Mobility
  Express Software Releases 8.3.102.0 through 8.5.105.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva68116.'
