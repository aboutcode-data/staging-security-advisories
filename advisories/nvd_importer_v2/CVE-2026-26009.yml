summary: Catalyst is a platform built for enterprise game server hosts, game communities, and
  billing panel integrations. Install scripts defined in server templates execute directly on
  the host operating system as root via bash -c, with no sandboxing or containerization. Any
  user with template.create or template.update permission can define arbitrary shell commands
  that achieve full root-level remote code execution on every node machine in the cluster. This
  vulnerability is fixed in commit 11980aaf3f46315b02777f325ba02c56b110165d.
