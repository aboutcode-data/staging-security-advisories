summary: 'Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology product of Oracle Fusion Middleware
  (component: Outside In Filters). The supported version that is affected is 8.5.4. Easily exploitable
  vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle
  Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
  update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Outside In Technology accessible data and
  unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Outside
  In Technology. Note: Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs).
  The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code.
  The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside
  In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.
  CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.5 (Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L).'
