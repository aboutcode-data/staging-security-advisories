summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390/vfio-ap: fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver

  The device release callback function invoked to release the matrix device
  uses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the
  pointer to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The
  problem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the
  kfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the
  vfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.

  Since the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev
  object, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.
