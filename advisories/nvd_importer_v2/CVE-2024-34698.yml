summary: FreeScout is a free, self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout
  prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source
  file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges
  an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters
  Parsing), without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property
  with a key `__proto__`, along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns
  the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself.
  As a result, the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values,
  which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application
  dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise
  be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in
  an unsafe way, this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS,
  Open Redirection, Cookie Manipulation, Link Manipulation, HTML Injection, etc. Version 1.8.139
  contains a patch for the issue.
