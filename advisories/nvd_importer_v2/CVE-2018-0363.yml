summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager IM & Presence Service (formerly CUPS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an
  affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based
  management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with
  the privileges of the user. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi55878.'
