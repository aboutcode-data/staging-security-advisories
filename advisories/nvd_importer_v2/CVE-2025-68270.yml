summary: The Open edX Platform is a learning management platform. Prior to commit 05d0d0936daf82c476617257aa6c35f0cd4ca060,
  CourseLimitedStaffRole users are able to access and edit courses in studio if they are granted
  the role on an org rather than on a course, and CourseLimitedStaffRole users are able to list
  courses they have the role on in studio even though they are not meant to have any access
  on the studio side for the course. Commit 05d0d0936daf82c476617257aa6c35f0cd4ca060 fixes the
  issue.
