aliases: []
summary: Brave is an open source web browser with a focus on privacy and security. In Brave
  versions 1.17.73-1.20.103, the CNAME adblocking feature added in Brave 1.17.73 accidentally
  initiated DNS requests that bypassed the Brave Tor proxy. Users with adblocking enabled would
  leak DNS requests from Tor windows to their DNS provider. (DNS requests that were not initiated
  by CNAME adblocking would go through Tor as expected.) This is fixed in Brave version 1.20.108
