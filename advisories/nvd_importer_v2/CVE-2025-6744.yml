aliases: []
summary: The The Woodmart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution
  in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.3. This is due to the software allowing users to
  execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode through
  the woodmart_get_products_shortcode() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
