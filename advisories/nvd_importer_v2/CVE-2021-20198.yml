summary: A flaw was found in the OpenShift Installer before version v0.9.0-master.0.20210125200451-95101da940b0.
  During installation of OpenShift Container Platform 4 clusters, bootstrap nodes are provisioned
  with anonymous authentication enabled on kubelet port 10250. A remote attacker able to reach
  this port during installation can make unauthenticated `/exec` requests to execute arbitrary
  commands within running containers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
  confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
