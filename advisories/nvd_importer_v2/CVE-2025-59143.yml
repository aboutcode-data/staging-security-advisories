aliases: []
summary: color is a Javascript color conversion and manipulation library. On 8 September 2025,
  the npm publishing account for color was taken over after a phishing attack. Version 5.0.1
  was published, functionally identical to the previous patch version, but with a malware payload
  added attempting to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to the attacker's own addresses from
  within browser environments. Local environments, server environments, command line applications,
  etc. are not affected. If the package was used in a browser context (e.g. a direct <script>
  inclusion, or via a bundling tool such as Babel, Rollup, Vite, Next.js, etc.) there is a chance
  the malware still exists and such bundles will need to be rebuilt. The malware seemingly only
  targets cryptocurrency transactions and wallets such as MetaMask. npm removed the offending
  package from the registry over the course of the day on 8 September, preventing further downloads
  from npm proper. On 13 September, the package owner published new patch versions to help cache-bust
  those using private registries who might still have the compromised version cached. Users
  should update to the latest patch version, completely remove their node_modules directory,
  clean their package manager's global cache, and rebuild any browser bundles from scratch.
  Those operating private registries or registry mirrors should purge the offending versions
  from any caches. This issues has been resolved in 5.0.2.
