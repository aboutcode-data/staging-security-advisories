aliases: []
summary: 'WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain dangerous situations,
  which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct delayed and persistent cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) attacks via crafted cookies, as demonstrated by attacks that (1) delete user
  accounts or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of application access).  NOTE: this issue
  relies on the presence of an independent vulnerability that allows cookie injection.'
