aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms application, specifically
  within the `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` and `sanitize_path` functions in `lollms_core\lollms\security.py`.
  This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading when the application is running on Windows.
  The issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, enabling attackers
  to bypass the path traversal protection mechanisms by crafting malicious input. Successful
  exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure,
  and potentially a denial of service (DoS) condition by including numerous large or resource-intensive
  files. This vulnerability affects the latest version prior to 9.6.
