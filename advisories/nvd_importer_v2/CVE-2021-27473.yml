summary: Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior does not sanitize
  paths specified within the .ccwarc archive file during extraction. This type of vulnerability
  is also commonly referred to as a Zip Slip. A local, authenticated attacker can create a malicious
  .ccwarc archive file that, when opened by Connected Components Workbench, will allow the attacker
  to gain the privileges of the software. If the software is running at SYSTEM level, the attacker
  will gain admin level privileges. User interaction is required for this exploit to be successful.
