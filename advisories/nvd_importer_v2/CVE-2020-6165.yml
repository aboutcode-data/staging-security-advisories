aliases: []
summary: SilverStripe 4.5.0 allows attackers to read certain records that should not have been
  placed into a result set. This affects silverstripe/recipe-cms. The automatic permission-checking
  mechanism in the silverstripe/graphql module does not provide complete protection against
  lists that are limited (e.g., through pagination), resulting in records that should have failed
  a permission check being added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by
  default (e.g., for assets), but the admin/graphql endpoint is access protected by default.
  This limits the vulnerability to all authenticated users, including those with limited permissions
  (e.g., where viewing records exposed through admin/graphql requires administrator permissions).
  However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured for a specific implementation (usually
  under /graphql), this vulnerability could also be exploited through unauthenticated requests.
  This vulnerability only applies to reading records; it does not allow unauthorised changing
  of records.
