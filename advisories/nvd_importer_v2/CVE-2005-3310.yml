aliases: []
summary: 'Interpretation conflict in phpBB 2.0.17, with remote avatars and avatar uploading
  enabled, allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an HTML
  file with a GIF or JPEG file extension, which causes the HTML to be executed by a victim who
  views the file in Internet Explorer, which renders malformed image types as HTML, enabling
  cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due
  to a design flaw in Internet Explorer (CVE-2005-3312) and the proper fix should be in that
  browser; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpBB.'
