aliases: []
summary: Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication
  system for Flask. In versions prior to 3.3.11, the API endpoint used to manage event series
  is missing an access check, allowing unauthenticated/unauthorized access to this endpoint.
  The impact of this is limited to getting the metadata (title, category chain, start/end date)
  for events in an existing series, deleting an existing event series, and modifying an existing
  event series. This vulnerability does NOT allow unauthorized access to events (beyond the
  basic metadata mentioned above), nor any kind of tampering with user-visible data in events.
  Version 3.3.11 fixes the issue. As a workaround, use the webserver to restrict access to the
  series management API endpoint.
