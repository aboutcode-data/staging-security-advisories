summary: 'Reolink Video Doorbell WiFi DB_566128M5MP_W allows root shell access through an unsecured
  UART/serial console. An attacker with physical access can connect to the exposed interface
  and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier
  because of "certain restrictions on users privately connecting serial port cables" and because
  "the root user has a password and it meets the requirements of password security complexity."'
