summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: vxlan: prevent NULL deref in vxlan_xmit_one

  Neither sock4 nor sock6 pointers are guaranteed to be non-NULL in
  vxlan_xmit_one, e.g. if the iface is brought down. This can lead to the
  following NULL dereference:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010
    Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI
    RIP: 0010:vxlan_xmit_one+0xbb3/0x1580
    Call Trace:
     vxlan_xmit+0x429/0x610
     dev_hard_start_xmit+0x55/0xa0
     __dev_queue_xmit+0x6d0/0x7f0
     ip_finish_output2+0x24b/0x590
     ip_output+0x63/0x110

  Mentioned commits changed the code path in vxlan_xmit_one and as a side
  effect the sock4/6 pointer validity checks in vxlan(6)_get_route were
  lost. Fix this by adding back checks.

  Since both commits being fixed were released in the same version (v6.7)
  and are strongly related, bundle the fixes in a single commit.
