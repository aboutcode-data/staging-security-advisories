aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Decryption
  and Verification or S/MIME Public Key Harvesting features of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco
  Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an
  affected device to corrupt system memory. A successful exploit could cause the filtering process
  to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. The
  vulnerability is due to improper input validation of S/MIME-signed emails. An attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious S/MIME-signed email through a targeted device.
  If Decryption and Verification or Public Key Harvesting is configured, the filtering process
  could crash due to memory corruption and restart, resulting in a DoS condition. The software
  could then resume processing the same S/MIME-signed email, causing the filtering process to
  crash and restart again. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent
  DoS condition. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to recover the ESA.
