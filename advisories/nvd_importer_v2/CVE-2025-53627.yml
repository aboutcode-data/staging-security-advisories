aliases: []
summary: Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. The Meshtastic firmware (starting
  from version 2.5) introduces asymmetric encryption (PKI) for direct messages, but when the
  `pki_encrypted` flag is missing, the firmware silently falls back to legacy AES-256-CTR channel
  encryption. This was an intentional decision to maintain backwards compatibility. However,
  the end-user applications, like Web app, iOS/Android app, and applications built on top of
  Meshtastic using the SDK, did not have a way to differentiate between end-to-end encrypted
  DMs and the legacy DMs. This creates a downgrade attack path where adversaries who know a
  shared channel key can craft and inject spoofed direct messages that are displayed as if they
  were PKC encrypted. Users are not given any feedback of whether a direct message was decrypted
  with PKI or with legacy symmetric encryption, undermining the expected security guarantees
  of the PKI rollout. Version 2.7.15 fixes this issue.
