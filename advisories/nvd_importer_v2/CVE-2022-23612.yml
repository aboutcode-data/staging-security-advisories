aliases: []
summary: 'OpenMRS is a patient-based medical record system focusing on giving providers a free
  customizable electronic medical record system. Affected versions are subject to arbitrary
  file exfiltration due to failure to sanitize request when satisfying GET requests for `/images`
  & `/initfilter/scripts`. This can allow an attacker to access any file on a system running
  OpenMRS that is accessible to the user id OpenMRS is running under. Affected implementations
  should update to the latest patch version of OpenMRS Core for the minor version they use.
  These are: 2.1.5, 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 2.4.5 and 2.5.3. As a general rule, this vulnerability is
  already mitigated by Tomcat''s URL normalization in Tomcat 7.0.28+. Users on older versions
  of Tomcat should consider upgrading their Tomcat instance as well as their OpenMRS instance.'
