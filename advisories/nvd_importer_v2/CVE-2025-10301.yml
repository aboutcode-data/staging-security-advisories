summary: The FunKItools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the saveFields() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
  plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
