aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in DriveLock 24.1 through 24.1.*, 24.2 through 24.2.*, and
  25.1 before 25.1.6. Users with the "Manage roles and permissions" privilege can promote themselves
  or other DOC users to the Supervisor role through an API call. This privilege is included
  by default in the Administrator role. This issue mainly affects cloud multi-tenant deployments;
  on-prem single-tenant installations are typically not impacted because local admins usually
  already have Supervisor privileges.
