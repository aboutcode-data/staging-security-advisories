aliases: []
summary: Aruba ClearPass 6.6.3 and later includes a feature called "SSH Lockout", which causes
  ClearPass to lock accounts with too many login failures through SSH. When this feature is
  enabled, an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability is present which could
  allow an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system
  with "root" privilege level. This vulnerability is only present when a specific feature has
  been enabled. The SSH Lockout feature is not enabled by default, so only systems which have
  enabled this feature are vulnerable.
