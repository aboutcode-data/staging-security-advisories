aliases: []
summary: Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD
  protocol suite. In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores
  the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS.
  Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()`
  always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit.
  When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs
  unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory
  and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting
  local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request.
  Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local
  addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate
  fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are
  offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket
  `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly.
  Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they
  use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon
  is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access
  restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution
  working for trusted users.
