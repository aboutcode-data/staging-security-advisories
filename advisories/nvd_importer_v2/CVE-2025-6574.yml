aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via account takeover in all versions up to, and excluding, 6.1. This is due to the plugin
  not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to
  change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset
  the user's password and gain access to their account.
