aliases: []
summary: Mesop is a Python-based UI framework that allows users to build web applications. A
  class pollution vulnerability in Mesop prior to version 0.14.1 allows attackers to overwrite
  global variables and class attributes in certain Mesop modules during runtime. This vulnerability
  could directly lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack against the server. Additionally,
  it could also result in other severe consequences given the application's implementation,
  such as identity confusion, where an attacker could impersonate an assistant or system role
  within conversations. This impersonation could potentially enable jailbreak attacks when interacting
  with large language models (LLMs). Just like the Javascript's prototype pollution, this vulnerability
  could leave a way for attackers to manipulate the intended data-flow or control-flow of the
  application at runtime and lead to severe consequences like remote code execution when gadgets
  are available. Users should upgrade to version 0.14.1 to obtain a fix for the issue.
