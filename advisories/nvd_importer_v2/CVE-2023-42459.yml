aliases: []
summary: Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of
  the OMG (Object Management Group). In affected versions specific DATA submessages can be sent
  to a discovery locator which may trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS
  process. The call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control which
  could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3,
  and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
