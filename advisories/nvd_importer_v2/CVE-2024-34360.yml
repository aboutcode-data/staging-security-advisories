aliases: []
summary: go-spacemesh is a Go implementation of the Spacemesh protocol full node. Nodes can
  publish activations transactions (ATXs) which reference the incorrect previous ATX of the
  Smesher that created the ATX. ATXs are expected to form a single chain from the newest to
  the first ATX ever published by an identity. Allowing Smeshers to reference an earlier (but
  not the latest) ATX as previous breaks this protocol rule and can serve as an attack vector
  where Nodes are rewarded for holding their PoST data for less than one epoch but still being
  eligible for rewards. This vulnerability is fixed in go-spacemesh 1.5.2-hotfix1 and Spacemesh
  API 1.37.1.
