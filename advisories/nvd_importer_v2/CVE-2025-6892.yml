aliases: []
summary: An Incorrect Authorization vulnerability has been identified in Moxa’s network security
  appliances and routers. A flaw in the API authentication mechanism allows unauthorized access
  to protected API endpoints, including those intended for administrative functions. This vulnerability
  can be exploited after a legitimate user has logged in, as the system fails to properly validate
  session context or privilege boundaries. An attacker may leverage this flaw to perform unauthorized
  privileged operations. While successful exploitation can severely impact the confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability of the affected device itself, there is no loss of confidentiality
  or integrity within any subsequent systems.
