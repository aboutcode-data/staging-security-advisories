summary: Discourse Assign is a plugin for assigning users to a topic in Discourse, an open-source
  messaging platform. Prior to version 1.0.1, the UserBookmarkSerializer serialized the whole
  User / Group object, which leaked some private information. The data was only being serialized
  to people who could view assignment info, which is limited to staff by default. For the vast
  majority of sites, this data was only leaked to trusted staff member, but for sites with assign
  features enabled publicly, the data was accessible to more people than just staff. Version
  1.0.1 contains a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.
