aliases: []
summary: The User Registration – Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress
  Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Display
  Name' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization
  and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability
  requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited
  due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.
