aliases: []
summary: Zincati is an auto-update agent for Fedora CoreOS hosts. Zincati ships a polkit rule
  which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy`
  to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to
  reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains
  a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather
  than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with
  access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may
  have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version
  must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to
  deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted
  workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads
  should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not
  have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. A workaround
  is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the GitHub
  Security Advisory.
