  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  fs: quota: create dedicated workqueue for quota_release_work

  There is a kernel panic due to WARN_ONCE when panic_on_warn is set.

  This issue occurs when writeback is triggered due to sync call for an
  opened file(ie, writeback reason is WB_REASON_SYNC). When f2fs balance
  is needed at sync path, flush for quota_release_work is triggered.
  By default quota_release_work is queued to "events_unbound" queue which
  does not have WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag. During f2fs balance "writeback"
  workqueue tries to flush quota_release_work causing kernel panic due to
  MEM_RECLAIM flag mismatch errors.

  This patch creates dedicated workqueue with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag
  for work quota_release_work.
