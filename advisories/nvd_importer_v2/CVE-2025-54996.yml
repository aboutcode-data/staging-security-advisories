aliases: []
summary: OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive
  data including secrets, certificates, and keys. In versions 2.3.1 and below, accounts with
  access to highly-privileged identity entity systems in root namespaces were able to increase
  their scope directly to the root policy. While the identity system allowed adding arbitrary
  policies, which in turn could contain capability grants on arbitrary paths, the root policy
  was restricted to manual generation using unseal or recovery key shares. The global root policy
  was not accessible from child namespaces. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.2. To workaround
  this vulnerability, use of denied_parameters in any policy which has access to the affected
  identity endpoints (on identity entities) may be sufficient to prohibit this type of attack.
