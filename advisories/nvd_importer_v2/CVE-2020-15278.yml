aliases: []
summary: Red Discord Bot before version 3.4.1 has an unauthorized privilege escalation exploit
  in the Mod module. This exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege level within the
  guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond
  that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it is possible to perform destructive actions
  within the guild the user has high privileges in. This exploit has been fixed in version 3.4.1.
  As a workaround, unloading the Mod module with unload mod or, disabling the massban command
  with command disable global massban can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly
  recommend updating to 3.4.1 to completely patch this issue.
