summary: ZITADEL is an open source identity management platform. Zitadel Action V2 (introduced
  as early preview in 2.59.0, beta in 3.0.0 and GA in 4.0.0) is a webhook based approach to
  allow developers act on API request to Zitadel and customize flows such the issue of a token.
  Zitadel's Action target URLs can point to local hosts, potentially allowing adversaries to
  gather internal network information and connect to internal services. When the URL points
  to a local host / IP address, an adversary might gather information about the internal network
  structure, the services exposed on internal hosts etc. This is sometimes called a Server-Side
  Request Forgery (SSRF). Zitadel Actions expect responses according to specific schemas, which
  reduces the threat vector. The patch in version 4.11.1 resolves the issue by checking the
  target URL against a denylist. By default localhost, resp. loopback IPs are denied. Note that
  this fix was only released on v4.x. Due to the stage (preview / beta) in which the functionality
  was in v2.x and v3.x, the changes that have been applied to it since then and the severity,
  respectively the actual thread vector, a backport to the corresponding versions was not feasible.
  Please check the workaround section for alternative solutions if an upgrade to v4.x is not
  possible. If an upgrade is not possible, prevent actions from using unintended endpoints by
  setting network policies or firewall rules in one's own infrastructure. Note that this is
  outside of the functionality provided by Zitadel.
