aliases: []
summary: Sonos api.sonos.com through 2025-04-21, when the /login/v3/oauth endpoint is used,
  accepts a redirect_uri containing userinfo in the authority component, which is not consistent
  with RFC 6819 section 5.2.3.5. An authorization code may be sent to an attacker-controlled
  destination. This might have further implications in conjunction with "Decompiling the app
  revealed a hardcoded secret."
