aliases: []
summary: "quiche v. 0.15.0 through 0.19.0 was discovered to be vulnerable to unbounded queuing\
  \ of path validation messages, which could lead to excessive resource consumption.\nQUIC path\
  \ validation (RFC 9000 Section 8.2) requires that the recipient of a PATH_CHALLENGE frame\
  \ responds by sending a PATH_RESPONSE. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the\
  \ vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by\
  \ restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be\
  \ sent at the slower rate than they are received; leading to storage of path validation data\
  \ in an unbounded queue. \nQuiche versions greater than 0.19.0 address this problem."
