  fs: Fix uninitialized 'offp' in statmount_string()

  In statmount_string(), most flags assign an output offset pointer (offp)
  which is later updated with the string offset. However, the
  STATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the
  struct fields instead of using offp. This leaves offp uninitialized,
  leading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.

  Fix it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code
  path consistent.
