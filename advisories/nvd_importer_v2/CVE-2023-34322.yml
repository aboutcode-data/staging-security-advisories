aliases: []
summary: |
  For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see
  XSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode.  Since Xen itself
  needs to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run
  directly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests this
  means running on the shadow of the guest root page table.

  In the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool
  associated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.  This
  tearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in
  question is presently running on.  While a precaution exists to
  supposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table,
  the time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.
