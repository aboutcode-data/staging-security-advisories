aliases: []
summary: semantic-release is an open source npm package for automated version management and
  package publishing. In affected versions secrets that would normally be masked by semantic-release
  can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that are excluded from uri encoding
  by `encodeURI`. Occurrence is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the
  related repository is not available without modifying the repository url to inject credentials.
  Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that secrets that do not
  contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL
  are already masked properly.
