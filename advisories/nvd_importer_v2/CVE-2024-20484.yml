summary: "A vulnerability in the External Agent Assignment Service (EAAS) feature of Cisco Enterprise\
  \ Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of\
  \ service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient\
  \ validation of Media Routing Peripheral Interface Manager (MR PIM) traffic that is received\
  \ by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MR\
  \ PIM traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger\
  \ a failure on the MR PIM connection between Cisco ECE and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise\
  \ (CCE), leading to a DoS condition on EAAS that would prevent customers from starting chat,\
  \ callback, or delayed callback sessions. Note: When the attack traffic stops, the EAAS process\
  \ must be manually restarted to restore normal operation. To restart the process in the System\
  \ Console, choose Shared Resources &gt; Services &gt; Unified CCE &gt; EAAS, then click Start."
