aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Contacts
  application prior to version 4.0.3 was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
  For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in
  a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not
  exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that
  the Nextcloud Contacts application is upgraded to 4.0.3. As a workaround, one may use a browser
  that has support for Content-Security-Policy.
