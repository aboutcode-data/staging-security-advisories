summary: The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin – Super Socializer plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including,
  7.13.68. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social
  login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing
  user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing
  account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator
  by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly
  been allowed via the social login. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 7.13.68.
