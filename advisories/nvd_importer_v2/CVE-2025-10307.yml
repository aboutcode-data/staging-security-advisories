aliases: []
summary: The Backuply – Backup, Restore, Migrate and Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete backup functionality
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which
  can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
