aliases: []
summary: FUXA 1.2.8 and prior contains an Authentication Bypass vulnerability leading to Remote
  Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerability exists in the server/api/jwt-helper.js middleware,
  which improperly trusts the HTTP "Referer" header to validate internal requests. A remote
  unauthenticated attacker can bypass JWT authentication by spoofing the Referer header to match
  the server's host. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to access the protected /api/runscript
  endpoint and execute arbitrary Node.js code on the server.
