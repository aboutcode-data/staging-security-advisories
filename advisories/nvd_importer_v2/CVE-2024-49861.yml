  bpf: Fix helper writes to read-only maps

  Lonial found an issue that despite user- and BPF-side frozen BPF map
  (like in case of .rodata), it was still possible to write into it from
  a BPF program side through specific helpers having ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}
  as arguments.

  In check_func_arg() when the argument is as mentioned, the meta->raw_mode
  is never set. Later, check_helper_mem_access(), under the case of
  PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE as register base type, it assumes BPF_READ for the
  subsequent call to check_map_access_type() and given the BPF map is
  read-only it succeeds.

  The helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT
  when results are written into them as opposed to read out of them. The
  latter indicates that it's okay to pass a pointer to uninitialized memory
  as the memory is written to anyway.

  However, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM
  just with additional alignment requirement. So it is better to just get
  rid of the ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} special cases altogether and reuse the
  fixed size memory types. For this, add MEM_ALIGNED to additionally ensure
  alignment given these helpers write directly into the args via *<ptr> = val.
  The .arg*_size has been initialized reflecting the actual sizeof(*<ptr>).

  MEM_ALIGNED can only be used in combination with MEM_FIXED_SIZE annotated
  argument types, since in !MEM_FIXED_SIZE cases the verifier does not know
  the buffer size a priori and therefore cannot blindly write *<ptr> = val.
