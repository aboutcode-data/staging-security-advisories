aliases: []
summary: 'An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint
  of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service
  (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the
  server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a ''Content-Length: 0'' header
  or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as ''asdasdasd'', with a ''Content-Length:
  9'' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a ''Manager'' role, sending
  a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective
  in mitigating the vulnerability.'
