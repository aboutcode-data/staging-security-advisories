aliases: []
summary: '@sap-cloud-sdk/core contains the core functionality of the SAP Cloud SDK as well as
  the SAP Business Technology Platform abstractions. This affects applications on SAP Business
  Technology Platform that use the SAP Cloud SDK and enabled caching of destinations. In affected
  versions and in some cases, when user information was missing, destinations were cached without
  user information, allowing other users to retrieve the same destination with its permissions.
  By default, destination caching is disabled. The security for caching has been increased.
  The changes are released in version 1.52.0. Users unable to upgrade are advised to disable
  destination caching (it is disabled by default).'
