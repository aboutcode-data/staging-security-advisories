summary: VRCX is an assistant/companion application for VRChat. In versions prior to 2024.03.23,
  a CefSharp browser with over-permission and cross-site scripting via overlay notification
  can be combined to result in remote command execution. These vulnerabilities are patched in
  VRCX 2023.12.24. In addition to the patch, VRCX maintainers worked with the VRC team and blocked
  the older version of VRCX on the VRC's API side. Users who use the older version of VRCX must
  update their installation to continue using VRCX.
