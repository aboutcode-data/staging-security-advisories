summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: visconti: prevent array overflow in visconti_clk_register_gates()

  This code was using -1 to represent that there was no reset function.
  Unfortunately, the -1 was stored in u8 so the if (clks[i].rs_id >= 0)
  condition was always true.  This lead to an out of bounds access in
  visconti_clk_register_gates().
