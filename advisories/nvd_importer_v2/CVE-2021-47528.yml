  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  usb: cdnsp: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in cdnsp_endpoint_init()

  In cdnsp_endpoint_init(), cdnsp_ring_alloc() is assigned to pep->ring
  and there is a dereference of it in cdnsp_endpoint_init(), which could
  lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of cdnsp_ring_alloc().

  Fix this bug by adding a check of pep->ring.

  This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
  differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
  (e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
  inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
  the callers, so they constitute bugs.

  Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
  positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
  the bug.

  Builds with CONFIG_USB_CDNSP_GADGET=y show no new warnings,
  and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.
