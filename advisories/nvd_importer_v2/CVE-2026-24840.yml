aliases: []
summary: Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). In versions prior to
  0.26.6, a hardcoded credential in the provided installation script (located at https://dokploy.com/install.sh,
  line 154) uses a hardcoded password when creating the database container. This means that
  nearly all Dokploy installations use the same database credentials and could be compromised.
  Version 0.26.6 contains a patch for the issue.
