aliases: []
summary: An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when the signature
  was created. When displaying an email that contains a digital signature, the email's date
  will be shown. If the dates were different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having
  an invalid signature. If an attacker performed a replay attack, in which an old email with
  old contents are resent at a later time, it could lead the victim to believe that the statements
  in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require that the signature's
  date roughly matches the displayed date of the email. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
  < 102 and Thunderbird < 91.11.
