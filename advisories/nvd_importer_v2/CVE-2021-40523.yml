aliases: []
summary: In Contiki 3.0, Telnet option negotiation is mishandled. During negotiation between
  a server and a client, the server may fail to give the WILL/WONT or DO/DONT response for DO
  and WILL commands because of improper handling of exception condition, which leads to property
  violations and denial of service. Specifically, a server sometimes sends no response, because
  a fixed buffer space is available for all responses and that space may have been exhausted.
