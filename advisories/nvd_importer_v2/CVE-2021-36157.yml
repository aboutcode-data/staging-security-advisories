aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Grafana Cortex through 1.9.0. The header value X-Scope-OrgID
  is used to construct file paths for rules files, and if crafted to conduct directory traversal
  such as ae ../../sensitive/path/in/deployment pathname, then Cortex will attempt to parse
  a rules file at that location and include some of the contents in the error message. (Other
  Cortex API requests can also be sent a malicious OrgID header, e.g., tricking the ingester
  into writing metrics to a different location, but the effect is nuisance rather than information
  disclosure.)
