aliases: []
summary: The Samba AD DC includes checks when adding service principals names (SPNs) to an account
  to ensure that SPNs do not alias with those already in the database. Some of these checks
  are able to be bypassed if an account modification re-adds an SPN that was previously present
  on that account, such as one added when a computer is joined to a domain. An attacker who
  has the ability to write to an account can exploit this to perform a denial-of-service attack
  by adding an SPN that matches an existing service. Additionally, an attacker who can intercept
  traffic can impersonate existing services, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity.
