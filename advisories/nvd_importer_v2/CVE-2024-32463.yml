aliases: []
summary: phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. There
  is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously
  crafted user data. The filter to detect and prevent the use of the `javascript:` URL scheme
  in the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag could be bypassed with tab `\t` or newline `\n` characters
  between the characters of the protocol, e.g. `java\tscript:`. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 1.10.1, 1.9.2, 1.8.3, 1.7.2, 1.6.3, 1.5.3, and 1.4.2. Configuring a Content Security Policy
  that does not allow `unsafe-inline` would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being
  exploited.
