aliases: []
summary: Due to the Asset Explorer agent not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the
  network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP
  address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the
  network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp,
  the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response
  is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written
  to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.
