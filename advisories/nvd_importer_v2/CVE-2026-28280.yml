aliases: []
summary: osctrl is an osquery management solution. Prior to version 0.5.0, a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `osctrl-admin` on-demand query list. A user with
  query-level permissions can inject arbitrary JavaScript via the query parameter when running
  an on-demand query. The payload is stored and executes in the browser of any user (including
  administrators) who visits the query list page. This can be chained with CSRF token extraction
  to escalate privileges and take actions as the logged in user. An attacker with query-level
  permissions (the lowest privilege tier) can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of
  all users who view the query list. Depending on their level of access, it can lead to full
  platform compromise if an administrator executes the payload. The issue is fixed in osctrl
  `v0.5.0`. As a workaround, restrict query-level permissions to trusted users, monitor query
  list for suspicious payloads, and/or review osctrl user accounts for unauthorized administrators.
