aliases: []
summary: The FunnelKit Automations – Email Marketing Automation and CRM for WordPress & WooCommerce
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including,
  3.6.4.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform
  administrative actions in the `bwfan_test_email` AJAX handler. The nonce used for verification
  is publicly exposed to all visitors (including unauthenticated users) via the frontend JavaScript
  localization, and the `check_nonce()` function accepts low-privilege authenticated users who
  possess this nonce. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to send arbitrary emails from the site with attacker-controlled subject
  and body content.
