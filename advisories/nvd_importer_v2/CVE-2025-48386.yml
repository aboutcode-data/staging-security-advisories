aliases: []
summary: Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich
  command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. The wincred
  credential helper uses a static buffer (target) as a unique key for storing and comparing
  against internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds check the available
  space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with wcsncat(), leading to potential
  buffer overflows. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3,
  v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.
