aliases: []
summary: 'An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the GlobalProtect SSL VPN component
  of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that allows an attacker to bypass all client certificate
  checks with an invalid certificate. A remote attacker can successfully authenticate as any
  user and gain access to restricted VPN network resources when the gateway or portal is configured
  to rely entirely on certificate-based authentication. Impacted features that use SSL VPN with
  client certificate verification are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect
  Clientless VPN In configurations where client certificate verification is used in conjunction
  with other authentication methods, the protections added by the certificate check are ignored
  as a result of this issue. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.17;
  PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.11; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5;
  PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.1.'
