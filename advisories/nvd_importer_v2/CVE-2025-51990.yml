aliases: []
summary: XWiki through version 17.3.0 is affected by multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  vulnerabilities in the Administration interface, specifically under the Presentation section
  of the Global Preferences panel. An authenticated administrator can inject arbitrary JavaScript
  payloads into the HTTP Meta Info, Footer Copyright, and Footer Version fields. These inputs
  are stored and subsequently rendered without proper output encoding or sanitization on public-facing
  pages. As a result, the injected scripts are persistently executed in the browser context
  of any visitor to the affected instances including both authenticated and unauthenticated
  users. No user interaction is required beyond visiting a page that includes the malicious
  content. Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, unauthorized
  actions via session riding, or further compromise of the application through client-side attacks.
  The vulnerability introduces significant risk in any deployment, especially in shared or internet-facing
  environments where administrator credentials may be compromised.
