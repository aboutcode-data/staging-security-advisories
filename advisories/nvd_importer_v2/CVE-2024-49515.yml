summary: Substance3D - Painter versions 10.1.0 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search
  Path vulnerability that might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. If the application
  uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify
  that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then
  execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts.
  Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious
  file.
