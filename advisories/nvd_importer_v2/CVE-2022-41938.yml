aliases: []
summary: Flarum is an open source discussion platform. Flarum's page title system allowed for
  page titles to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when pages were rendered. The change was made
  after `v1.5` and was not noticed. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML markup
  using a discussion title input, either by creating a new discussion or renaming one. The XSS
  attack occurs after a visitor opens the relevant discussion page. All communities running
  Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` are impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed and published
  as flarum/core `v1.6.2`. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` have to
  upgrade as soon as possible to v1.6.2. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
