summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. Prior to version 2.44.0, a timing-based
  username enumeration vulnerability exists in Fides Webserver authentication. This vulnerability
  allows an unauthenticated attacker to determine the existence of valid usernames by analyzing
  the time it takes for the server to respond to login requests. The discrepancy in response
  times between valid and invalid usernames can be leveraged to enumerate users on the system.
  This vulnerability enables a timing-based username enumeration attack. An attacker can systematically
  guess and verify which usernames are valid by measuring the server's response time to authentication
  requests. This information can be used to conduct further attacks on authentication such as
  password brute-forcing and credential stuffing. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides
  version `2.44.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems
  against this threat. There are no workarounds.
