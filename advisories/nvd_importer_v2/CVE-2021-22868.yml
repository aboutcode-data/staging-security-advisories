aliases: []
summary: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could
  be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options used
  by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the
  GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission
  to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability
  affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.1.8 and was fixed in 3.1.8, 3.0.16,
  and 2.22.22. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program. This is the
  result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-22867.
