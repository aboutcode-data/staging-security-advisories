summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: mdio: Check regmap pointer returned by device_node_to_regmap()

  The call to device_node_to_regmap() in airoha_mdio_probe() can return
  an ERR_PTR() if regmap initialization fails. Currently, the driver
  stores the pointer without validation, which could lead to a crash
  if it is later dereferenced.

  Add an IS_ERR() check and return the corresponding error code to make
  the probe path more robust.
