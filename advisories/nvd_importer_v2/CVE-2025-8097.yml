aliases: []
summary: The WoodMart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Input Validation in all
  versions up to, and including, 8.2.6. This is due to insufficient validation of the qty parameter
  in the woodmart_update_cart_item function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to manipulate cart quantities using fractional values, allowing them to obtain products for
  free by setting extremely small quantities (e.g., 0.00001) that round cart totals to $0.00,
  effectively bypassing payment requirements and allowing unauthorized acquisition of virtual
  or downloadable products.
