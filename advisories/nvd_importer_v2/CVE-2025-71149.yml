summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring/poll: correctly handle io_poll_add() return value on update

  When the core of io_uring was updated to handle completions
  consistently and with fixed return codes, the POLL_REMOVE opcode
  with updates got slightly broken. If a POLL_ADD is pending and
  then POLL_REMOVE is used to update the events of that request, if that
  update causes the POLL_ADD to now trigger, then that completion is lost
  and a CQE is never posted.

  Additionally, ensure that if an update does cause an existing POLL_ADD
  to complete, that the completion value isn't always overwritten with
  -ECANCELED. For that case, whatever io_poll_add() set the value to
  should just be retained.
