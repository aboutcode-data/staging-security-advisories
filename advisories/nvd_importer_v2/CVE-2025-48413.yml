summary: The `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files reveal hard-coded password hashes for the
  operating system "root" user. The credentials are shipped with the update files. There is
  no option for deleting or changing their passwords for an enduser. An attacker can use the
  credentials to log into the device. Authentication can be performed via SSH backdoor or likely
  via physical access (UART shell).
