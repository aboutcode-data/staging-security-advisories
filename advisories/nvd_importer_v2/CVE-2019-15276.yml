aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software could
  allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
  condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists due to a failure of the HTTP parsing
  engine to handle specially crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
  with low privileges to an affected controller and submitting the crafted URL to the web interface
  of the affected device. Conversely, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by persuading a user of the web interface to click the crafted URL. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the device, resulting in a DoS condition.
