aliases: []
summary: The MyParcel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due
  to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to,
  and including, 4.24.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary
  web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
  action such as clicking on a link. Please note this is only exploitable when the WooCommerce
  store is set to Belgium.
