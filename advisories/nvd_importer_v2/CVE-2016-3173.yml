aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX AppSuite before 7.8.0-rev27. The aria-label
  parameter of tiles at the Portal can be used to inject script code. Those labels use the name
  of the file (e.g. an image) which gets displayed at the portal application. Using script code
  at the file name leads to script execution. Malicious script code can be executed within a
  user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the
  web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). Users actively need to add a file to the
  portal to enable this attack. In case of shared files however, a internal attacker may modify
  a previously embedded file to carry a malicious file name. Furthermore this vulnerability
  can be used to persistently execute code that got injected by a temporary script execution
  vulnerability.
