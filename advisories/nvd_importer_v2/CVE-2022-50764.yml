aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ipv6/sit: use DEV_STATS_INC() to avoid data-races

  syzbot/KCSAN reported that multiple cpus are updating dev->stats.tx_error
  concurrently.

  This is because sit tunnels are NETIF_F_LLTX, meaning their ndo_start_xmit()
  is not protected by a spinlock.

  While original KCSAN report was about tx path, rx path has the same issue.
