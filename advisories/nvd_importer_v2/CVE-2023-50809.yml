summary: In certain Sonos products before S1 Release 11.12 and S2 release 15.9, the mt_7615.ko
  wireless driver does not properly validate an information element during negotiation of a
  WPA2 four-way handshake. This lack of validation leads to a stack buffer overflow. This can
  result in remote code execution within the kernel. This affects Amp, Arc, Arc SL, Beam, Beam
  Gen 2, Beam SL, and Five.
