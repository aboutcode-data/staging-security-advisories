summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  virt/coco/sev-guest: Double-buffer messages

  memory, which may leak information as well as permit the host to tamper
  with the message integrity. Instead, copy whole messages in or out as
  needed before doing any computation on them.
