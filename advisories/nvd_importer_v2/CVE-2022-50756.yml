  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nvme-pci: fix mempool alloc size

  Convert the max size to bytes to match the units of the divisor that
  calculates the worst-case number of PRP entries.

  The result is used to determine how many PRP Lists are required. The
  code was previously rounding this to 1 list, but we can require 2 in the
  worst case. In that scenario, the driver would corrupt memory beyond the
  size provided by the mempool.

  While unlikely to occur (you'd need a 4MB in exactly 127 phys segments
  on a queue that doesn't support SGLs), this memory corruption has been
  observed by kfence.
