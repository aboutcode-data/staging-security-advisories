  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  KVM: x86: Drop WARNs that assert a triple fault never "escapes" from L2

  Remove WARNs that sanity check that KVM never lets a triple fault for L2
  escape and incorrectly end up in L1.  In normal operation, the sanity
  check is perfectly valid, but it incorrectly assumes that it's impossible
  for userspace to induce KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT without bouncing through
  KVM_RUN (which guarantees kvm_check_nested_state() will see and handle
  the triple fault).

  The WARN can currently be triggered if userspace injects a machine check
  while L2 is active and CR4.MCE=0.  And a future fix to allow save/restore
  of KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT, e.g. so that a synthesized triple fault isn't
  lost on migration, will make it trivially easy for userspace to trigger
  the WARN.

  Clearing KVM_REQ_TRIPLE_FAULT when forcibly leaving guest mode is
  tempting, but wrong, especially if/when the request is saved/restored,
  e.g. if userspace restores events (including a triple fault) and then
  restores nested state (which may forcibly leave guest mode).  Ignoring
  the fact that KVM doesn't currently provide the necessary APIs, it's
  userspace's responsibility to manage pending events during save/restore.
