aliases: []
summary: Invision Community through 4.7.16 allows remote code execution via the applications/core/modules/admin/editor/toolbar.php
  IPS\core\modules\admin\editor\_toolbar::addPlugin() method. This method handles uploaded ZIP
  files that are extracted into the applications/core/interface/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/ directory
  without properly verifying their content. This can be exploited by admin users (with the toolbar_manage
  permission) to write arbitrary PHP files into that directory, leading to execution of arbitrary
  PHP code in the context of the web server user.
