aliases: []
summary: A flaw was discovered in the RESTEasy Reactive implementation in Quarkus. Due to security
  checks for some JAX-RS endpoints being performed after serialization, more processing resources
  are consumed while the HTTP request is checked. In certain configurations, if an attacker
  has knowledge of any POST, PUT, or PATCH request paths, they can potentially identify vulnerable
  endpoints and trigger excessive resource usage as the endpoints process the requests. This
  can result in a denial of service.
