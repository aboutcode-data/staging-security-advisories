summary: "A vulnerability in the Dynamic Vectoring and Streaming (DVS) Engine implementation\
  \ of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an unauthenticated,\
  \ remote attacker to bypass the anti-malware scanner, allowing malicious archive files to\
  \ be downloaded.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain archive\
  \ files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted archive file, which\
  \ should be blocked, through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to bypass the anti-malware scanner and download malware onto an end user workstation. The\
  \ downloaded malware will not automatically execute unless the end user extracts and launches\
  \ the malicious file.&nbsp;"
