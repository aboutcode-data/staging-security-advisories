summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  block: fix memory leak in __blkdev_issue_zero_pages

  Move the fatal signal check before bio_alloc() to prevent a memory
  leak when BLKDEV_ZERO_KILLABLE is set and a fatal signal is pending.

  Previously, the bio was allocated before checking for a fatal signal.
  If a signal was pending, the code would break out of the loop without
  freeing or chaining the just-allocated bio, causing a memory leak.

  This matches the pattern already used in __blkdev_issue_write_zeroes()
  where the signal check precedes the allocation.
