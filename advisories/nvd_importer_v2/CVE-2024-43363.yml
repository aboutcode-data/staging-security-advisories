aliases: []
summary: Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. An admin user can
  create a device with a malicious hostname containing php code and repeat the installation
  process (completing only step 5 of the installation process is enough, no need to complete
  the steps before or after it) to use a php file as the cacti log file. After having the malicious
  hostname end up in the logs (log poisoning), one can simply go to the log file url to execute
  commands to achieve RCE. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.28 and all users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
