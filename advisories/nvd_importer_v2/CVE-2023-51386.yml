aliases: []
summary: Sandbox Accounts for Events provides multiple, temporary AWS accounts to a number of
  authenticated users simultaneously via a browser-based GUI. Authenticated users could potentially
  read data from the events table by sending request payloads to the events API, collecting
  information on planned events, timeframes, budgets and owner email addresses. This data access
  may allow users to get insights into upcoming events and join events which they have not been
  invited to. This issue has been patched in version 1.10.0.
