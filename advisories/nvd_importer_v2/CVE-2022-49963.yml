  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/i915/ttm: fix CCS handling

  Crucible + recent Mesa seems to sometimes hit:

  GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER)

  And it looks like we can also trigger this with gem_lmem_swapping, if we
  modify the test to use slightly larger object sizes.

  Looking closer it looks like we have the following issues in
  migrate_copy():

    - We are using plain integer in various places, which we can easily
      overflow with a large object.

    - We pass the entire object size (when the src is lmem) into
      emit_pte() and then try to copy it, which doesn't work, since we
      only have a few fixed sized windows in which to map the pages and
      perform the copy. With an object > 8M we therefore aren't properly
      copying the pages. And then with an object > 64M we trigger the
      GEM_BUG_ON(num_ccs_blks > NUM_CCS_BLKS_PER_XFER).

  So it looks like our copy handling for any object > 8M (which is our
  CHUNK_SZ) is currently broken on DG2.

  Testcase: igt@gem_lmem_swapping
  (cherry picked from commit 8676145eb2f53a9940ff70910caf0125bd8a4bc2)
