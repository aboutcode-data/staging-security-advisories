  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  gve: Implement gettimex64 with -EOPNOTSUPP

  gve implemented a ptp_clock for sole use of do_aux_work at this time.
  ptp_clock_gettime() and ptp_sys_offset() assume every ptp_clock has
  implemented either gettimex64 or gettime64. Stub gettimex64 and return
