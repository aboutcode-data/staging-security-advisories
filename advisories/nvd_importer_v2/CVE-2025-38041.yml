summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: sunxi-ng: h616: Reparent GPU clock during frequency changes

  The H616 manual does not state that the GPU PLL supports
  dynamic frequency configuration, so we must take extra care when changing
  the frequency. Currently any attempt to do device DVFS on the GPU lead
  to panfrost various ooops, and GPU hangs.

  The manual describes the algorithm for changing the PLL
  frequency, which the CPU PLL notifier code already support, so we reuse
  that to reparent the GPU clock to GPU1 clock during frequency
  changes.
