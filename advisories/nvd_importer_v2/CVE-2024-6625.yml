summary: The WP Total Branding – Complete branding solution for WordPress plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and
  including, 1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible

  web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only
  affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
