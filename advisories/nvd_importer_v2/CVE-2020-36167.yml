aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the server in Veritas Backup Exec through 16.2, 20.6 before
  hotfix 298543, and 21.1 before hotfix 657517. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from
  the Installation folder. This library in turn attempts to load the /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf
  configuration file, which may not exist. On Windows systems, this path could translate to
  <drive>:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf. A low privileged user can create a :\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf
  configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution
  as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system,
  allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications,
  etc. If the system is also an Active Directory domain controller, then this can affect the
  entire domain.
