aliases: []
summary: 'msgraph-sdk-php is the Microsoft Graph Library for PHP. The Microsoft Graph PHP SDK
  published packages which contained test code that enabled the use of the phpInfo() function
  from any application that could access and execute the file at vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php.  The
  phpInfo function exposes system information. The vulnerability affects the GetPhpInfo.php
  script of the PHP SDK which contains a call to the phpinfo() function. This vulnerability
  requires a misconfiguration of the server to be present so it can be exploited. For example,
  making the PHP application’s /vendor directory web accessible. The combination of the vulnerability
  and the server misconfiguration would allow an attacker to craft an HTTP request that executes
  the phpinfo() method. The attacker would then be able to get access to system information
  like configuration, modules, and environment variables and later on use the compromised secrets
  to access additional data. This problem has been patched in versions 1.109.1 and 2.0.0-RC5.
  If an immediate deployment with the updated vendor package is not available, you can perform
  the following temporary workarounds: delete the `vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php`
  file, remove access to the `/vendor` directory, or disable the phpinfo function.'
