  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/sev: Make enc_dec_hypercall() accept a size instead of npages

  enc_dec_hypercall() accepted a page count instead of a size, which
  forced its callers to round up. As a result, non-page aligned
  vaddrs caused pages to be spuriously marked as decrypted via the
  encryption status hypercall, which in turn caused consistent
  corruption of pages during live migration. Live migration requires
  accurate encryption status information to avoid migrating pages
  from the wrong perspective.
