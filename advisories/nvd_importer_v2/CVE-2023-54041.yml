  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  io_uring: fix memory leak when removing provided buffers

  When removing provided buffers, io_buffer structs are not being disposed
  of, leading to a memory leak. They can't be freed individually, because
  they are allocated in page-sized groups. They need to be added to some
  free list instead, such as io_buffers_cache. All callers already hold
  the lock protecting it, apart from when destroying buffers, so had to
  extend the lock there.
