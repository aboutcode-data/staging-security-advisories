aliases: []
summary: TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS)
  vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s core undo/redo functionality and other APIs and
  plugins. Text nodes within specific parents are not escaped upon serialization according to
  the HTML standard. If such text nodes contain a special character reserved as an internal
  marker, they can be combined with other HTML patterns to form malicious snippets. These snippets
  pass the initial sanitisation layer when the content is parsed into the editor body, but can
  trigger XSS when the special internal marker is removed from the content and re-parsed. his
  vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9. Users are advised to
  upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
