summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  rv: Fully convert enabled_monitors to use list_head as iterator

  The callbacks in enabled_monitors_seq_ops are inconsistent. Some treat the
  iterator as struct rv_monitor *, while others treat the iterator as struct
  list_head *.

  This causes a wrong type cast and crashes the system as reported by Nathan.

  Convert everything to use struct list_head * as iterator. This also makes
  enabled_monitors consistent with available_monitors.
