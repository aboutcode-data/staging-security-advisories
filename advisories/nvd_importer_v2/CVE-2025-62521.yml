aliases: []
summary: ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 5.21.0, a pre-authentication
  remote code execution vulnerability in ChurchCRM's setup wizard allows unauthenticated attackers
  to inject arbitrary PHP code during the initial installation process, leading to complete
  server compromise. The vulnerability exists in `setup/routes/setup.php` where user input from
  the setup form is directly concatenated into a PHP configuration template without any validation
  or sanitization. Any parameter in the setup form can be used to inject PHP code that gets
  written to `Include/Config.php`, which is then executed on every page load. This is more severe
  than typical authenticated RCE vulnerabilities because it requires no credentials and affects
  the installation process that administrators must complete. Version 5.21.0 patches the issue.
