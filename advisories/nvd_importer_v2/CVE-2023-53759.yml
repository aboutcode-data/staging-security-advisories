  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount

  The hidraw_open() function increments the hidraw device reference
  counter. The counter has no dedicated synchronization mechanism,
  resulting in a potential data race when concurrently opening a device.

  The race is a regression introduced by commit 8590222e4b02 ("HID:
  hidraw: Replace hidraw device table mutex with a rwsem"). While
  minors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead
  acquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.
  This is symmetrical to hidraw_release().
