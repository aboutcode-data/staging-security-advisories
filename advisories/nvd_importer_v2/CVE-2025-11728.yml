summary: The Oceanpayment CreditCard Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated
  and unauthorized modification of data due to missing authentication and capability checks
  on the 'return_payment' and 'notice_payment' functions in all versions up to, and including,

  'failed' status, and update transaction IDs.
