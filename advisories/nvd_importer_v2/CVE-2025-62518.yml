aliases: []
summary: astral-tokio-tar is a tar archive reading/writing library for async Rust. Versions
  of astral-tokio-tar prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing vulnerability that allows attackers
  to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling.
  When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly
  advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified
  size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers. This issue has been
  patched in version 0.5.6. There are no workarounds.
