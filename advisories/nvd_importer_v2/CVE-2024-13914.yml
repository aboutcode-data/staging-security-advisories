aliases: []
summary: The File Manager Advanced Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
  Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode) and
  2.5.6 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium), via the 'file_manager_advanced' shortcode. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above,
  to include and execute arbitrary JavaScript files on the server. This can be used to bypass
  access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and
  other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. Sites currently using 2.5.4 (file-manager-advanced-shortcode)
  should be updated to 2.6.0 (advanced-file-manager-pro-premium).
