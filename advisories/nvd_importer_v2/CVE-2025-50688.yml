aliases: []
summary: A command injection vulnerability exists in TwistedWeb (version 14.0.0) due to improper
  input sanitization in the file upload functionality. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a specially crafted HTTP PUT request to upload a malicious file (e.g., a reverse
  shell script). Once uploaded, the attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary commands
  on the target system, allowing for remote code execution. This could lead to escalation of
  privileges depending on the privileges of the web server process. The attack does not require
  physical access and can be conducted remotely, posing a significant risk to the confidentiality
  and integrity of the system.
