aliases: []
summary: 1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. Prior
  to  v1.10.3-lts, there are many command injections in the project, and some of them are not
  well filtered, leading to arbitrary file writes, and ultimately leading to RCEs. The mirror
  configuration write symbol `>` can be used to achieve arbitrary file writing. This vulnerability
  is fixed in  v1.10.3-lts.
