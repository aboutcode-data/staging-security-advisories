aliases: []
summary: Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Cursor allows writing in-workspace
  files with no user approval in versions below 1.3.9, If the file is a dotfile, editing it
  requires approval but creating a new one doesn't. Hence, if sensitive MCP files, such as the
  .cursor/mcp.json file don't already exist in the workspace, an attacker can chain a indirect
  prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger
  RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9.
