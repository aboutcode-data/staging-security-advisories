aliases: []
summary: Folo organizes feeds content into one timeline. Using pull_request_target on .github/workflows/auto-fix-lint-format-commit.yml
  can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to
  secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate GITHUB_TOKEN
  which has high privileges. GITHUB_TOKEN can be used to completely overtake the repo since
  the token has content write privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a.
