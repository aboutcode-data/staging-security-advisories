aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an
  authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the web-based interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface of the affected
  software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based
  interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
