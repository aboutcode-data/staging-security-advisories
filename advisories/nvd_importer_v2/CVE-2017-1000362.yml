aliases: []
summary: The re-key admin monitor was introduced in Jenkins 1.498 and re-encrypted all secrets
  in JENKINS_HOME with a new key. It also created a backup directory with all old secrets, and
  the key used to encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards.
  Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no
  longer create a backup directory. Administrators relying on file access permissions in their
  manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups,
  and delete it if present.
