aliases: []
summary: The WP Duplicate Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that
  a user is authorized to perform an action in the 'saveSettings' function. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify plugin settings
  that control role capabilities, and subsequently exploit the misconfigured capabilities to
  duplicate and view password-protected posts containing sensitive information.
