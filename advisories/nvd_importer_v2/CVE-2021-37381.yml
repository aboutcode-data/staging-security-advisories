aliases: []
summary: 'Southsoft GMIS 5.0 is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Attackers can access other users''
  private information such as photos through CSRF. For example: any student''s photo information
  can be accessed through /gmis/(S([1]))/student/grgl/PotoImageShow/?bh=[2]. Among them, the
  code in [1] is a random string generated according to the user''s login related information.
  It can protect the user''s identity, but it can not effectively prevent unauthorized access.
  The code in [2] is the student number of any student. The attacker can carry out CSRF attack
  on the system by modifying [2] without modifying [1].'
