aliases: []
summary: 'The Online-Ausweis-Funktion eID scheme in the German National Identity card through
  2024-02-15 allows authentication bypass by spoofing. A man-in-the-middle attacker can assume
  a victim''s identify for access to government, medical, and financial resources, and can also
  extract personal data from the card, aka the "sPACE (Spoofing Password Authenticated Connection
  Establishment)" issue. This occurs because of a combination of factors, such as insecure PIN
  entry (for basic readers) and eid:// deeplinking. The victim must be using a modified eID
  kernel, which may occur if the victim is tricked into installing a fake version of an official
  app. NOTE: the BSI position is "ensuring a secure operational environment at the client side
  is an obligation of the ID card owner."'
