summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: accel: bmc150: Fix irq assumption regression

  The code in bmc150-accel-core.c unconditionally calls
  bmc150_accel_set_interrupt() in the iio_buffer_setup_ops,
  such as on the runtime PM resume path giving a kernel
  splat like this if the device has no interrupts:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
    address 00000001 when read

  PC is at bmc150_accel_set_interrupt+0x98/0x194
  LR is at __pm_runtime_resume+0x5c/0x64
  (...)
  Call trace:
  bmc150_accel_set_interrupt from bmc150_accel_buffer_postenable+0x40/0x108
  bmc150_accel_buffer_postenable from __iio_update_buffers+0xbe0/0xcbc
  __iio_update_buffers from enable_store+0x84/0xc8
  enable_store from kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x154/0x1b4

  This bug seems to have been in the driver since the beginning,
  but it only manifests recently, I do not know why.

  Store the IRQ number in the state struct, as this is a common
  pattern in other drivers, then use this to determine if we have
  IRQ support or not.
