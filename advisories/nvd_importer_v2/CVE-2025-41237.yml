summary: VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain an integer-underflow in VMCI (Virtual
  Machine Communication Interface) that leads to an out-of-bounds write. A malicious actor with
  local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code
  as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. On ESXi, the exploitation is contained
  within the VMX sandbox whereas, on Workstation and Fusion, this may lead to code execution
  on the machine where Workstation or Fusion is installed.
