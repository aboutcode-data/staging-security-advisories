summary: "The User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User\
  \ Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's\
  \ shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.5 due to insufficient input sanitization\
  \ and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated\
  \ attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages\
  \ that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\r\nThe issue was partially\
  \ patched in version 3.13.6 of the plugin, and fully patched in 3.13.7."
