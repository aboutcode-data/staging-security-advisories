summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ASoC: stm32: sai: fix OF node leak on probe

  The reference taken to the sync provider OF node when probing the
  platform device is currently only dropped if the set_sync() callback
  fails during DAI probe.

  Make sure to drop the reference on platform probe failures (e.g. probe
  deferral) and on driver unbind.

  This also avoids a potential use-after-free in case the DAI is ever
  reprobed without first rebinding the platform driver.
