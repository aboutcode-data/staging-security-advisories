aliases: []
summary: The Realty Portal – Agent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation
  due to missing authorization within the rp_user_profile() AJAX handler in versions 0.1.0 through
  0.3.9. The handler reads the client-supplied meta key and value pairs from $_POST and passes
  them directly to update_user_meta() without restricting to a safe whitelist. This makes it
  possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite
  the wp_capabilities meta and grant themselves the administrator role.
