aliases: []
summary: 'In Combodo iTop 2.2.0 through 2.6.0, if the configuration file is writable, then execution
  of arbitrary code can be accomplished by calling ajax.dataloader with a maliciously crafted
  payload. Many conditions can place the configuration file into a writable state: during installation;
  during upgrade; in certain cases, an error during modification of the file from the web interface
  leaves the file writable (can be triggered with XSS); a race condition can be triggered by
  the hub-connector module (community version only from 2.4.1 to 2.6.0); or editing the file
  in a CLI.'
