  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/slub: reset KASAN tag in defer_free() before accessing freed memory

  When CONFIG_SLUB_TINY is enabled, kfree_nolock() calls kasan_slab_free()
  before defer_free(). On ARM64 with MTE (Memory Tagging Extension),
  kasan_slab_free() poisons the memory and changes the tag from the
  original (e.g., 0xf3) to a poison tag (0xfe).

  When defer_free() then tries to write to the freed object to build the
  deferred free list via llist_add(), the pointer still has the old tag,
  causing a tag mismatch and triggering a KASAN use-after-free report:

    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in defer_free+0x3c/0xbc mm/slub.c:6537
    Write at addr f3f000000854f020 by task kworker/u8:6/983
    Pointer tag: [f3], memory tag: [fe]

  Fix this by calling kasan_reset_tag() before accessing the freed memory.
  This is safe because defer_free() is part of the allocator itself and is
  expected to manipulate freed memory for bookkeeping purposes.
