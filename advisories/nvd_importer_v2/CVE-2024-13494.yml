summary: The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.25.2. This is due to missing or incorrect

  attackers to modify user data details associated with uploaded files via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
