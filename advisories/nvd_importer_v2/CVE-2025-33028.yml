aliases: []
summary: 'In WinZip through 29.0, there is a Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability because of
  an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-8811. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web
  protection mechanism on affected installations of WinZip. User interaction is required to
  exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious
  file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files
  from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, WinZip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web
  to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
  in the context of the current user. NOTE: a third party has reported that this is a false
  positive, and has observed that the original CVE-2025-33028.md file has been deleted on GitHub.
  Also, this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning
  habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl
  in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file''s content.'
