aliases: []
summary: DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) is an open-source web content management platform (CMS) in
  the Microsoft ecosystem. Prior to version 10.1.0, DNN’s URL/path handling and template rendering
  can allow specially crafted input to be reflected into a user profile that is returned to
  the browser. In these cases, the application does not sufficiently neutralize or encode characters
  that are meaningful in HTML, so an attacker can cause a victim’s browser to interpret attacker-controlled
  content as part of the page’s HTML. This issue has been patched in version 10.1.0.
