summary: The AP Background plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation

  attackers to create or modify background sliders via a forged request granted they can trick
  a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
