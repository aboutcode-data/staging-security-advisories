aliases: []
summary: 'A flaw was found in the xdg-email component of xdg-utils-1.1.0-rc1 and newer. When
  handling mailto: URIs, xdg-email allows attachments to be discreetly added via the URI when
  being passed to Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially send a victim a URI that automatically
  attaches a sensitive file to a new email. If a victim user does not notice that an attachment
  was added and sends the email, this could result in sensitive information disclosure. It has
  been confirmed that the code behind this issue is in xdg-email and not in Thunderbird.'
