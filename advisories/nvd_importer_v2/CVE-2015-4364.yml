summary: 'Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in includes/campaignmonitor_lists.admin.inc
  in the Campaign Monitor module 7.x-1.0 for Drupal allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication
  of users for requests that (1) enable list subscriptions via a request to admin/config/services/campaignmonitor/lists/%/enable
  or (2) disable list subscriptions via a request to admin/config/services/campaignmonitor/lists/%/disable.
