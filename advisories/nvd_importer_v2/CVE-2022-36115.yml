aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured
  environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated
  user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for unintended
  functionality. An attacker can abuse the CreateProcessAutosave() method to inject their own
  functionality into a development process. If (upon a warning) a user decides to recover unsaved
  work by using the last saved version, the malicious code could enter the workflow. Should
  the process action stages not be fully reviewed before publishing, this could result in the
  malicious code being run in a production environment.
