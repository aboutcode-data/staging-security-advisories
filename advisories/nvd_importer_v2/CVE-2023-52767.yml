  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tls: fix NULL deref on tls_sw_splice_eof() with empty record

  syzkaller discovered that if tls_sw_splice_eof() is executed as part of
  sendfile() when the plaintext/ciphertext sk_msg are empty, the send path
  gets confused because the empty ciphertext buffer does not have enough
  space for the encryption overhead. This causes tls_push_record() to go on
  the `split = true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting
  with an attached BPF program), and then get further confused and hit the
  tls_merge_open_record() path, which then assumes that there must be at
  least one populated buffer element, leading to a NULL deref.

  It is possible to have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously
  bailed from tls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path.
  tls_sw_push_pending_record() already handles this case correctly; let's do
  the same check in tls_sw_splice_eof().
