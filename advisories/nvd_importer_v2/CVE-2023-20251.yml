summary: "A vulnerability in the memory buffer of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) AireOS\
  \ Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause memory leaks that could\
  \ eventually lead to a device reboot.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to memory leaks caused\
  \ by multiple clients connecting under specific conditions. An attacker could exploit this\
  \ vulnerability by causing multiple wireless clients to attempt to connect to an access point\
  \ (AP) on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected\
  \ device to reboot after a significant amount of time, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)\
  \ condition."
