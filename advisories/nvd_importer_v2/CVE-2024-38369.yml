aliases: []
summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. The content of a document included using `{{include reference="targetdocument"/}}`
  is executed with the right of the includer and not with the right of its author. This means
  that any user able to modify the target document can impersonate the author of the content
  which used the `include` macro. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0 RC1 by making
  the default behavior safe.
