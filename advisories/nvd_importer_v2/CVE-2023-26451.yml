aliases: []
summary: Functions with insufficient randomness were used to generate authorization tokens of
  the integrated oAuth Authorization Service. Authorization codes were predictable for third
  parties and could be used to intercept and take over the client authorization process. As
  a result, other users accounts could be compromised. The oAuth Authorization Service is not
  enabled by default. We have updated the implementation to use sources with sufficient randomness
  to generate authorization tokens. No publicly available exploits are known.
