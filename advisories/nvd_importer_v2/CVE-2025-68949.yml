aliases: []
summary: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. From 1.36.0 to before 2.2.0, the
  Webhook node’s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact
  IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address
  merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring. This issue affected instances
  where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both
  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass
  restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended
  security boundary. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.0.
