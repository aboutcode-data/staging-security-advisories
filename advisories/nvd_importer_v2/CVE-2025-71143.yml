  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  clk: samsung: exynos-clkout: Assign .num before accessing .hws

  Commit f316cdff8d67 ("clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with
  __counted_by") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'
  with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer (UBSAN_BOUNDS)
  about the number of elements in .hws[], so that it can warn when .hws[]
  is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by
  member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first
  array access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access
  prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This
  occurs in exynos_clkout_probe() due to .num being assigned after .hws[]
  has been accessed:

    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/samsung/clk-exynos-clkout.c:178:18
    index 0 is out of range for type 'clk_hw *[*]'

  Move the .num initialization to before the first access of .hws[],
  clearing up the warning.
