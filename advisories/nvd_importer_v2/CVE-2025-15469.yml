summary: |
  Issue summary: The 'openssl dgst' command-line tool silently truncates input
  data to 16MB when using one-shot signing algorithms and reports success instead
  of an error.

  Impact summary: A user signing or verifying files larger than 16MB with
  one-shot algorithms (such as Ed25519, Ed448, or ML-DSA) may believe the entire
  file is authenticated while trailing data beyond 16MB remains unauthenticated.

  When the 'openssl dgst' command is used with algorithms that only support
  one-shot signing (Ed25519, Ed448, ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, ML-DSA-87), the input
  is buffered with a 16MB limit. If the input exceeds this limit, the tool
  silently truncates to the first 16MB and continues without signaling an error,
  contrary to what the documentation states. This creates an integrity gap where
  trailing bytes can be modified without detection if both signing and
  verification are performed using the same affected codepath.

  The issue affects only the command-line tool behavior. Verifiers that process
  the full message using library APIs will reject the signature, so the risk
  primarily affects workflows that both sign and verify with the affected
  'openssl dgst' command. Streaming digest algorithms for 'openssl dgst' and
  library users are unaffected.

  The FIPS modules in 3.5 and 3.6 are not affected by this issue, as the
  command-line tools are outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.

  OpenSSL 3.5 and 3.6 are vulnerable to this issue.

  OpenSSL 3.4, 3.3, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.
