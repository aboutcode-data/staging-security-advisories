summary: "Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner. Prior to version 2.9.9, a security issue in the\
  \ Nuclei project affected users utilizing Nuclei as Go code (SDK) running custom templates.\
  \ This issue did not affect CLI users. The problem was related to sanitization issues with\
  \ payload loading in sandbox mode. There was a potential risk with payloads loading in sandbox\
  \ mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being converted to absolute paths before\
  \ doing the check for `sandbox` flag allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem\
  \ in certain cases when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation. \n\nThis issue has been\
  \ fixed in version 2.9.9. The maintainers have also enabled sandbox by default for filesystem\
  \ loading. This can be optionally disabled if required. The `-sandbox` option has been deprecated\
  \ and is now divided into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is enabled\
  \ by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which can be enabled by users optionally.\
  \ The `-lfa` allows file (payload) access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively),\
  \ and `-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network."
