aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the Operations, Administration, Maintenance and Provisioning (OAMP)
  OpsConsole Server for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) could allow an authenticated,
  remote attacker to execute Insecure Direct Object Reference actions on specific pages within
  the OAMP application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on specific
  pages of the OAMP application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
  to Cisco Unified CVP and sending crafted HTTP requests. A successful exploit could allow an
  attacker with administrator or read-only privileges to learn information outside of their
  expected scope. An attacker with administrator privileges could modify certain configuration
  details of resources outside of their defined scope, which could result in a denial of service
  (DoS) condition.
