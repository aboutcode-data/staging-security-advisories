summary: The WP-Iconics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  multiple parameters of the 'wp_iconics' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.0.4
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
  that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
