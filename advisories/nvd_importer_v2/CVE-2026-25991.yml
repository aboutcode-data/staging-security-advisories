aliases: []
summary: Tandoor Recipes is an application for managing recipes, planning meals, and building
  shopping lists. Prior to 2.5.1, there is a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
  in the Cookmate recipe import feature of Tandoor Recipes. The application fails to validate
  the destination URL after following HTTP redirects, allowing any authenticated user (including
  standard users without administrative privileges) to force the server to connect to arbitrary
  internal or external resources. The vulnerability lies in cookbook/integration/cookmate.py,
  within the Cookmate integration class. This vulnerability can be leveraged to scan internal
  network ports, access cloud instance metadata (e.g., AWS/GCP Metadata Service), or disclose
  the server's real IP address. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.1.
