aliases: []
summary: Underscore.deep is a collection of Underscore mixins that operate on nested objects.
  Versions of `underscore.deep` prior to version 0.5.3 are vulnerable to a prototype pollution
  vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious payload and pass it to `deepFromFlat`, which
  would pollute any future Objects created. Any users that have `deepFromFlat` or `deepPick`
  (due to its dependency on `deepFromFlat`) in their code should upgrade to version 0.5.3 as
  soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by modifying `deepFromFlat`
  to prevent specific keywords which will prevent this from happening.
