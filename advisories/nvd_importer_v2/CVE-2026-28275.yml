aliases: []
summary: Initiative is a self-hosted project management platform. Versions of the application
  prior to 0.32.4 do not invalidate previously issued JWT access tokens after a user changes
  their password. As a result, older tokens remain valid until expiration and can still be used
  to access protected API endpoints. This behavior allows continued authenticated access even
  after the account password has been updated. Version 0.32.4 fixes the issue.
