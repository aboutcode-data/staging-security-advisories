aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that
  could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration options
  used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to override environment
  variables leading to code execution on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this
  vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on
  the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub
  Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.3 and was fixed in 3.0.3, 2.22.9, and 2.21.17. This vulnerability
  was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
