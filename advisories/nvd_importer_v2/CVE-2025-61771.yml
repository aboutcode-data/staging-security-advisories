aliases: []
summary: Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and
  3.2.2, ``Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields (parts without a `filename`)
  entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A single large text field in a multipart/form-data
  request (hundreds of megabytes or more) can consume equivalent process memory, potentially
  leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial of service (DoS). Attackers can send
  large non-file fields to trigger excessive memory usage. Impact scales with request size and
  concurrency, potentially leading to worker crashes or severe garbage-collection overhead.
  All Rack applications processing multipart form submissions are affected. Versions 2.2.19,
  3.1.17, and 3.2.2 enforce a reasonable size cap for non-file fields (e.g., 2 MiB). Workarounds
  include restricting maximum request body size at the web-server or proxy layer (e.g., Nginx
  `client_max_body_size`) and validating and rejecting unusually large form fields at the application
  level.
