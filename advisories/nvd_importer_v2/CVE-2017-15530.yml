aliases: []
summary: Prior to 4.4.1.10, the Norton Family Android App can be susceptible to an Information
  Disclosure issue. Information disclosure is a very common issue that attackers will attempt
  to exploit as a first pass across the application. As they probe the application they will
  take note of anything that may seem out of place or any bit of information they can use to
  their advantage such as error messages, system information, user data, version numbers, component
  names, URL paths, or even simple typos and misspellings.
