summary: The Kentico Xperience CMS version 13.0 – 13.0.43 is vulnerable to a persistent Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (also known as Stored or Second-Order XSS). Persistent XSS vulnerabilities
  occur when the application stores and retrieves client supplied data without proper handling
  of dangerous content. This type of XSS vulnerability is exploited by submitting malicious
  script content to the application which is then retrieved and executed by other application
  users. The attacker could exploit this to conduct a range of attacks against users of the
  affected application such as session hijacking, account take over and accessing sensitive
  data.
