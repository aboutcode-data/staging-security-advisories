aliases: []
summary: The Bastion provides authentication, authorization, traceability and auditability for
  SSH accesses. SCP and SFTP plugins don't honor group-based JIT MFA. Establishing a SCP/SFTP
  connection through The Bastion via a group access where MFA is enforced does not ask for additional
  factor. This abnormal behavior only applies to per-group-based JIT MFA. Other MFA setup types,
  such as Immediate MFA, JIT MFA on a per-plugin basis and JIT MFA on a per-account basis are
  not affected. This issue has been patched in version 3.14.15.
