aliases: []
summary: In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the
  name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that
  took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable
  in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage
  exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an
  encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use
  the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed
  the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically
  provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force
  the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468).
