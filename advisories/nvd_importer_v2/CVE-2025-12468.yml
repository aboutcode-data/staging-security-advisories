aliases: []
summary: The FunnelKit Automations – Email Marketing Automation and CRM for WordPress & WooCommerce
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to,
  and including, 3.6.4.1 via the '/wc-coupons/' REST API endpoint. This is due to the endpoint
  being marked as a public API (`public_api = true`), which results in the endpoint being registered
  with `permission_callback => '__return_true'`, bypassing all authentication and capability
  checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including
  all WooCommerce coupon codes, coupon IDs, and expiration status.
