aliases: []
summary: SoLive 1.6.14 thru 1.6.20 for Android has an exposed component that provides a method
  to modify the SharedPreference file. An attacker can leverage this method to inject a large
  amount of data into any SharedPreference file, which will be loaded into memory when the application
  is opened. When an attacker injects too much data, the application will trigger an OOM error
  and crash at startup, resulting in a persistent denial of service.
