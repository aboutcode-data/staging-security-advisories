aliases: []
summary: ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6,
  if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions
  and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The
  vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes.
  In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class.
  The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call
  `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes
  by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the
  exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object
  properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.
