summary: "SkillTree is a micro-learning gamification platform. Prior to version 2.12.6, the\
  \ endpoint \n`/admin/projects/{projectname}/skills/{skillname}/video` (and probably others)\
  \ is open to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Due to the endpoint being\
  \ CSRFable e.g POST request, supports a content type that can be exploited (multipart file\
  \ upload), makes a state change and has no CSRF mitigations in place (samesite flag, CSRF\
  \ token). It is possible to perform a CSRF attack against a logged in admin account, allowing\
  \ an attacker that can target a logged in admin of Skills Service to modify the videos, captions,\
  \ and text of the skill. Version 2.12.6 contains a patch for this issue."
