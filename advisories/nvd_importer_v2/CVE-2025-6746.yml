aliases: []
summary: The WoodMart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 8.2.3 via the 'layout' attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php
  files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used
  to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where
  .php files can be uploaded and included.
