summary: 'An issue in H3C Device R365V300R004 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
  code via the default password. NOTE: the Supplier''s position is that their "product lines
  enforce or clearly prompt users to change any initial credentials upon first use. At most,
  this would be a case of misconfiguration if an administrator deliberately ignored the prompts,
  which is outside the scope of CVE definitions."'
