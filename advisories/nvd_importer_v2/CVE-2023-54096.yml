  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  soundwire: fix enumeration completion

  The soundwire subsystem uses two completion structures that allow
  drivers to wait for soundwire device to become enumerated on the bus and
  initialised by their drivers, respectively.

  The code implementing the signalling is currently broken as it does not
  signal all current and future waiters and also uses the wrong
  reinitialisation function, which can potentially lead to memory
  corruption if there are still waiters on the queue.

  Not signalling future waiters specifically breaks sound card probe
  deferrals as codec drivers can not tell that the soundwire device is
  already attached when being reprobed. Some codec runtime PM
  implementations suffer from similar problems as waiting for enumeration
  during resume can also timeout despite the device already having been
  enumerated.
