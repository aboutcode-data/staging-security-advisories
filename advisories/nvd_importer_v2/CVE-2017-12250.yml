aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the HTTP web interface for Cisco Wide Area Application Services
  (WAAS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an HTTP Application Optimization
  (AO) related process to restart, causing a partial denial of service (DoS) condition. The
  vulnerability is due to lack of input validation of user-supplied input parameters within
  an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request
  through the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition
  due to a process unexpectedly restarting. The WAAS could drop traffic during the brief time
  the process is restarting. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc63048.'
