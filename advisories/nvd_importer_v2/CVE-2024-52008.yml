aliases: []
summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The user invite acceptance API
  endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily
  weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity
  requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts
  with passwords as short as a single character. When an email messaging provider is enabled
  and a new user account is created in the system, an invite email containing a special link
  is sent to the new user's email address. This link directs the new user to a page where they
  can set their initial password. While the user interface implements password complexity checks,
  these validations are only performed client-side. The underlying `/api/v1/user/accept-invite`
  API endpoint does not implement the same password policy validations. This vulnerability allows
  an invited user to set an extremely weak password for their own account during the initial
  account setup process. Therefore that specific user's account can be compromised easily by
  an attacker guessing or brute forcing the password. The vulnerability has been patched in
  Fides version `2.50.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their
  systems against this threat. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
