aliases: []
summary: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In affected versions
  `sendOverloadError` is going to assume the active request exists when `envoy.load_shed_points.http1_server_abort_dispatch`
  is configured. If `active_request` is nullptr, only onMessageBeginImpl() is called. However,
  the `onMessageBeginImpl` will directly return ok status if the stream is already reset leading
  to the nullptr reference. The downstream reset can actually happen during the H/2 upstream
  reset. As a result envoy may crash. This issue has been addressed in releases 1.32.3, 1.31.5,
  1.30.9, and 1.29.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `http1_server_abort_dispatch`
  load shed point and/or use a high threshold.
