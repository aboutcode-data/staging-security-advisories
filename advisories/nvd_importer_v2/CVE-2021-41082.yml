summary: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private
  message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do
  not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages
  was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message
  despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after
  it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse
  against the `tests-passed` branch.
