aliases: []
summary: In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0, an endpoint exposing a custom EncryptionTool allows
  an attacker to encrypt any files on the target server with a key of their choosing. The chosen
  key can also be overwritten, resulting in ransomware-like behavior. This vulnerability makes
  it possible for an attacker to encrypt arbitrary files with keys of their choice, making it
  exceedingly difficult for the target to recover the keys needed for decryption.
