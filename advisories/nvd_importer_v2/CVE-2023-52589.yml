  media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue

  In rkisp1_isp_stop() and rkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks the
  interrupts and then apparently assumes that the interrupt handler won't
  be running, and proceeds in the stop procedure. This is not the case, as
  the interrupt handler can already be running, which would lead to the
  ISP being disabled while the interrupt handler handling a captured
  frame.

  This brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while the
  interrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading to
  board lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code that
  disables the streaming might do things that conflict.

  It is not clear to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can be seen with
  a suitable delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler,
  leading to board lockup.
