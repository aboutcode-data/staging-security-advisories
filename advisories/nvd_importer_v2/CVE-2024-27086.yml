aliases: []
summary: "The MSAL library enabled acquisition of security tokens to call protected APIs. MSAL.NET\
  \ applications targeting Xamarin Android and .NET Android (e.g., MAUI) using the library from\
  \ versions 4.48.0 to 4.60.0 are impacted by a low severity vulnerability.   \nA malicious\
  \ application running on a customer Android device    can cause local denial of service against\
  \ applications that were built using MSAL.NET for authentication on the same device (i.e.,\
  \ prevent the user of the legitimate application from logging in) due to incorrect activity\
  \ export configuration. MSAL.NET version 4.60.1 includes the fix.  As a workaround, a developer\
  \ may explicitly mark the MSAL.NET activity non-exported."
