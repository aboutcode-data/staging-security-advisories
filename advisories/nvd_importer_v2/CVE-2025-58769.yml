aliases: []
summary: auth0-PHP is an SDK for Auth0 Authentication and Management APIs. In versions 3.3.0
  through 8.16.0, the Bulk User Import endpoint in applications built with the SDK does not
  validate the file-path wrapper or value. Without proper validation, affected applications
  may accept arbitrary file paths or URLs. The vulnerability affects any application that either
  directly uses the Auth0-PHP SDK (versions 3.3.0–8.16.0) or indirectly relies on those versions
  through the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0, or Auth0/wordpress SDKs. This issue is fixed
  in version 8.17.0.
