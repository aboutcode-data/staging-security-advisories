aliases: []
summary: Norton Remove & Reinstall can be susceptible to a DLL preloading vulnerability. These
  types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker
  provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it
  will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited
  by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running
  under the context of the application. A Norton Remove & Reinstall update, version 4.4.0.58,
  has been released which addresses the aforementioned vulnerability.
