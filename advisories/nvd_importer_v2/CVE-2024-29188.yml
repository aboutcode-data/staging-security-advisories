aliases: []
summary: WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer, the Windows installation
  engine. The custom action behind WiX's `RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard
  user to delete protected directories. `RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory tree during
  installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing every subdirectory starting at a specified
  directory and adding each subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should
  delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a per-user folder from a
  per-machine installer, an attacker could create a directory junction in that per-user folder
  pointing to a per-machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the per-machine
  installer after approval by an administrator, would delete the target of the directory junction.
  This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5.
