aliases: []
summary: Gotify server is a simple server for sending and receiving messages in real-time per
  WebSocket. Versions prior to 2.2.2 contain an XSS vulnerability that allows authenticated
  users to upload .html files. An attacker could execute client side scripts **if** another
  user opened a link. The attacker could potentially take over the account of the user that
  clicked the link. The Gotify UI won't natively expose such a malicious link, so an attacker
  has to get the user to open the malicious link in a context outside of Gotify. The vulnerability
  has been fixed in version 2.2.2. As a workaround, you can block access to non image files
  via a reverse proxy in the `./image` directory.
