aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net/mlx5: Devcom, fix error flow in mlx5_devcom_register_device

  In case devcom allocation is failed, mlx5 is always freeing the priv.
  However, this priv might have been allocated by a different thread,
  and freeing it might lead to use-after-free bugs.
  Fix it by freeing the priv only in case it was allocated by the
  running thread.
