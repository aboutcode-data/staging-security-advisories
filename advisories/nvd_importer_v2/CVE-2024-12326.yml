aliases: []
summary: Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for SVG files due to the possibility that
  manipulated SVG files could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing
  the MIME type of a file and preventing the browser preview for MIME type image/svg+xml. This
  issue was first reported in CVE-2022-30110. However, it was still possible to do a browser
  preview of a SVG file by sending a manipulated MIME type during the upload, where the case
  of any letter in image/svg+xml had been changed (like image/svg+XML). The check for image/svg+xml
  has been changed to be case insensitive.
