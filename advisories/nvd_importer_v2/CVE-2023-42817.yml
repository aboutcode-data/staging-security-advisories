aliases: []
summary: Pimcore admin-ui-classic-bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. The translation
  value with text including “%s” (from “%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it’s supposed
  to be output literally to the user. The translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively
  lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain “modules”)
  and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the
  dialog box. This issue has been patched in commit `abd77392` which is included in release
  1.1.2. Users are advised to update to version 1.1.2 or apply the patch manually.
