aliases: []
summary: The EasyCommerce – AI-Powered, Fast & Beautiful WordPress Ecommerce Plugin plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in versions 0.9.0-beta2 to 1.5.0. This is
  due to the /easycommerce/v1/orders REST API endpoint not properly restricting the ability
  for users to select roles during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to gain administrator-level access to a vulnerable site.
