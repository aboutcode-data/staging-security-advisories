aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8. Setting the
  user's name to JS code makes that code execute when selecting that user's "Templates" folder
  from OX Documents settings. This requires the folder to be shared to the victim. Malicious
  script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or
  triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).
