summary: A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in
  a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction
  with certain elements (such as &lt;input type="file"&gt;) this could have led to an attack
  where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information
  they did not intend to. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.
