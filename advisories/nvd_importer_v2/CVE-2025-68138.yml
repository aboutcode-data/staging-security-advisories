aliases: []
summary: EVerest is an EV charging software stack, and EVerest libocpp is a C++ implementation
  of the Open Charge Point Protocol. In libocpp prior to version 0.30.1, pointers returned by
  the `strdup` calls are never freed. At each connection attempt, the newly allocated memory
  area will be leaked, potentially causing memory exhaustion and denial of service. Version
  0.30.1 fixes the issue.
