summary: "Pentaho Business Analytics\n Server versions before 9.2.0.2 and 8.3.0.25 using the\
  \ Pentaho \nAnalyzer plugin exposes a service endpoint for templates which allows a \nuser-supplied\
  \ path to access resources that are out of bounds. \n\nThe software uses external input to\
  \ construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or \ndirectory that is located\
  \ underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not \nproperly neutralize\
  \ special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to \nresolve to a location\
  \ that is outside of the restricted directory.  By using special elements such as \n\"..\"\
  \ and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted \nlocation to access\
  \ files or directories that are elsewhere on the \nsystem."
