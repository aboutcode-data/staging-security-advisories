aliases: []
summary: OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version
  3.8.3, the built-in "Something went wrong!" error page includes the exception message and
  exception traceback without escaping HTML tags, enabling injection into the page if an attacker
  can reliably produce an error with an attacker-influenced message. It appears that the only
  way to reach this code in OpenRefine itself is for an attacker to somehow convince a victim
  to import a malicious file, which may be difficult.  However, out-of-tree extensions may add
  their own calls to `respondWithErrorPage`. Version 3.8.3 has a fix for this issue.
