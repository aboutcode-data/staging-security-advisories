aliases: []
summary: The UltimateAI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.8.3. This is due to the improper empty value check and a missing default
  activated value check in the 'ultimate_ai_change_pass' function. This makes it possible for
  unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of the first user, whose account is not yet
  activated or the first user who activated their account, who are subscribers.
