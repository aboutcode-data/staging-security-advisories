aliases: []
summary: The Folders Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to
  missing file type validation in the 'handle_folders_file_upload' function in all versions
  up to, and including, 3.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author
  access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote
  code execution possible.
