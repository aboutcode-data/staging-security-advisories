  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: netpoll: fix incorrect refcount handling causing incorrect cleanup

  commit efa95b01da18 ("netpoll: fix use after free") incorrectly
  ignored the refcount and prematurely set dev->npinfo to NULL during
  netpoll cleanup, leading to improper behavior and memory leaks.

  Scenario causing lack of proper cleanup:

  1) A netpoll is associated with a NIC (e.g., eth0) and netdev->npinfo is
     allocated, and refcnt = 1
     - Keep in mind that npinfo is shared among all netpoll instances. In
       this case, there is just one.

  2) Another netpoll is also associated with the same NIC and
     npinfo->refcnt += 1.
     - Now dev->npinfo->refcnt = 2;
     - There is just one npinfo associated to the netdev.

  3) When the first netpolls goes to clean up:
     - The first cleanup succeeds and clears np->dev->npinfo, ignoring
       refcnt.
       - It basically calls `RCU_INIT_POINTER(np->dev->npinfo, NULL);`
     - Set dev->npinfo = NULL, without proper cleanup
     - No ->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() is either called

  4) Now the second target tries to clean up
     - The second cleanup fails because np->dev->npinfo is already NULL.
       * In this case, ops->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() was never called, and
         the skb pool is not cleaned as well (for the second netpoll
         instance)
    - This leaks npinfo and skbpool skbs, which is clearly reported by
      kmemleak.

  Revert commit efa95b01da18 ("netpoll: fix use after free") and adds
  clarifying comments emphasizing that npinfo cleanup should only happen
  once the refcount reaches zero, ensuring stable and correct netpoll
  behavior.
