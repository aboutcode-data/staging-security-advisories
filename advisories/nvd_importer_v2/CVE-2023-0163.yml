summary: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\
  \ vulnerability in Mozilla Convict.\n\nThis allows an attacker to inject attributes that are\
  \ used in other components, or to override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible\
  \ type, which may lead to a crash.\n\n\nThe main use case of Convict is for handling server-side\
  \ \nconfigurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random \nusers. So it's\
  \ unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their \nown server. Still, a situation\
  \ can happen where an admin not \nknowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker\
  \ into \nwriting the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects\
  \ Convict: before 6.2.4."
