summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco Network Plug-and-Play (PnP) agent
  of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information
  in clear text. The attacker must have valid low-privileged user credentials. This vulnerability
  is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) with the integration of PnP. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and sending a query to an
  internal API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information
  in clear text, which could include configuration files.
