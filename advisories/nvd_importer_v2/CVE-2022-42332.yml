summary: x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where host assisted address
  translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run guests
  in so called shadow mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page
  tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests, Xen additionally
  runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking
  are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable
  bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front
  that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page
  table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing
  of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration.
  As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other
  code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.
