summary: The Homey Login Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to the plugin allowing users who
  are registering new accounts to set their own role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the administrator role.
