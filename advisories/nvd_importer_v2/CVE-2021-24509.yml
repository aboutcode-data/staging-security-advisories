aliases: []
summary: The Page View Count WordPress plugin before 2.4.9 does not escape the postid parameter
  of pvc_stats shortcode, allowing users with a role as low as Contributor to perform Stored
  XSS attacks. A post made by a contributor would still have to be approved by an admin to have
  the XSS triggered in the frontend, however, higher privilege users, such as editor could exploit
  this without the need of approval, and even when the blog disallows the unfiltered_html capability.
