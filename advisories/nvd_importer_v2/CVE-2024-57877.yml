  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POE

  Currently poe_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl' variable,
  and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this
  uninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to
  target->thread.por_el0, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from
  the kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,
  and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.

  Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset
  from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,
  NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing
  contents of POR_EL1 will be retained.

  Before this patch:

  | # ./poe-test
  | Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d
  | SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes
  |
  | Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0
  | GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes
  | Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d
  |
  | Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)
  | SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes
  |
  | Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0
  | GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes
  | Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0xffff8000839c3d50

  After this patch:

  | # ./poe-test
