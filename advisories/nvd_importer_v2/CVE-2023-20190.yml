aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the classic access control list (ACL) compression feature of Cisco\
  \ IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the protection\
  \ that is offered by a configured ACL on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due\
  \ to incorrect destination address range encoding in the compression module of an ACL that\
  \ is applied to an interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the\
  \ affected device, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might\
  \ be protecting.\r\n\r   There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r   \r\
  \n\r \r This advisory is part of the September 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security\
  \ Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see\
  \ Cisco Event Response: September 2023 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory\
