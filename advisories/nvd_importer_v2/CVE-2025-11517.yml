aliases: []
summary: The Event Tickets and Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to payment bypass
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.26.5. This is due to the /wp-json/tribe/tickets/v1/commerce/free/order
  endpoint not verifying that a ticket type should be free allowing the user to bypass the payment.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain access to paid tickets, without
  paying for them, causing a loss of revenue for the target.
