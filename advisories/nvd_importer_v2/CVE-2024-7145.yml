aliases: []
summary: The JetElements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.6.20 via the 'progress_type' parameter. This makes it possible for
  authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary
  files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used
  to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where
  images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
