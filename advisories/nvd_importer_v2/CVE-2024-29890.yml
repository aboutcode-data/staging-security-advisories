aliases: []
summary: DataLens is a business intelligence and data visualization system. A specifically crafted
  request allowed the creation of a special chart type with the ability to pass custom javascript
  code that would later be executed in an unprotected sandbox on subsequent requests to that
  chart. The problem was fixed in the datalens-ui version `0.1449.0`. Restricting access to
  the API for creating or modifying charts (`/charts/api/charts/v1/`) would mitigate the issue.
