aliases: []
summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior
  to 10.11.0, session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually
  invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted
  but if the cookie value is captured, it will still work for the entire expiry time which is
  set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead
  of the stateful session token it was meant to be. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0.
