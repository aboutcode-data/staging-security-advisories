aliases: []
summary: The SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.3 via the use of file_exists()
  in the delete_entry_files() function without restriction on the path provided. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present
  in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin
  or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an
  additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform
  actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on
  the POP chain present.
