aliases: []
summary: "A flaw was found in Yggdrasil, which acts as a system broker, allowing the processes\
  \ to communicate to other children's \"worker\" processes through the DBus component. Yggdrasil\
  \ creates a DBus method to dispatch messages to workers. However, it misses authentication\
  \ and authorization checks, allowing every system user to call it. One available Yggdrasil\
  \ worker acts as a package manager with capabilities to create and enable new repositories\
  \ and install or remove packages. \n\nThis flaw allows an attacker with access to the system\
  \ to leverage the lack of authentication on the dispatch message to force the Yggdrasil worker\
  \ to install arbitrary RPM packages. This issue results in local privilege escalation, enabling\
  \ the attacker to access and modify sensitive system data."
