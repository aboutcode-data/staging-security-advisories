aliases: []
summary: In Apache Karaf prior to 4.2.0 release, if the sshd service in Karaf is left on so
  an administrator can manage the running instance, any user with rights to the Karaf console
  can pivot and read/write any file on the file system to which the Karaf process user has access.
  This can be locked down a bit by using chroot to change the root directory to protect files
  outside of the Karaf install directory; it can be further locked down by defining a security
  manager policy that limits file system access to those directories beneath the Karaf home
  that are necessary for the system to run. However, this still allows anyone with ssh access
  to the Karaf process to read and write a large number of files as the Karaf process user.
