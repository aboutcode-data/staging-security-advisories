summary: |
  Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted
  explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads
  or writes.

  Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or
  even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols
  involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only "named
  curves" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they
  specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent
  problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable
  application is low.

  In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates,
  so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509
  certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an "exotic"
  curve encoding.

  The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),
  and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.

  Applications working with "exotic" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters,
  that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero
  constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a
  result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.  Remote code execution
  cannot easily be ruled out.

  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
