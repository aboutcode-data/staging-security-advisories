  nvme-pci: handle changing device dma map requirements

  The initial state of dma_needs_unmap may be false, but change to true
  while mapping the data iterator. Enabling swiotlb is one such case that
  can change the result. The nvme driver needs to save the mapped dma
  vectors to be unmapped later, so allocate as needed during iteration
  rather than assume it was always allocated at the beginning. This fixes
  a NULL dereference from accessing an uninitialized dma_vecs when the
  device dma unmapping requirements change mid-iteration.
