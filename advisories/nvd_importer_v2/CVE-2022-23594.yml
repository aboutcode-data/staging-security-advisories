aliases: []
summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The TFG dialect of TensorFlow
  (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the
  MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these
  assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash
  in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These
  issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We
  will patch them as they are discovered.
