aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  tty: add the option to have a tty reject a new ldisc

  ... and use it to limit the virtual terminals to just N_TTY.  They are
  kind of special, and in particular, the "con_write()" routine violates
  the "writes cannot sleep" rule that some ldiscs rely on.

  This avoids the

     BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/printk/printk.c:2659

  when N_GSM has been attached to a virtual console, and gsmld_write()
  calls con_write() while holding a spinlock, and con_write() then tries
  to get the console lock.
