aliases: []
summary: 'libmemcached-awesome is an open source C/C++ client library and tools for the memcached
  server. `libmemcached` could return data for a previously requested key, if that previous
  request timed out due to a low `POLL_TIMEOUT`. This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.4.
  Users are advised to upgrade. There are several ways to workaround or lower the probability
  of this bug affecting a given deployment. 1: use a reasonably high `POLL_TIMEOUT` setting,
  like the default. 2: use separate libmemcached connections for unrelated data. 3: do not re-use
  libmemcached connections in an unknown state.'
