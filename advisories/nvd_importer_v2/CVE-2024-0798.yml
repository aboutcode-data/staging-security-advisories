aliases: []
summary: A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing
  users with 'default' role to delete documents uploaded by 'admin'. Despite the intended restriction
  that prevents 'default' role users from deleting admin-uploaded documents, an attacker can
  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DELETE request to the /api/system/remove-document
  endpoint. This vulnerability is due to improper access control checks, enabling unauthorized
  document deletion and potentially leading to loss of data integrity.
