summary: The The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the bulk_remove() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to arbitrary directory deletion in /wp-content via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
