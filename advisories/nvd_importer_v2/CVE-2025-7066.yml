summary: Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that
  for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done
  by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning
  with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio.
  However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing
  a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers
  see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker
  to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser
  preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.
