  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  dmaengine: stm32: dmamux: fix device leak on route allocation

  Make sure to drop the reference taken when looking up the DMA mux
  platform device during route allocation.

  Note that holding a reference to a device does not prevent its driver
  data from going away so there is no point in keeping the reference.
