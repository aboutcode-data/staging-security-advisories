aliases: []
summary: Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. Affected versions
  are subject to an arbitrary file write vulnerability in the backup restore feature which allows
  an authenticated attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE). Squidex allows users with the
  `squidex.admin.restore` permission to create and restore backups. Part of these backups are
  the assets uploaded to an App. For each asset, the backup zip archive contains a `.asset`
  file with the actual content of the asset as well as a related `AssetCreatedEventV2` event,
  which is stored in a JSON file. Amongst other things, the JSON file contains the event type
  (`AssetCreatedEventV2`), the ID of the asset (`46c05041-9588-4179-b5eb-ddfcd9463e1e`), its
  filename (`test.txt`), and its file version (`0`). When a backup with this event is restored,
  the `BackupAssets.ReadAssetAsync` method is responsible for re-creating the asset. For this
  purpose, it determines the name of the `.asset` file in the zip archive, reads its content,
  and stores the content in the filestore. When the asset is stored in the filestore via the
  UploadAsync method, the assetId and fileVersion are passed as arguments. These are further
  passed to the method GetFileName, which determines the filename where the asset should be
  stored. The assetId is inserted into the filename without any sanitization and an attacker
  with squidex.admin.restore privileges to run arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying
  server (RCE).
