aliases: []
summary: An issue in Raspberry Pi Imager version 1.9.6 for Windows, affecting its OS customization
  feature. The imager's 'public-key authentication' setting unintentionally re-adds a user's
  id_rsa.pub key from their local Windows machine to the authorized_keys file on the Raspberry
  Pi, even after the user explicitly deletes the key from the user interface. This creates an
  unintended attack surface, as it could allow an attacker to use a different key than the intended
  one to login to the device.
