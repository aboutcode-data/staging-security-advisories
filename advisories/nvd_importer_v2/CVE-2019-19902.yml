aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.13.x before 1.13.5 and 1.14.x before 1.14.2.
  It allows the upload of entire-site configuration archives through the user interface or command
  line. It does not sufficiently check uploaded archives for invalid data, allowing non-configuration
  scripts to potentially be uploaded to the server. This issue is mitigated by the fact that
  the attacker would be required to have the "Synchronize, import, and export configuration"
  permission, a permission that only trusted administrators should be given. Other measures
  in the product prevent the execution of PHP scripts, so another server-side scripting language
  must be accessible on the server to execute code.
