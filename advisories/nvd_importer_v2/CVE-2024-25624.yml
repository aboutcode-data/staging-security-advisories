aliases: []
summary: Iris is a web collaborative platform aiming to help incident responders sharing technical
  details during investigations. Due to an improper setup of Jinja2 environment, reports generation
  in `iris-web` is prone to a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI). Successful exploitation
  of the vulnerability can lead to an arbitrary Remote Code Execution. An authenticated administrator
  has to upload a crafted report template containing the payload. Upon generation of a report
  based on the weaponized report, any user can trigger the vulnerability.  The vulnerability
  is patched in IRIS v2.4.6. No workaround is available. It is recommended to update as soon
  as possible. Until patching, review the report templates and keep the administrative privileges
  that include the upload of report templates limited to dedicated users.
