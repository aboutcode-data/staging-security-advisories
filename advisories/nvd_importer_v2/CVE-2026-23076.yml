  ALSA: ctxfi: Fix potential OOB access in audio mixer handling

  In the audio mixer handling code of ctxfi driver, the conf field is
  used as a kind of loop index, and it's referred in the index callbacks
  (amixer_index() and sum_index()).

  As spotted recently by fuzzers, the current code causes OOB access at
  those functions.
  | UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in /build/reproducible-path/linux-6.17.8/sound/pci/ctxfi/ctamixer.c:347:48
  | index 8 is out of range for type 'unsigned char [8]'

  After the analysis, the cause was found to be the lack of the proper
  (re-)initialization of conj field.

  This patch addresses those OOB accesses by adding the proper
  initializations of the loop indices.
