aliases: []
summary: OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions
  3.1.8 and 3.2.5, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is sent multiple times to an OpenSIPS
  configuration that makes use of the `stream_process` function. This issue was discovered during
  coverage guided fuzzing of the function `codec_delete_except_re`. By abusing this vulnerability,
  an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that
  rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. This issue has been
  fixed in version 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.
