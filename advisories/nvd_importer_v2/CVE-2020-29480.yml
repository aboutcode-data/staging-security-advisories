aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Neither xenstore implementation does
  any permission checks when reporting a xenstore watch event. A guest administrator can watch
  the root xenstored node, which will cause notifications for every created, modified, and deleted
  key. A guest administrator can also use the special watches, which will cause a notification
  every time a domain is created and destroyed. Data may include: number, type, and domids of
  other VMs; existence and domids of driver domains; numbers of virtual interfaces, block devices,
  vcpus; existence of virtual framebuffers and their backend style (e.g., existence of VNC service);
  Xen VM UUIDs for other domains; timing information about domain creation and device setup;
  and some hints at the backend provisioning of VMs and their devices. The watch events do not
  contain values stored in xenstore, only key names. A guest administrator can observe non-sensitive
  domain and device lifecycle events relating to other guests. This information allows some
  insight into overall system configuration (including the number and general nature of other
  guests), and configuration of other guests (including the number and general nature of other
  guests'' devices). This information might be commercially interesting or might make other
  attacks easier. There is not believed to be exposure of sensitive data. Specifically, there
  is no exposure of VNC passwords, port numbers, pathnames in host and guest filesystems, cryptographic
  keys, or within-guest data.'
