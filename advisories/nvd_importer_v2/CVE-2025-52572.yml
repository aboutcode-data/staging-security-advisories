aliases: []
summary: 'Hikka, a Telegram userbot, has vulnerability affects all users on all versions of
  Hikka. Two scenarios are possible. 1. Web interface does not have an authenticated session:
  attacker can use his own Telegram account to gain RCE to the server by authorizing in the
  dangling web interface. 2. Web interface does have an authenticated session: due to insufficient
  warning in the authentication message, users were tempted to click "Allow" in the "Allow web
  application ops" menu. This gave an attacker access not only to remote code execution, but
  also to Telegram accounts of owners. Scenario number 2 is known to have been exploited in
  the wild. No known patches are available, but some workarounds are available. Use `--no-web`
  flag and do not start userbot without it; after authorizing in the web interface, close the
  port on the server and/or start the userbot with `--no-web` flag; and do not click "Allow"
  in your helper bot unless it is your explicit action that needs to be allowed.'
