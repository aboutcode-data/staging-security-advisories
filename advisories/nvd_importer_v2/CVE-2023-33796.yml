summary: 'A vulnerability in Netbox v3.5.1 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute queries
  against the GraphQL database, granting them access to sensitive data stored in the database.
  NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the reporter''s only query was for the schema of the
  API, which is public; queries for database objects would have been denied.'
