  erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression

  Currently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplace
  decompression, that was used to handle the cases that some pages of
  compressed data are actually not in-place I/O.

  However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the compressed
  data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and it
  explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:
    __________________________________________________________
   |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|

  Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps two
  individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.
  Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for
  short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem to
  completely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reported
  that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.
  After some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the new
  FSRM feature expose this issue with "rep movsb".

  Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace
  decompression for now.  Later, as an useful improvement, we could try
  to tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.
