aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms-webui application,
  specifically within the reinstall_binding functionality in lollms_core/lollms/server/endpoints/lollms_binding_infos.py
  of the latest version. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient path sanitization, allowing
  an attacker to exploit path traversal to navigate to arbitrary directories. By manipulating
  the binding_path to point to a controlled directory and uploading a malicious __init__.py
  file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
