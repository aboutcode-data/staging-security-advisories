aliases: []
summary: Ray is an AI compute engine. In versions 2.53.0 and below, thedashboard HTTP server
  blocks browser-origin POST/PUT but does not cover DELETE, and key DELETE endpoints are unauthenticated
  by default. If the dashboard/agent is reachable (e.g., --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0), a web page
  via DNS rebinding or same-network access can issue DELETE requests that shut down Serve or
  delete jobs without user interaction. This is a drive-by availability impact. The fix for
  this vulnerability is to update to Ray 2.54.0 or higher.
