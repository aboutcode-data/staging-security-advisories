aliases: []
summary: anuko timetracker is an open source time tracking system. Boolean-based blind SQL injection
  vulnerability existed in Time Tracker invoices.php in versions prior to 1.22.11.5781. This
  was happening because of a coding error after validating parameters in POST requests. There
  was no check for errors before adjusting invoice sorting order. Because of this, it was possible
  to craft a POST request with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue has been
  fixed in version 1.22.11.5781. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may insert
  an additional check for errors in a condition before calling `ttGroupHelper::getActiveInvoices()`
  in invoices.php.
