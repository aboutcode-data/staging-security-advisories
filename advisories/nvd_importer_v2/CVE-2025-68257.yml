  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  comedi: check device's attached status in compat ioctls

  Syzbot identified an issue [1] that crashes kernel, seemingly due to
  unexistent callback dev->get_valid_routes(). By all means, this should
  not occur as said callback must always be set to
  get_zero_valid_routes() in __comedi_device_postconfig().

  As the crash seems to appear exclusively in i386 kernels, at least,
  judging from [1] reports, the blame lies with compat versions
  of standard IOCTL handlers. Several of them are modified and
  do not use comedi_unlocked_ioctl(). While functionality of these
  ioctls essentially copy their original versions, they do not
  have required sanity check for device's attached status. This,
  in turn, leads to a possibility of calling select IOCTLs on a
  device that has not been properly setup, even via COMEDI_DEVCONFIG.

  Doing so on unconfigured devices means that several crucial steps
  are missed, for instance, specifying dev->get_valid_routes()
  callback.

  Fix this somewhat crudely by ensuring device's attached status before
  performing any ioctls, improving logic consistency between modern
  and compat functions.
