aliases: []
summary: NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be subject to a HTTP
  Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input
  from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious
  user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and "inject" those newlines
  into the returned HTTP response. This capability allows users to work around security headers
  and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The
  injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests, which
  can lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by
  adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type, ensuring that there's no whitespace incorrectly
  present in the HTTP headers provided by users. As the existing API surface is non-failable,
  all invalid characters are replaced by linear whitespace.
