datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3138
aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability was found in libX11. The security flaw occurs because the functions
  in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values provided for the Request, Event, or
  Error IDs are within the bounds of the arrays that those functions write to, using those IDs
  as array indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an Xserver adhering
  to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X servers provided by X.Org do. As the
  protocol only specifies a single byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by
  a malicious server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other portions
  of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of the Display structure itself,
  possibly causing the client to crash with this memory corruption.
