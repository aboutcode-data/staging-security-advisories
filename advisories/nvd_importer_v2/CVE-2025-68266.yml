  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bfs: Reconstruct file type when loading from disk

  syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when
  the S_IFMT bits of the 32bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted
  or when the 32bits "attributes" field loaded from disk are corrupted.

  A documentation says that BFS uses only lower 9 bits of the "mode" field.
  But I can't find an explicit explanation that the unused upper 23 bits
  (especially, the S_IFMT bits) are initialized with 0.

  Therefore, ignore the S_IFMT bits of the "mode" field loaded from disk.
  Also, verify that the value of the "attributes" field loaded from disk is
  either BFS_VREG or BFS_VDIR (because BFS supports only regular files and
  the root directory).
