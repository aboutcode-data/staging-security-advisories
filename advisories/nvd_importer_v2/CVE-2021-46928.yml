  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  parisc: Clear stale IIR value on instruction access rights trap

  When a trap 7 (Instruction access rights) occurs, this means the CPU
  couldn't execute an instruction due to missing execute permissions on
  the memory region.  In this case it seems the CPU didn't even fetched
  the instruction from memory and thus did not store it in the cr19 (IIR)
  register before calling the trap handler. So, the trap handler will find
  some random old stale value in cr19.

  This patch simply overwrites the stale IIR value with a constant magic
  "bad food" value (0xbaadf00d), in the hope people don't start to try to
  understand the various random IIR values in trap 7 dumps.
