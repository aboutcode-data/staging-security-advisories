aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in libnbd. A malicious actor could exploit this by convincing libnbd
  to open a specially crafted Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This vulnerability arises because
  non-standard hostnames starting with '-o' are incorrectly interpreted as arguments to the
  Secure Shell (SSH) process, rather than as hostnames. This could lead to arbitrary code execution
  with the privileges of the user running libnbd.
