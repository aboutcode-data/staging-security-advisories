datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7599
aliases: []
summary: All versions of com.gradle.plugin-publish before 0.11.0 are vulnerable to Insertion
  of Sensitive Information into Log File. When a plugin author publishes a Gradle plugin while
  running Gradle with the --info log level flag, the Gradle Logger logs an AWS pre-signed URL.
  If this build log is publicly visible (as it is in many popular public CI systems like TravisCI)
  this AWS pre-signed URL would allow a malicious actor to replace a recently uploaded plugin
  with their own.
