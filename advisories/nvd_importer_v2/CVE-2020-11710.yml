summary: 'An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port
  may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE
  is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate
  Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong''s docker-compose template, and not Kong''s docker
  image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway.
  As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through
  2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose
  without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users
  to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect
  Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This
  link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions
  for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions
  , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949)
  Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue)
  on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.'
