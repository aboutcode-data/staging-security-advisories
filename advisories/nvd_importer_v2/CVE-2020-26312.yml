aliases: []
summary: "Dotmesh is a git-like command-line interface for capturing, organizing and sharing\
  \ application states. In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in\
  \ an unpacking routine may \nenable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations\
  \ outside the\n designated target folder. The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against\
  \ creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to.\
  \ However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..`\
  \ falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results\
  \ in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory, contrary to the routine’s\
  \ goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program\
  \ running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally,\
  \ if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary\
  \ system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch\
  \ for this issue is available."
