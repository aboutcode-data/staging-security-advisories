  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ftrace: Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable

  A soft lockup was observed when loading amdgpu module.
  If a module has a lot of tracable functions, multiple calls
  to kallsyms_lookup can spend too much time in RCU critical
  section and with disabled preemption, causing kernel panic.
  This is the same issue that was fixed in
  commit d0b24b4e91fc ("ftrace: Prevent RCU stall on PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY
  kernels") and commit 42ea22e754ba ("ftrace: Add cond_resched() to
  ftrace_graph_set_hash()").

  Fix it the same way by adding cond_resched() in ftrace_module_enable.
