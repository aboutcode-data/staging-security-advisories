  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  loop: Avoid updating block size under exclusive owner

  Syzbot came up with a reproducer where a loop device block size is
  changed underneath a mounted filesystem. This causes a mismatch between
  the block device block size and the block size stored in the superblock
  causing confusion in various places such as fs/buffer.c. The particular
  issue triggered by syzbot was a warning in __getblk_slow() due to
  requested buffer size not matching block device block size.

  Fix the problem by getting exclusive hold of the loop device to change
  its block size. This fails if somebody (such as filesystem) has already
  an exclusive ownership of the block device and thus prevents modifying
  the loop device under some exclusive owner which doesn't expect it.
