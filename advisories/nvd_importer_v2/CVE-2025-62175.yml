aliases: []
summary: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. In versions
  before 4.4.6, 4.3.14, and 4.2.27, disabling or suspending a user account does not disconnect
  the account from the streaming API. This allows disabled or suspended accounts to continue
  receiving real-time updates through existing streaming connections and to establish new streaming
  connections, even though they cannot interact with other API endpoints. This undermines moderation
  actions, as administrators expect disabled or suspended accounts to be fully disconnected
  from the service. This issue has been patched in versions 4.4.6, 4.3.14, and 4.2.27. No known
  workarounds exist.
