aliases: []
summary: The Customer Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.5. This is due to the presence
  of a shortcode that will generate a confirmation link with a placeholder email. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to generate
  a verification link for any unverified user and log into the account. The 'Fine tune placement'
  option must be enabled in the plugin settings in order to exploit the vulnerability.
