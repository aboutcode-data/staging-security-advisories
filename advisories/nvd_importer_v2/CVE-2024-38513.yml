aliases: []
summary: 'Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go A vulnerability present in
  versions prior to 2.52.5 is a session middleware issue in GoFiber versions 2 and above. This
  vulnerability allows users to supply their own session_id value, resulting in the creation
  of a session with that key. If a website relies on the mere presence of a session for security
  purposes, this can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and session
  fixation attacks. All users utilizing GoFiber''s session middleware in the affected versions
  are impacted. The issue has been addressed in version 2.52.5. Users are strongly encouraged
  to upgrade to version 2.52.5 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability. Users who are unable
  to upgrade immediately can apply the following workarounds to reduce the risk: Either implement
  additional validation to ensure session IDs are not supplied by the user and are securely
  generated by the server, or regularly rotate session IDs and enforce strict session expiration
  policies.'
