aliases: []
summary: '@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default Backstage software
  templates. Prior to version 2.1.1, duplicate logging of the input values in the fetch:template
  action in the Scaffolder meant that some of the secrets were not properly redacted. If ${{
  secrets.x }} is not passed through to fetch:template there is no impact. This issue has been
  resolved in 2.1.1 of the scaffolder-backend plugin. A workaround for this issue involves Template
  Authors removing the use of ${{ secrets }} being used as an argument to fetch:template.'
