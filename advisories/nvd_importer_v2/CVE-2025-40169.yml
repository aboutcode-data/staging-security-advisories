  bpf: Reject negative offsets for ALU ops

  When verifying BPF programs, the check_alu_op() function validates
  instructions with ALU operations. The 'offset' field in these
  instructions is a signed 16-bit integer.

  The existing check 'insn->off > 1' was intended to ensure the offset is
  either 0, or 1 for BPF_MOD/BPF_DIV. However, because 'insn->off' is
  signed, this check incorrectly accepts all negative values (e.g., -1).

  This commit tightens the validation by changing the condition to
  '(insn->off != 0 && insn->off != 1)'. This ensures that any value
  other than the explicitly permitted 0 and 1 is rejected, hardening the
  verifier against malformed BPF programs.
