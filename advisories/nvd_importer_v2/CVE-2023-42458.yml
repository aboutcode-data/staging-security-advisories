aliases: []
summary: Zope is an open-source web application server. Prior to versions 4.8.10 and 5.8.5,
  there is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images. Note that an image tag
  with an SVG image as source is never vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious
  code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload an image, and then
  trick a user into following a specially crafted link. Patches are available in Zope 4.8.10
  and 5.8.5. As a workaround, make sure the "Add Documents, Images, and Files" permission is
  only assigned to trusted roles. By default, only the Manager has this permission.
