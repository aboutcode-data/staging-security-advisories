aliases: []
summary: The macOS Rocket.Chat application is affected by a vulnerability that allows bypassing  Transparency,
  Consent, and Control (TCC) policies, enabling the exploitation or abuse of permissions specified
  in its entitlements (e.g., microphone, camera, automation, network client). Since Rocket.Chat
  was not signed with the Hardened Runtime nor set to enforce Library Validation, it is vulnerable
  to DYLIB injection attacks, which can lead to unauthorized actions or escalation of permissions.
  Consequently, an attacker gains capabilities that are not permitted by default under the Sandbox
  and its application profile.
