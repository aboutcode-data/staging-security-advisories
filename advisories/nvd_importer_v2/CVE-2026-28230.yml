aliases: []
summary: SteVe is an open-source EV charging station management system. In versions up to and
  including 3.11.0, when a charger sends a StopTransaction message, SteVe looks up the transaction
  solely by transactionId (a sequential integer starting from 1) without verifying that the
  requesting charger matches the charger that originally started the transaction. Any authenticated
  charger can terminate any other charger’s active session across the entire network. The root
  cause is in OcppServerRepositoryImpl.getTransaction() which queries only by transactionId
  with no chargeBoxId ownership check. The validator checks that the transaction exists and
  is not already stopped but never verifies identity. As an attacker controlling a single registered
  charger I could enumerate sequential transaction IDs and send StopTransaction messages targeting
  active sessions on every other charger on the network simultaneously. Combined with FINDING-014
  (unauthenticated SOAP endpoints), no registered charger is even required — the attack is executable
  with a single curl command requiring only a known chargeBoxId. Commit 7f169c6c5b36a9c458ec41ce8af581972e5c724e
  contains a fix for the issue.
