aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: hisilicon/qm - set NULL to qm->debug.qm_diff_regs

  When the initialization of qm->debug.acc_diff_reg fails,
  the probe process does not exit. However, after qm->debug.qm_diff_regs is
  freed, it is not set to NULL. This can lead to a double free when the
  remove process attempts to free it again. Therefore, qm->debug.qm_diff_regs
  should be set to NULL after it is freed.
