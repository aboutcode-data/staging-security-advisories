aliases: []
summary: 'Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3,
  there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the
  `/<camera_name>` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this
  vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user''s
  Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially
  crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker
  under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication);
  attacker knows the address of a user''s Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page
  which links to the user''s Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated
  user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included
  in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads.
  Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue.'
