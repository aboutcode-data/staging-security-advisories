aliases: []
summary: vulnerability-lookup 2.16.0 allows XSS in bundle.py, comment.py, and user.py, by a
  user on a vulnerability-lookup instance who can add bundles, comments, or sightings. A cross-site
  scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the handling of user-supplied input in the
  Bundles, Comments, and Sightings components. Untrusted data was not properly sanitized before
  being rendered in templates and tables, which could allow attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript
  into the application. The issue was due to unsafe use of innerHTML and insufficient validation
  of dynamic URLs and model fields. This vulnerability has been fixed by escaping untrusted
  data, replacing innerHTML assignments with safer DOM methods, encoding URLs with encodeURIComponent,
  and improving input validation in the affected models.
