summary: The Posts Navigation Links for Sections and Headings – Free by WP Masters plugin for
  WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
  1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wpm_navigation_links_settings'
  page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
