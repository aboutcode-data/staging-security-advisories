aliases: []
summary: 'Elide is a Java library that lets you stand up a GraphQL/JSON-API web service with
  minimal effort. When leveraging the following together: Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic
  Queries, Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter), and a
  parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully
  crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection. A
  recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the ''-'' character to be included in parameterized TEXT
  columns. This character can be interpreted as SQL comments (''--'') and allow the attacker
  to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters. A fix
  is provided in Elide 6.1.4. The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type
  TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds include leveraging
  a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized
  columns.'
