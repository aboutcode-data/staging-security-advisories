aliases: []
summary: 'Guidance Software EnCase does not properly handle (1) certain malformed MBR partition
  tables with many entries, which allows remote attackers to prevent logical collection of a
  disk image; (2) NTFS filesystems with directory loops, which allows remote attackers to prevent
  examination of certain directory contents; and (3) certain other malformed NTFS filesystems,
  which allows remote attackers to prevent examination of corrupted records. NOTE: the vendor
  disputes the significance of these issues, because physical collection can be used instead,
  because the vendor believes that relevant attackers typically do not corrupt an MBR or a filesystem,
  and because detection of a loop is valuable on its own'
