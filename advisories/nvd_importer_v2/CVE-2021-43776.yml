aliases: []
summary: Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. In affected versions
  the auth-backend plugin allows a malicious actor to trick another user into visiting a vulnerable
  URL that executes an XSS attack. This attack can potentially allow the attacker to exfiltrate
  access tokens or other secrets from the user's browser. The default CSP does prevent this
  attack, but it is expected that some deployments have these policies disabled due to incompatibilities.
  This is vulnerability is patched in version `0.4.9` of `@backstage/plugin-auth-backend`.
