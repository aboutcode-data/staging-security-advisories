aliases: []
summary: 'OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to 2026.2.14, browser-facing localhost
  mutation routes accepted cross-origin browser requests without explicit Origin/Referer validation.
  Loopback binding reduces remote exposure but does not prevent browser-initiated requests from
  malicious origins. A malicious website can trigger unauthorized state changes against a victim''s
  local OpenClaw browser control plane (for example opening tabs, starting/stopping the browser,
  mutating storage/cookies) if the browser control service is reachable on loopback in the victim''s
  browser context. Starting in version 2026.2.14, mutating HTTP methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)
  are rejected when the request indicates a non-loopback Origin/Referer (or `Sec-Fetch-Site:
  cross-site`). Other mitigations include enabling browser control auth (token/password) and
  avoid running with auth disabled.'
