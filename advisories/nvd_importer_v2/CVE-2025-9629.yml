aliases: []
summary: The USS Upyun plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the uss_setting_page function when processing the uss_set form type. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to modify critical Upyun cloud storage settings including bucket
  name, operator credentials, upload paths, and image processing parameters via a forged request
  granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on
  a link.
