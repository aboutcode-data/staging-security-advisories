summary: The Peter’s Custom Anti-Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to missing nonce validation
  on the cas_register_post() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to blacklist emails via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
