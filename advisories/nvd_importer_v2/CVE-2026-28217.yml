aliases: []
summary: hoppscotch is an open source API development ecosystem. Prior to version 2026.2.0,
  the `userCollection` GraphQL query accepts an arbitrary collection ID and returns the full
  collection data — including title, type, and the serialized `data` field containing HTTP requests
  with headers and potentially secrets — to any authenticated user, without verifying that the
  requesting user owns the collection. This is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) caused
  by a missing authorization check that exists on every other operation in the same resolver.
  Version 2026.2.0 fixes the issue.
