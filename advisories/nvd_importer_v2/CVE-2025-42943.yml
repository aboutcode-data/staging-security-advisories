aliases: []
summary: SAP GUI for Windows may allow the leak of NTML hashes when specific ABAP frontend services
  are called with UNC paths. For a successful attack, the attacker needs developer authorization
  in a specific Application Server ABAP to make changes in the code, and the victim needs to
  execute by using SAP GUI for Windows. This could trigger automatic NTLM authentication, potentially
  exposing hashed credentials to an attacker. As a result, it has a high impact on the confidentiality.
