summary: The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.68.10. This is due to a lack of restriction on the directory
  an administrator can select for storing downloads. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to download and read any file on the
  server, including system and configuration files.
