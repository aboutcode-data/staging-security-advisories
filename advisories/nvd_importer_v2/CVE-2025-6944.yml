aliases: []
summary: The Uncode Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via
  the plugin's 'uncode_hl_text' and 'uncode_text_icon' shortcodes in all versions up to, and
  including, 2.9.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied
  attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access
  and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses
  an injected page.
