summary: 'MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Scratch scratch-vm before 0.2.0-prerelease.20200714185213
  loads extension URLs from untrusted project.json files with certain _ characters, resulting
  in remote code execution because the URL''s content is treated as a script and is executed
  as a worker. The responsible code is getExtensionIdForOpcode in serialization/sb3.js. The
  use of _ is incompatible with a protection mechanism in older versions, in which URLs were
  split and consequently deserialization attacks were prevented. NOTE: the scratch.mit.edu hosted
  service is not affected because of the lack of worker scripts.'
