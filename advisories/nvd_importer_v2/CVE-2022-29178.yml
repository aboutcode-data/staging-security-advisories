aliases: []
summary: Cilium is open source software for providing and securing network connectivity and
  loadbalancing between application workloads. Cilium prior to versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and
  1.11.15 contains an incorrect default permissions vulnerability. Operating Systems with users
  belonging to the group ID 1000 can access the API of Cilium via Unix domain socket available
  on the host where Cilium is running. This could allow malicious users to compromise integrity
  as well as system availability on that host. The problem has been fixed and the patch is available
  in versions 1.9.16, 1.10.11, and 1.11.5. A potential workaround is to modify Cilium's DaemonSet
  to run with a certain command, which can be found in the GitHub Security Advisory for this
  vulnerability.
