aliases: []
summary: Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by cache lifecycle inconsistency in
  the EVM module. Due to the inconsistency between the Storage caching cycle and the Tx processing
  cycle, Storage changes caused by a failed transaction are improperly reserved in memory. Although
  the bad storage cache data will be discarded at EndBlock, it is still valid in the current
  block, which enables many possible attacks such as an "arbitrary mint token".
