aliases: []
summary: The AR for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized double extension
  file upload due to a missing capability check on the set_ar_featured_image() function in all
  versions up to, and including, 7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  upload php files leveraging a double extension attack. It's important to note the file is
  deleted immediately and double extension attacks only work on select servers making this unlikely
  to be successfully exploited.
