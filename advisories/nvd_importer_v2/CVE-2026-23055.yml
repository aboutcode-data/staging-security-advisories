  The warning is triggered because I2C transfers can still be attempted
  while the controller is already suspended, due to inappropriate ordering
  of the system sleep callbacks.

  If the controller is autosuspended, there is no way to wake it up once
  runtime PM disabled (in suspend_late()). During system resume, the I2C
  controller will be available only after runtime PM is re-enabled
  (in resume_early()). However, this may be too late for some devices.

  Wake up the controller in the suspend() callback while runtime PM is
  still enabled. The I2C controller will remain available until the
  suspend_noirq() callback (pm_runtime_force_suspend()) is called. During
  resume, the I2C controller can be restored by the resume_noirq() callback
  (pm_runtime_force_resume()). Finally, the resume() callback re-enables
  autosuspend. As a result, the I2C controller can remain available until
  the system enters suspend_noirq() and from resume_noirq().
