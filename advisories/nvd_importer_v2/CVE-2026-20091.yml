summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco\
  \ UCS Manager Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site\
  \ scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due\
  \ to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface\
  \ of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious\
  \ data into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,\
  \ browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability,&nbsp;the attacker must have valid\
  \ credentials for a user account with the role of Administrator or AAA Administrator.&nbsp;"
