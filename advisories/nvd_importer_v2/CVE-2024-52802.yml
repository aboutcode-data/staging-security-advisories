aliases: []
summary: RIOT is an operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In version 2024.04
  and prior, the function `_parse_advertise`, located in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`,
  has no minimum header length check for `dhcpv6_opt_t` after processing `dhcpv6_msg_t`. This
  omission could lead to an out-of-bound read, causing system inconsistency. Additionally, the
  same lack of a header length check is present in the function `_preparse_advertise`, which
  is called by `_parse_advertise` before handling the request. As of time of publication, no
  known patched version exists.
