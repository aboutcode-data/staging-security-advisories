aliases: []
summary: The WP AUDIO GALLERY plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthorized Arbitrary File
  Read in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to insufficient capability checks
  and lack of nonce verification on the "wpag_htaccess_callback" function This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the site's
  .htaccess file with arbitrary content, which can lead to arbitrary file read on the server
  under certain configurations.
