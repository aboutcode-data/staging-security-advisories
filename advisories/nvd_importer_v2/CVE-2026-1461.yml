aliases: []
summary: The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Handling of Missing
  Values in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.0 via the Stripe webhook handler. This is
  due to the plugin only validating webhook signatures when the stripe-webhook-signing-secret
  setting is configured, which is empty by default. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to forge Stripe webhook events to manipulate membership subscriptions, including
  reactivating expired memberships without payment or canceling legitimate subscriptions, potentially
  leading to unauthorized access and service disruption.
