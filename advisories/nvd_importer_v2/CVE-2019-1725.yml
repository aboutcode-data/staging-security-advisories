aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the local management CLI implementation for specific commands on
  the Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Servers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite
  an arbitrary file on disk. It is also possible the attacker could inject CLI command parameters
  that should not be allowed for a specific subset of local management CLI commands. The vulnerability
  is due to lack of proper input validation of user input for local management CLI commands.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a
  crafted form of a limited subset of local management CLI commands. An exploit could allow
  the attacker to overwrite an arbitrary files on disk or inject CLI command parameters that
  should have been disabled. This vulnerability is fixed in software version 4.0(2a) and later.
