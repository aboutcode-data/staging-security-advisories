summary: The Social Login Lite For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication
  bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.6.0. This is due to insufficient verification on
  the user being supplied during the social login through the plugin. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator,
  if they have access to the email.
