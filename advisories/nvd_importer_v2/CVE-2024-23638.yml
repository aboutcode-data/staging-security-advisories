aliases: []
summary: 'Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired pointer reference bug, Squid
  prior to version 6.6 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Cache Manager error
  responses. This problem allows a trusted client to perform Denial of Service when generating
  error pages for Client Manager reports. Squid older than 5.0.5 have not been tested and should
  be assumed to be vulnerable. All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 are vulnerable. All Squid-6.x
  up to and including 6.5 are vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition,
  patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid''s patch archives.
  As a workaround, prevent access to Cache Manager using Squid''s main access control: `http_access
  deny manager`.'
