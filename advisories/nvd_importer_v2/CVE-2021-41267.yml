summary: Symfony/Http-Kernel is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP framework for web
  and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Headers that are not part of
  the "trusted_headers" allowed list are ignored and protect users from "Cache poisoning" attacks.
  In Symfony 5.2, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` headers, but this header
  was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was not part of the "trusted_headers" allowed list.
  An attacker could leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-Prefix`
  header, leading to a web cache poisoning issue. Versions 5.3.12 and later have a patch to
  ensure that the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is not forwarded to subrequests when it is not
  trusted.
