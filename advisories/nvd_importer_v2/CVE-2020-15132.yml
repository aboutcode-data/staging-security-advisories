aliases: []
summary: In Sulu before versions 1.6.35, 2.0.10, and 2.1.1, when the "Forget password" feature
  on the login screen is used, Sulu asks the user for a username or email address. If the given
  string is not found, a response with a `400` error code is returned, along with a error message
  saying that this user name does not exist. This enables attackers to retrieve valid usernames.
  Also, the response of the "Forgot Password" request returns the email address to which the
  email was sent, if the operation was successful. This information should not be exposed, as
  it can be used to gather email addresses. This problem was fixed in versions 1.6.35, 2.0.10
  and 2.1.1.
