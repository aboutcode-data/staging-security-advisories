aliases: []
summary: Cachi2 is a command-line interface tool that pre-fetches a project's dependencies to
  aid in making the project's build process network-isolated. Prior to version 0.14.0, secrets
  may be shown in logs when an unhandled exception is triggered because the tool is logging
  locals of each function. This may uncover secrets if tool used in CI/build pipelines as it's
  the main use case. Version 0.14.0 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are
  available.
