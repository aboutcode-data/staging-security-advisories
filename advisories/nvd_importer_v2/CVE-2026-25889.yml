aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to 2.57.1, a case-sensitivity
  flaw in the password validation logic allows any authenticated user to change their password
  (or an admin to change any user's password) without providing the current password. By using
  Title Case field name "Password" instead of lowercase "password" in the API request, the current_password
  verification is completely bypassed. This enables account takeover if an attacker obtains
  a valid JWT token through XSS, session hijacking, or other means. This vulnerability is fixed
  in 2.57.1.
