aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  HID: mcp-2221: prevent UAF in delayed work

  If the device is plugged/unplugged without giving time for mcp_init_work()
  to complete, we might kick in the devm free code path and thus have
  unavailable struct mcp_2221 while in delayed work.

  Canceling the delayed_work item is enough to solve the issue, because
  cancel_delayed_work_sync will prevent the work item to requeue itself.
