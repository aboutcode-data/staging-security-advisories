summary: The Everest Backup – WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore & Cloning Plugin plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the

  possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the back-up progress files and cause a back-up
  to fail while it is in progress.
