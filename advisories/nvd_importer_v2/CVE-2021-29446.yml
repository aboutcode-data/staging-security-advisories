aliases: []
summary: jose-node-cjs-runtime is an npm package which provides a number of cryptographic functions.
  In versions prior to 3.11.4 the AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithm (A128CBC-HS256, A192CBC-HS384,
  A256CBC-HS512) decryption would always execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption,
  if either failed `JWEDecryptionFailed` would be thrown. But a possibly observable difference
  in timing when padding error would occur while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle
  and an adversary might be able to make use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing
  the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the
  number of bytes in the ciphertext block). A patch was released which ensures the HMAC tag
  is verified before performing CBC decryption. The fixed versions are `>=3.11.4`. Users should
  upgrade to `^3.11.4`.
