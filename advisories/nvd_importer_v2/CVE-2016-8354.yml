summary: An issue was discovered in Schneider Electric Unity PRO prior to V11.1. Unity projects
  can be compiled as x86 instructions and loaded onto the PLC Simulator delivered with Unity

  crafted patched Unity project file can make the simulator execute malicious code by redirecting
  the control flow of these instructions.
