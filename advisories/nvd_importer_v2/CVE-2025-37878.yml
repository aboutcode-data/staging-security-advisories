  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  perf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init

  Move the get_ctx(child_ctx) call and the child_event->ctx assignment to
  occur immediately after the child event is allocated. Ensure that
  child_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within
  inherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the
  cleanup code.

  Details:

  There's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of
  multiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not
  a single regression.

  The code initially incremented refcount then assigned context
  immediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early
  validity check for child_event was added before the
  refcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was
  added, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.
  The problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial
  check passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its
  precondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after
  its initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any
  subsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().

  To resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment
  directly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the
  parent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on
  event->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is
  non-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing
  in child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.
