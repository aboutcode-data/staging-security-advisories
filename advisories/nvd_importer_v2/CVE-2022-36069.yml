aliases: []
summary: Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from
  a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`.
  These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the
  commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of
  arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input
  starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional
  one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be
  leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal
  credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could
  use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair
  amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However,
  it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is
  safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen,
  e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory. Versions
  1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.
