aliases: []
summary: matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions
  prior to 19.4.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or
  impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability
  to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but
  be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer. This issue has been fixed
  in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate
  this issue by redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and
  restarting the client. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage
  will often fix most perceived issues. In some cases, no workarounds are possible.
