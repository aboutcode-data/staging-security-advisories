aliases: []
summary: The CleverControl employee monitoring software (v11.5.1041.6) fails to validate TLS
  server certificates during the installation process. The installer downloads and executes
  external components using curl.exe --insecure, enabling a man-in-the-middle attacker to deliver
  malicious files that are executed with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to full remote code
  execution with administrative rights. No patch is available as the vendor has been unresponsive.
  It is assumed that previous versions are also affected, but this is not confirmed.
