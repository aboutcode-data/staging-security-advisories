aliases: []
summary: The Ninja Forms Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Self-Based
  Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Referer' header in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.15
  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick
  a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation of this
  vulnerability requires "maintenance mode" for a targeted form to be enabled. However, there
  is no setting available to the attacker or even an administrator-level user to enable this
  mode. The mode is only enabled during a required update, which is a very short window of time.
  Additionally, because of the self-based nature of this vulnerability, attackers would have
  to rely on additional techniques to execute a supplied payload in the context of targeted
  user.
