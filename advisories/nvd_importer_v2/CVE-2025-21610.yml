aliases: []
summary: Trix is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get rich text editor for everyday writing. Versions
  prior to 2.1.12 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when pasting malicious code in the
  link field. An attacker could trick the user to copy&paste a malicious `javascript:` URL as
  a link that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session,
  potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being
  disclosed. Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.12 or later to receive a patch.
  In addition to upgrading, affected users can disallow browsers that don't support a Content
  Security Policy (CSP) as a workaround for this and other cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
  Set CSP policies such as script-src 'self' to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same
  origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using script-src-elem.
