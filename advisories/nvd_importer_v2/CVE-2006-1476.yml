aliases: []
summary: Windows Firewall in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 produces incorrect application block alerts
  when the application filename is ".exe" (with no characters before the "."), which might allow
  local user-assisted users to trick a user into unblocking a Trojan horse program, as demonstrated
  by a malicious ".exe" program in a folder named "Internet Explorer," which triggers a question
  about whether to unblock the "Internet Explorer" program.
