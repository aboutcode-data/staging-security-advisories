aliases: []
summary: MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. In versions
  up to and including 1.5.0, in `model_dict = torch.load(full_path, map_location=torch.device(device),
  weights_only=True)` in monai/bundle/scripts.py , `weights_only=True` is loaded securely. However,
  insecure loading methods still exist elsewhere in the project, such as when loading checkpoints.
  This is a common practice when users want to reduce training time and costs by loading pre-trained
  models downloaded from other platforms. Loading a checkpoint containing malicious content
  can trigger a deserialization vulnerability, leading to code execution. As of time of publication,
  no known fixed versions are available.
