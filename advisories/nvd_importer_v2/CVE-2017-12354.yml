aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS)
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information on an affected
  system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently protect
  system software version information when the software responds to HTTP requests that are sent
  to the web-based interface of the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
  sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based interface of the affected software. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information about the software, which the
  attacker could use to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf66155.'
