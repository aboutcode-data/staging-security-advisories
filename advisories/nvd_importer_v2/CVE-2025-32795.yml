summary: Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability
  was identified in the DIFY where normal users are improperly granted permissions to edit APP
  names, descriptions and icons. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to modify app
  details, despite being restricted from viewing apps, which poses a security risk to the integrity
  of the application. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability
  involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions
  and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges
  can modify app details.
