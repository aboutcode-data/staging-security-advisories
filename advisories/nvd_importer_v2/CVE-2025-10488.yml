summary: 'The Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listings
  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file move due to insufficient file path validation
  in the add_listing_action AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.4.8. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can
  easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).'
