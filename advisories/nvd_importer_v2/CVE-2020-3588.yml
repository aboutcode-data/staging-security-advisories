summary: 'A vulnerability in virtualization channel messaging in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop
  App for Windows could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.
  This vulnerability occurs when this app is deployed in a virtual desktop environment and using
  virtual environment optimization. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of messages
  processed by the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App. A local attacker with limited privileges
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious messages to the affected software by
  using the virtualization channel interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to modify the underlying operating system configuration, which could allow the attacker to
  execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a targeted user. Note: This vulnerability can
  be exploited only when Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App is in a virtual desktop environment
  on a hosted virtual desktop (HVD) and is configured to use the Cisco Webex Meetings virtual
  desktop plug-in for thin clients.'
