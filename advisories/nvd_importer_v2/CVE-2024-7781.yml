aliases: []
summary: The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all
  versions up to, and including, 4.7.5. This is due to improper authentication via the Social
  Login widget. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first
  user to have logged in with a social media account, including administrator accounts. Attackers
  can exploit the vulnerability even if the Social Login element has been disabled, as long
  as it was previously enabled and used. The vulnerability was partially patched in version
  4.7.5, and fully patched in version 4.7.8.
