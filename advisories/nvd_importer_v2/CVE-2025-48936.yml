aliases: []
summary: Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to versions 2.70.12,
  2.71.10, and 3.2.2, a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL
  utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the
  URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then
  emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection),
  they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain
  controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret
  reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then
  be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific
  attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless
  authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2.
