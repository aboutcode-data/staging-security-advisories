aliases: []
summary: File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it
  can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. The file access permissions
  for files uploaded to or created from File Browser are never explicitly set by the application.
  The same is true for the database used by File Browser. On standard servers using File Browser
  prior to version 2.33.7 where the umask configuration has not been hardened before, this makes
  all the stated files readable by any operating system account. Version 2.33.7 fixes the issue.
