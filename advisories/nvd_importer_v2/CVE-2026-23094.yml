  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  uacce: fix isolate sysfs check condition

  uacce supports the device isolation feature. If the driver
  implements the isolate_err_threshold_read and
  isolate_err_threshold_write callback functions, uacce will create
  sysfs files now. Users can read and configure the isolation policy
  through sysfs. Currently, sysfs files are created as long as either
  isolate_err_threshold_read or isolate_err_threshold_write callback
  functions are present.

  However, accessing a non-existent callback function may cause the
  system to crash. Therefore, intercept the creation of sysfs if
  neither read nor write exists; create sysfs if either is supported,
  but intercept unsupported operations at the call site.
