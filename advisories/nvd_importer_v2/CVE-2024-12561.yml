summary: The Affiliate Sales in Google Analytics and other tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9. This is due to insufficient
  validation on the redirect url supplied via the 'afflink' parameter. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can
  successfully trick them into performing an action.
