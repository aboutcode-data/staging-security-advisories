summary: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications
  built on top of it. Any user who can view `Invitation.WebHome` can execute arbitrary script
  macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted

  15.2-rc-1, and 14.10.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually
  apply the patch on `Invitation.InvitationCommon` and `Invitation.InvitationConfig`, but there
  are otherwise no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
