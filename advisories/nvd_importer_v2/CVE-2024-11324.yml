summary: The Accounting for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site
  Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions

  arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing
  an action such as clicking on a link.
