  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  bpf: prevent leak of lsm program after failed attach

  In [0], we added the ability to bpf_prog_attach LSM programs to cgroups,
  but in our validation to make sure the prog is meant to be attached to
  BPF_LSM_CGROUP, we return too early if the check fails. This results in
  lack of decrementing prog's refcnt (through bpf_prog_put)
  leaving the LSM program alive past the point of the expected lifecycle.
  This fix allows for the decrement to take place.
