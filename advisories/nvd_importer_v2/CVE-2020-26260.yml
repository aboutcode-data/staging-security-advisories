aliases: []
summary: BookStack is a platform for storing and organising information and documentation. In
  BookStack before version 0.30.5, a user with permissions to edit a page could set certain
  image URL's to manipulate functionality in the exporting system, which would allow them to
  make server side requests and/or have access to a wider scope of files within the BookStack
  file storage locations. The issue was addressed in BookStack v0.30.5. As a workaround, page
  edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade.
