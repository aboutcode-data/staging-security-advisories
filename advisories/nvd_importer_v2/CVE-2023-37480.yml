summary: Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data privacy requests
  and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service
  (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit a weakness in the connector template upload feature to
  upload a malicious zip bomb file, resulting in resource exhaustion and service unavailability
  for all users of the Fides webserver. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through
  `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER`
  scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been
  patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to
  secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability
  without upgrading. If an attack occurs, the impact can be mitigated by manually or automatically
  restarting the affected container.
