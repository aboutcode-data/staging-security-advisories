aliases: []
summary: The Buddypress Force Password Change plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated
  account takeover due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating
  their password through the 'bp_force_password_ajax' function in all versions up to, and including,
  0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and
  above and under certain prerequisites, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators,
  and leverage that to gain access to their accounts.
