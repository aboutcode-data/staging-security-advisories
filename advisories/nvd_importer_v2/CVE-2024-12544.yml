aliases: []
summary: 'The SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple
  forms of any complexity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due
  to a missing capability check on the callback function of the SurveyJS_DeleteFile class in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.12.17. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can
  easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
  This function is still vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery as of 1.12.20.'
