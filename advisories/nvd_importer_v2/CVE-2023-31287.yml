aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Serenity Serene (and StartSharp) before 6.7.0. Password
  reset links are sent by email. A link contains a token that is used to reset the password.
  This token remains valid even after the password reset and can be used a second time to change
  the password of the corresponding user. The token expires only 3 hours after issuance and
  is sent as a query parameter when resetting. An attacker with access to the browser history
  can thus use the token again to change the password in order to take over the account.
