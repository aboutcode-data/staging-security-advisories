aliases: []
summary: lestrrat-go/jwx is a Go module implementing various JWx (JWA/JWE/JWK/JWS/JWT, otherwise
  known as JOSE) technologies. A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could
  lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE
  Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations
  needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the
  key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource-
  intensive. Therefore, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number,
  it can cause a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability
  has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version 1.2.27
  and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
