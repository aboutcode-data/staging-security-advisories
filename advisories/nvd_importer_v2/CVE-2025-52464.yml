aliases: []
summary: Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. In versions from 2.5.0 to before
  2.6.11, the flashing procedure of several hardware vendors was resulting in duplicated public/private
  keys. Additionally, the Meshtastic was failing to properly initialize the internal randomness
  pool on some platforms, leading to possible low-entropy key generation. When users with an
  affected key pair sent Direct Messages, those message could be captured and decrypted by an
  attacker that has compiled the list of compromised keys. This issue has been patched in version
  2.6.11 where key generation is delayed til the first time the LoRa region is set, along with
  warning users when a compromised key is detected. Version 2.6.12 furthers this patch by automatically
  wiping known compromised keys when found. A workaround to this vulnerability involves users
  doing a complete device wipe to remove vendor-cloned keys.
