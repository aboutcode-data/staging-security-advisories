aliases: []
summary: Drupal 9.3 implemented a generic entity access API for entity revisions. However, this
  API was not completely integrated with existing permissions, resulting in some possible access
  bypass for users who have access to use revisions of content generally, but who do not have
  access to individual items of node and media content. This vulnerability only affects sites
  using Drupal's revision system.
