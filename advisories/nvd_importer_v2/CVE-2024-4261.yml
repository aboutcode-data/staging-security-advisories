aliases: []
summary: The Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1. This
  is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate
  a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
  subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
