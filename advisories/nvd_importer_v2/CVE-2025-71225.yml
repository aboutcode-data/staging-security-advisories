  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md: suspend array while updating raid_disks via sysfs

  In raid1_reshape(), freeze_array() is called before modifying the r1bio
  memory pool (conf->r1bio_pool) and conf->raid_disks, and
  unfreeze_array() is called after the update is completed.

  However, freeze_array() only waits until nr_sync_pending and
  (nr_pending - nr_queued) of all buckets reaches zero. When an I/O error
  occurs, nr_queued is increased and the corresponding r1bio is queued to
  either retry_list or bio_end_io_list. As a result, freeze_array() may
  unblock before these r1bios are released.

  This can lead to a situation where conf->raid_disks and the mempool have
  already been updated while queued r1bios, allocated with the old
  raid_disks value, are later released. Consequently, free_r1bio() may
  access memory out of bounds in put_all_bios() and release r1bios of the
  wrong size to the new mempool, potentially causing issues with the
  mempool as well.

  Since only normal I/O might increase nr_queued while an I/O error occurs,
  suspending the array avoids this issue.

  Note: Updating raid_disks via ioctl SET_ARRAY_INFO already suspends
  the array. Therefore, we suspend the array when updating raid_disks
  via sysfs to avoid this issue too.
