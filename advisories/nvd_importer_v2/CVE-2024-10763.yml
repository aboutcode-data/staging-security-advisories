summary: The Campress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.35 via the 'campress_woocommerce_get_ajax_products' function. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on

  access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file
  type can be uploaded and included.
