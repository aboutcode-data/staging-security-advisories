aliases: []
summary: The 1003 Mortgage Application plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.87. This is due the /inc/class/fnm/export.php file
  being publicly accessible with error logging enabled. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other
  attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability
  to be present for damage to an affected website.
