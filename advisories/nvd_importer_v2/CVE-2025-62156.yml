aliases: []
summary: Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating
  parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Versions prior to 3.6.12 and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.2 contain
  a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in artifact extraction. During artifact extraction
  the unpack/untar logic (workflow/executor/executor.go) uses filepath.Join(dest, filepath.Clean(header.Name))
  without validating that header.Name stays within the intended extraction directory. A malicious
  archive entry can supply a traversal or absolute path that, after cleaning, overrides the
  destination directory and causes files to be written outside the /work/tmp extraction path
  and into system directories such as /etc inside the container. The vulnerability enables arbitrary
  file creation or overwrite in system configuration locations (for example /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts,
  /etc/crontab), which can lead to privilege escalation or persistence within the affected container.
  Update to 3.6.12 or 3.7.3 to remediate the issue.
