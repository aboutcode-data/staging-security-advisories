  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ksmbd: Fix refcount leak when invalid session is found on session lookup

  When a session is found but its state is not SMB2_SESSION_VALID, It
  indicates that no valid session was found, but it is missing to decrement
  the reference count acquired by the session lookup, which results in
  a reference count leak. This patch fixes the issue by explicitly calling
  ksmbd_user_session_put to release the reference to the session.
