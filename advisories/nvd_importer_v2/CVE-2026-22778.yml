aliases: []
summary: vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). From 0.8.3
  to before 0.14.1, when an invalid image is sent to vLLM's multimodal endpoint, PIL throws
  an error. vLLM returns this error to the client, leaking a heap address. With this leak, we
  reduce ASLR from 4 billion guesses to ~8 guesses. This vulnerability can be chained a heap
  overflow with JPEG2000 decoder in OpenCV/FFmpeg to achieve remote code execution. This vulnerability
  is fixed in 0.14.1.
