aliases: []
summary: In Administrate (rubygem) before version 0.13.0, when sorting by attributes on a dashboard,
  the direction parameter was not validated before being interpolated into the SQL query. This
  could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the `direction` parameter
  and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections. Whilst this does have a high-impact, to exploit this
  you need access to the Administrate dashboards, which we would expect to be behind authentication.
  This is patched in wersion 0.13.0.
