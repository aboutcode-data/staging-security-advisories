summary: 'Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. Versions before 10.10.7 are vulnerable
  to argument injection in FFmpeg. This can be leveraged to possibly achieve remote code execution
  by anyone with credentials to a low-privileged user. This vulnerability was previously reported
  in CVE-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. The original
  fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters
  can still be used for argument injection. The same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable:
  /Videos/<itemId>/stream and /Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>, likely alongside similar
  endpoints in AudioController. This argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary
  file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system. While the
  unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable, a valid itemId is required for exploitation and
  any authenticated attacker could easily retrieve a valid itemId to make the exploit work.
  This vulnerability is patched in version 10.10.7.'
