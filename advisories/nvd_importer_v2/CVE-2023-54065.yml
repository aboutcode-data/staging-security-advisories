  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: dsa: realtek: fix out-of-bounds access

  The probe function sets priv->chip_data to (void *)priv + sizeof(*priv)
  with the expectation that priv has enough trailing space.

  However, only realtek-smi actually allocated this chip_data space.
  Do likewise in realtek-mdio to fix out-of-bounds accesses.

  These accesses likely went unnoticed so far, because of an (unused)
  buf[4096] member in struct realtek_priv, which caused kmalloc to
  round up the allocated buffer to a big enough size, so nothing of
  value was overwritten. With a different allocator (like in the barebox
  bootloader port of the driver) or with KASAN, the memory corruption
  becomes quickly apparent.
