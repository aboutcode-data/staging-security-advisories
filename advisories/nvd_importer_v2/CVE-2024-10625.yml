aliases: []
summary: The WooCommerce Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_tmp_uploaded_file() function
  in all versions up to, and including, 17.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when
  the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
