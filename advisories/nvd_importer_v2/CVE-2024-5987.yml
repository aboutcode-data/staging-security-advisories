aliases: []
summary: The WP Accessibility Helper (WAH) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
  modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'save_contrast_variations' and
  'save_empty_contrast_variations' functions in all versions up to, and including, 0.6.2.8.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above,
  to edit or delete contrast settings.  Please note these issues were patched in 0.6.2.8, though
  it broke functionality and the vendor has not responded to our follow-ups.
