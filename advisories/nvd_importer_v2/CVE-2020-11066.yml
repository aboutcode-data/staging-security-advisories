aliases: []
summary: In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.17 and greater than or
  equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.2, calling unserialize() on malicious user-submitted content
  can lead to modification of dynamically-determined object attributes and result in triggering
  deletion of an arbitrary directory in the file system, if it is writable for the web server.
  It can also trigger message submission via email using the identity of the web site (mail
  relay). Another insecure deserialization vulnerability is required to actually exploit mentioned
  aspects. This has been fixed in 9.5.17 and 10.4.2.
