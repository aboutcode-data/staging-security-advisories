aliases: []
summary: A Local Privilege Escalation issue was discovered in Avast Secure Browser 76.0.1659.101.
  The vulnerability is due to an insecure ACL set by the AvastBrowserUpdate.exe (which is running
  as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) when AvastSecureBrowser.exe checks for new updates. When the update
  check is triggered, the elevated process cleans the ACL of the Update.ini file in %PROGRAMDATA%\Avast
  Software\Browser\Update\ and sets all privileges to group Everyone. Because any low-privileged
  user can create, delete, or modify the Update.ini file stored in this location, an attacker
  with low privileges can create a hard link named Update.ini in this folder, and make it point
  to a file writable by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Once AvastBrowserUpdate.exe is triggered by the
  update check functionality, the DACL is set to a misconfigured value on the crafted Update.ini
  and, consequently, to the target file that was previously not writable by the low-privileged
  attacker.
