aliases: []
summary: OpenSourcePOS 3.4.1 has a second order SQL Injection vulnerability in the handling
  of the currency_symbol configuration field. Although the input is initially stored without
  immediate execution, it is later concatenated into a dynamically constructed SQL query without
  proper sanitization or parameter binding. This allows an attacker with access to modify the
  currency_symbol value to inject arbitrary SQL expressions, which are executed when the affected
  query is subsequently processed.
