summary: The WP JobHunt plugin for WordPress, used by the JobCareer theme, is vulnerable to
  authorization bypass in all versions up to, and including, 7.6. This is due to insufficient
  login restrictions on inactive and pending accounts. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Candidate- and Employer-level access and above, to log in to the site even
  if their account is inactive or pending.
