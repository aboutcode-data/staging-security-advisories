aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in KaiOS 1.0, 2.5, and 2.5.12.5. The pre-installed Email application
  is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. An attacker can send a specially crafted
  email to the victim that will inject HTML into the email application's UI as soon as the email
  is opened. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Email application's
  UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter their email credentials)
  and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.
