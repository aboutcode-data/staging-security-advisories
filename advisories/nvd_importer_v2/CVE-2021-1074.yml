summary: NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows installer contains a vulnerability where an attacker
  with local unprivileged system access may be able to replace an application resource with
  malicious files. This attack requires a user with system administration rights to execute

  file integrity validation and execution. Such an attack may lead to code execution, escalation
  of privileges, denial of service, and information disclosure.
