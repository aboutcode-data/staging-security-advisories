aliases: []
summary: 'VMware Workstation 5.5.3 build 34685 does not provide per-user restrictions on certain
  privileged actions, which allows local users to perform restricted operations such as changing
  system time, accessing hardware components, and stopping the "VMware tools service" service.
  NOTE: exploitation is simplified via (1) weak file permissions (Users = Read & Execute) for
  %PROGRAMFILES%\VMware; and weak registry key permissions (access by Users) for (2) vmmouse,
  (3) vmscsi, (4) VMTools, (5) vmx_svga, and (6) vmxnet in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\;
  which allows local users to perform various privileged actions outside of the guest OS by
  executing certain files under %PROGRAMFILES%\VMware\VMware Tools, as demonstrated by (a) VMControlPanel.cpl
  and (b) vmwareservice.exe.'
