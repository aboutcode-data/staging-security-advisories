aliases: []
summary: Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to version
  1.5.2, the request body parsing in `starlite` allows a potentially unauthenticated attacker
  to consume a large amount of CPU time and RAM. The multipart body parser processes an unlimited
  number of file parts and an unlimited number of field parts. This is a remote, potentially
  unauthenticated Denial of Service vulnerability. This vulnerability affects applications with
  a request handler that accepts a `Body(media_type=RequestEncodingType.MULTI_PART)`. The large
  amount of CPU time required for processing requests can block all available worker processes
  and significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user requests. The large
  amount of RAM accumulated while processing requests can lead to Out-Of-Memory kills. Complete
  DoS is achievable by sending many concurrent multipart requests in a loop. Version 1.51.2
  contains a patch for this issue.
