aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in the Masquerade module before 1.x-1.0.1 for Backdrop CMS.
  It allows people to temporarily switch to another user account. The module provides a "Masquerade
  as admin" permission to restrict people (who can masquerade) from switching to an account
  with administrative privileges. This permission is not always honored and may allow non-administrative
  users to masquerade as an administrator. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that
  an attacker must have a role with the "Masquerade as user" permission.
