summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/radeon: Remove calls to drm_put_dev()

  Since the allocation of the drivers main structure was changed to
  devm_drm_dev_alloc() drm_put_dev()'ing to trigger it to be free'd
  should be done by devres.

  However, drm_put_dev() is still in the probe error and device remove
  paths. When the driver fails to probe warnings like the following are
  shown because devres is trying to drm_put_dev() after the driver
  already did it.

  [    5.642230] radeon 0000:01:05.0: probe with driver radeon failed with error -22
  [    5.649605] ------------[ cut here ]------------
  [    5.649607] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
  [    5.649620] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 357 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xbe/0x110
