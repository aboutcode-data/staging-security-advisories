aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud talk is a self hosting messaging service. In versions prior to 12.3.0 the
  Nextcloud Android Talk application did not properly detect the lockscreen state when a call
  was incoming. If an attacker got physical access to the locked phone, and the victim received
  a phone call the attacker could gain access to the chat messages and files of the user. It
  is recommended that the Nextcloud Android Talk App is upgraded to 12.3.0. There are no known
  workarounds.
