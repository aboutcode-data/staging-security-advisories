aliases: []
summary: haml-coffee is a JavaScript templating solution. haml-coffee mixes pure template data
  with engine configuration options through the Express render API. More specifically, haml-coffee
  supports overriding a series of HTML helper functions through its configuration options. A
  vulnerable application that passes user controlled request objects to the haml-coffee template
  engine may introduce RCE vulnerabilities. Additionally control over the escapeHtml parameter
  through template configuration pollution ensures that haml-coffee would not sanitize template
  inputs that may result in reflected Cross Site Scripting attacks against downstream applications.
  There is currently no fix for these issues as of the publication of this CVE. The latest version
  of haml-coffee is currently 1.14.1. For complete details refer to the referenced GHSL-2021-025.
