aliases: []
summary: LaRecipe is an application that allows users to create documentation with Markdown
  inside a Laravel app. Versions prior to 2.8.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection
  (SSTI), which could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in vulnerable configurations.
  Attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive environment variables,
  and/or escalate access depending on server configuration. Users are strongly advised to upgrade
  to version v2.8.1 or later to receive a patch.
