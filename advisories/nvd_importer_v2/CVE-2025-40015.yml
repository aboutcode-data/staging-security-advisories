  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  media: stm32-csi: Fix dereference before NULL check

  In 'stm32_csi_start', 'csidev->s_subdev' is dereferenced directly while
  assigning a value to the 'src_pad'. However the same value is being
  checked against NULL at a later point of time indicating that there
  are chances that the value can be NULL.

  Move the dereference after the NULL check.
