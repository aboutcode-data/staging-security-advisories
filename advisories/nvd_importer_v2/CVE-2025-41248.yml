aliases: []
summary: |
  The Spring Security annotation detection mechanism may not correctly resolve annotations on methods within type hierarchies with a parameterized super type with unbounded generics. This can be an issue when using @PreAuthorize and other method security annotations, resulting in an authorization bypass.

  Your application may be affected by this if you are using Spring Security's @EnableMethodSecurity feature.

  You are not affected by this if you are not using @EnableMethodSecurity or if you do not use security annotations on methods in generic superclasses or generic interfaces.

  This CVE is published in conjunction with  CVE-2025-41249 https://spring.io/security/cve-2025-41249 .
