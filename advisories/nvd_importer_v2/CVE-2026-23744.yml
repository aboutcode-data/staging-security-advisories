aliases: []
summary: MCPJam inspector is the local-first development platform for MCP servers. Versions
  1.4.2 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, which allows
  an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request that triggers the installation of an MCP server,
  leading to RCE. Since MCPJam inspector by default listens on 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1,
  an attacker can trigger the RCE remotely via a simple HTTP request. Version 1.4.3 contains
  a patch.
