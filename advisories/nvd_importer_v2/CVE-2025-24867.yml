aliases: []
summary: SAP BusinessObjects Platform (BI Launchpad) does not sufficiently handle user input,
  resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application allows an unauthenticated
  attacker to craft a URL that embeds a malicious script within an unprotected parameter. When
  a victim clicks the link, the script will be executed in the browser, giving the attacker
  the ability to access and/or modify information related to the web client with no effect on
  availability.
