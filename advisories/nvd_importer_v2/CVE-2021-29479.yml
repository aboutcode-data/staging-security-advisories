aliases: []
summary: Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior to 1.9.0, a user
  supplied `X-Forwarded-Host` header can be used to perform cache poisoning of a cache fronting
  a Ratpack server if the cache key does not include the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as a cache
  key. Users are only vulnerable if they do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance.
  For versions prior to 1.9.0, by default, Ratpack utilizes an inferring version of `PublicAddress`
  which is vulnerable. This can be used to perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker
  can force a cached redirect to redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location.
  The vulnerability was patched in Ratpack 1.9.0. As a workaround, ensure that `ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress`
  correctly configures the server in production.
