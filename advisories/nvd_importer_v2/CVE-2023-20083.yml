aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in ICMPv6 inspection when configured with the Snort 2 detection engine
  for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
  to cause the CPU of an affected device to spike to 100 percent, which could stop all traffic
  processing and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. FTD management traffic is not
  affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to improper error checking when
  parsing fields within the ICMPv6 header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
  a crafted ICMPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
  to cause the device to exhaust CPU resources and stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS
  condition. Note: To recover from the DoS condition, the Snort 2 Detection Engine or the Cisco
  FTD device may need to be restarted.'
