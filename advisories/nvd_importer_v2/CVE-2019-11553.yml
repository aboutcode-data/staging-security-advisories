aliases: []
summary: In Code42 for Enterprise through 6.8.4, an administrator without web restore permission
  but with the ability to manage users in an organization can impersonate a user with web restore
  permission. When requesting the token to do a web restore, an administrator with permission
  to manage a user could request the token of that user. If the administrator was not authorized
  to perform web restores but the user was authorized to perform web restores, this would allow
  the administrator to impersonate the user with greater permissions. In order to exploit this
  vulnerability, the user would have to be an administrator with access to manage an organization
  with a user with greater permissions than themselves.
