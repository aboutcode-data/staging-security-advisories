aliases: []
summary: The LWS Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to
  insufficient file path validation in the 'lws_cl_delete_file' function in all versions up
  to, and including, 2.4.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level
  access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote
  code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
