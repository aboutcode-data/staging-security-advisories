summary: 'The Avada | Website Builder For WordPress & eCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin''s fusion_button shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 3.11.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
  supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in 3.11.9. Additional
  hardening for alternate attack vectors was added to version 3.11.10.'
