summary: 'RustCrypto: Signatures offers support for digital signatures, which provide authentication
  of data using public-key cryptography. Prior to version 0.1.0-rc.2, a timing side-channel
  was discovered in the Decompose algorithm which is used during ML-DSA signing to generate
  hints for the signature. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.0-rc.2.'
