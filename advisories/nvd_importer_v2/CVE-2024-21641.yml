aliases: []
summary: Flarum is open source discussion platform software. Prior to version 1.8.5, the Flarum
  `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users
  from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. For logged-in
  users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used
  by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation.
  The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. As a workaround, some
  extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe.
