summary: The Pie Register - Social Sites Login (Add on) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
  authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.7.7. This is due to insufficient
  verification on the user being supplied during a social login through the plugin. This makes
  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such
  as an administrator, if they have access to the email.
