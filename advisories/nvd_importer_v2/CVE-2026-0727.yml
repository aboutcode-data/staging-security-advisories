aliases: []
summary: The Accordion and Accordion Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
  bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This is due to the plugin not properly
  verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the 'wp_aas_save_attachment_data'
  and 'wp_aas_get_attachment_edit_form' functions. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with contributor level access and above, to read and modify attachment metadata
  including file paths, titles, captions, alt text, and custom links for any attachment on the
  site.
