aliases: []
summary: The Coil Web Monetization plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
  validation on the coil-get-css-selector parameter handling in the maybe_restrict_content function.
  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger CSS selector detection functionality
  via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
  such as clicking on a link.
