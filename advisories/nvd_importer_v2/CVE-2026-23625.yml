aliases: []
summary: 'OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Versions 16.3.0
  through 16.6.4 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Roadmap
  view. OpenProject’s roadmap view renders the “Related work packages” list for each version.
  When a version contains work packages from a different project (e.g., a subproject), the helper
  link_to_work_package prepends package.project.to_s to the link and returns the entire string
  with .html_safe. Because project names are user-controlled and no escaping happens before
  calling html_safe, any HTML placed in a subproject name is injected verbatim into the page.
  The underlying issue is mitigated in versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.0 by setting a `X-Content-Type-Options:
  nosniff` header, which was in place until a refactoring move to Rails standard content-security
  policy, which did not properly apply this header in the new configuration since OpenProject
  16.3.0. Those who cannot upgrade their installations should ensure that they add a X-Content-Type-Options:
  nosniff header in their proxying web application server.'
