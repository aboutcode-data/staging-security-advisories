aliases: []
summary: The WP HTML Author Bio WordPress plugin through 1.2.0 does not sanitise the HTML allowed
  in the Bio of users, allowing them to use malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed
  when anyone visit a post in the frontend made by such user. As a result, user with a role
  as low as author could perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against users, which could potentially
  lead to privilege escalation when an admin view the related post/s.
