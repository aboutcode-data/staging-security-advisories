summary: 'Rejected reason: ** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none.
  Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was
  not a security issue. Notes: The code maintainer explains that "[the] call is invalid [as]
  the buffer pointed to by "data" must have "len" valid bytes." The documentation was fixed
  to make that clear.'
