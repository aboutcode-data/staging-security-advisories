aliases: []
summary: 'hyper is an open-source HTTP library for Rust (crates.io). In hyper from version 0.12.0
  and before versions 0.13.10 and 0.14.3 there is a vulnerability that can enable a request
  smuggling attack. The HTTP server code had a flaw that incorrectly understands some requests
  with multiple transfer-encoding headers to have a chunked payload, when it should have been
  rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that understands the request
  payload boundary differently can result in "request smuggling" or "desync attacks". To determine
  if vulnerable, all these things must be true: 1) Using hyper as an HTTP server (the client
  is not affected), 2) Using HTTP/1.1 (HTTP/2 does not use transfer-encoding), 3) Using a vulnerable
  HTTP proxy upstream to hyper. If an upstream proxy correctly rejects the illegal transfer-encoding
  headers, the desync attack cannot succeed. If there is no proxy upstream of hyper, hyper cannot
  start the desync attack, as the client will repair the headers before forwarding. This is
  fixed in versions 0.14.3 and 0.13.10. As a workaround one can take the following options:
  1) Reject requests that contain a `transfer-encoding` header, 2) Ensure any upstream proxy
  handles `transfer-encoding` correctly.'
