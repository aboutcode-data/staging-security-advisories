aliases: []
summary: The HAPPY – Helpdesk Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
  bypass due to a missing capability check on the 'submit_form_reply' AJAX action in all versions
  up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level
  access and above, to submit replies to arbitrary support tickets by manipulating the 'happy_topic_id'
  parameter, regardless of whether they are the ticket owner or have been assigned to the ticket.
