aliases: []
summary: Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. In version 2.17.0,
  rate limits can be completely bypassed by manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header. This renders
  IP-based rate limiting ineffective against determined attackers. Litestar's RateLimitMiddleware
  uses `cache_key_from_request()` to generate cache keys for rate limiting. When an X-Forwarded-For
  header is present, the middleware trusts it unconditionally and uses its value as part of
  the client identifier. Since clients can set arbitrary X-Forwarded-For values, each different
  spoofed IP creates a separate rate limit bucket. An attacker can rotate through different
  header values to avoid hitting any single bucket's limit. This affects any Litestar application
  using RateLimitMiddleware with default settings, which likely includes most applications that
  implement rate limiting. Version 2.18.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.
