aliases: []
summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in SeedDMS (formerly
  LetoDMS and MyDMS) before 5.1.8 by adding a system command at the end of the "cacheDir" path
  and following usage of the "Clear Cache" functionality. This allows an authenticated attacker,
  with permission to the Settings functionality, to inject arbitrary system commands within
  the application by manipulating the "Cache directory" path. An attacker can use it to perform
  malicious tasks such as to extract, change, or delete sensitive information or run system
  commands on the underlying operating system.
