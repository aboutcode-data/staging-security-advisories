summary: A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the HPE Moonshot Provisioning
  Manager v1.20. The HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager is an application that is installed in
  a VMWare or Microsoft Hyper-V environment that is used to setup and configure an HPE Moonshot
  1500 chassis. This vulnerability could be remotely exploited by an unauthenticated user to
  cause a directory traversal in user supplied input to the `khuploadfile.cgi` CGI ELF. The
  directory traversal could lead to Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, and/or compromise
  system integrity. **Note:** HPE recommends that customers discontinue the use of the HPE Moonshot
  Provisioning Manager. The HPE Moonshot Provisioning Manager application is discontinued, no
  longer supported, is not available to download from the HPE Support Center, and no patch is
