aliases: []
summary: 'Certain communication between PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services inadvertently use
  TLS 1.0, which is known to be a cryptographically weak protocol. These cloud services include
  Cortex Data Lake, the Customer Support Portal, and the Prisma Access infrastructure. Conditions
  required for exploitation of known TLS 1.0 weaknesses do not exist for the communication between
  PAN-OS and cloud-delivered services. We do not believe that any communication is impacted
  as a result of known attacks against TLS 1.0. This issue impacts: All versions of PAN-OS 8.0;
  PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.14; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9;
  PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3. PAN-OS 7.1 is not impacted by this issue.'
