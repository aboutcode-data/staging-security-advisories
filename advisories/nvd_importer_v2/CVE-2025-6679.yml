aliases: []
summary: The Bit Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due
  to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 2.20.4. This makes it
  possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
  which may make remote code execution possible. For this to be exploitable, the PRO version
  needs to be installed and activated as well. Additionally a form with an advanced file upload
  element needs to be published.
