summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications\
  \ Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition\
  \ (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting\
  \ (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the\
  \ web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker\
  \ could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the\
  \ interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code\
  \ in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\
  \ To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials."
