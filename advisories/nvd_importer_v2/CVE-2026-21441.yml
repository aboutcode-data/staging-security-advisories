aliases: []
summary: urllib3 is an HTTP client library for Python. urllib3's streaming API is designed for
  the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than
  loading the entire response body into memory at once. urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression
  based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When
  using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial
  content consumption. Starting in version 1.22 and prior to version 2.6.3, for HTTP redirect
  responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress
  the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called,
  and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result,
  there was no safeguard against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this
  to trigger excessive resource consumption on the client. Applications and libraries are affected
  when they stream content from untrusted sources by setting `preload_content=False` when they
  do not disable redirects. Users should upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.3, in which the library
  does not decode content of redirect responses when `preload_content=False`. If upgrading is
  not immediately possible, disable redirects by setting `redirect=False` for requests to untrusted
  source.
