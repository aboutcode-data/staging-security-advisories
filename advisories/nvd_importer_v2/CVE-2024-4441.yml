aliases: []
summary: The XML Sitemap & Google News plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion
  in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.8 via the 'feed' parameter. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing
  the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls,
  obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file
  types can be uploaded and included.
