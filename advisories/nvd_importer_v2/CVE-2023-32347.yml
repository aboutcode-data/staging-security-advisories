aliases: []
summary: Teltonika’s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 use device serial numbers
  and MAC addresses to identify devices from the user perspective for device claiming and from
  the device perspective for authentication. If an attacker obtained the serial number and MAC
  address of a device, they could authenticate as that device and steal communication credentials
  of the device. This could allow an attacker to enable arbitrary command execution as root
  by utilizing management options within the newly registered devices.
