aliases: []
summary: The TCP protocol in RFC 9293 has a timing side channel that makes it easier for remote
  attackers to infer the content of one TCP connection from a client system (to any server),
  when that client system is concurrently obtaining TCP data at a slow rate from an attacker-controlled
  server, aka the "SnailLoad" issue. For example, the attack can begin by measuring RTTs via
  the TCP segments whose role is to provide an ACK control bit and an Acknowledgment Number.
