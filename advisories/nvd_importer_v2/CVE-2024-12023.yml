aliases: []
summary: The FULL – Cliente plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'formId'
  parameter in all versions 3.1.5 to 3.1.25 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
  parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional
  SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information
  from the database. This is only exploitable when the PRO version of the plugin is activated,
  along with Elementor Pro and  Elementor CRM.
