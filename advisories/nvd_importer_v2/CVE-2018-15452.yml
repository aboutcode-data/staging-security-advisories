aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the DLL loading component of Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP)
  for Endpoints on Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to disable system scanning
  services or take other actions to prevent detection of unauthorized intrusions. To exploit
  this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative credentials on the Windows
  system. The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of resources loaded by a system
  process at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious
  DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to disable the targeted system's scanning services and ultimately
  prevent the system from being protected from further intrusion. There are no workarounds that
  address this vulnerability.
