summary: "A vulnerability in Cisco Meraki Systems Manager (SM) Agent for Windows could allow\
  \ an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.&nbsp;\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory search paths at runtime.\
  \ A low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing both malicious configuration\
  \ files and malicious DLL files on an affected system, which would read and execute the files\
  \ when Cisco Meraki SM launches on startup. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with SYSTEM privileges.&nbsp;"
