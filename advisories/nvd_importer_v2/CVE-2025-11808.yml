summary: The Shortcode for Google Street View plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
  Scripting via the 'streetview' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.5.7. This
  is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'id' attribute. This
  makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to
  inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected
  page.
