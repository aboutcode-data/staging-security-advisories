aliases: []
summary: DHIS2 is an information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics
  and visualization. A SQL injection security vulnerability affects the `/api/programs/orgUnits?programs=`
  API endpoint in DHIS2 versions prior to 2.36.10.1 and 2.37.6.1. The system is vulnerable to
  attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2, and there is no known way of exploiting
  the vulnerability without first being logged in as a DHIS2 user. The vulnerability is not
  exposed to a non-malicious user and requires a conscious attack to be exploited. A successful
  exploit of this vulnerability could allow the malicious user to read, edit and delete data
  in the DHIS2 instance's database. Security patches are now available for DHIS2 versions 2.36.10.1
  and 2.37.6.1. One may apply mitigations at the web proxy level as a workaround. More information
  about these mitigations is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
