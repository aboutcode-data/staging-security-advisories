summary: FastTrack Admin By Request 6.1.0.0 supports group policies that are supposed to allow
  only a select range of users to elevate to Administrator privilege at will. When a user requests
  elevation using the AdminByRequest.exe interface, the interface communicates with the underlying
  service (Audckq32.exe) using a .NET named pipe. If the underlying service responds that a
  user is permitted access to the elevation feature, the client then reinitiates communication
  with the underlying service and requests elevation. This elevation request has no local checks
  in the service, and depends on client-side validation in the AdminByRequest.exe interface,
  i.e., it is a vulnerable exposed functionality in the service. By communicating directly with
  the underlying service, any user can request elevation and obtain Administrator privilege
  regardless of group policies or permissions.
