aliases: []
summary: 'The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in
  all versions up to, and including, 6.0.7.1. This is due to the ''add_menu'' function is accessible
  via the ''rm_user_exists'' AJAX action and allows arbitrary updates to the ''admin_order''
  setting. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to injecting an empty slug into
  the order parameter, and manipulate the plugin''s menu generation logic, and when the admin
  menu is subsequently built, the plugin adds ''manage_options'' capability for the target role.
  Note: The vulnerability can only be exploited unauthenticated, but further privilege escalation
  requires at least a subscriber user.'
