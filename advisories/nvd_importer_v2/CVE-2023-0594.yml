summary: "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nStarting\
  \ with the 7.0 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability in the trace view visualization.\
  \ \n\nThe stored XSS vulnerability was possible due the value of a span's attributes/resources\
  \ were not properly sanitized and this will be rendered when the span's attributes/resources\
  \ are expanded.\n\nAn attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change the value\
  \ of a trace view visualization to contain JavaScript. \n\nThis means that vertical privilege\
  \ escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for\
  \ a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing\
  \ a dashboard. \n\nUsers may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix."
