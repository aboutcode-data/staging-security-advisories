aliases: []
summary: Code injection vulnerability in Bitdefender Total Security 12.0 (and earlier), Internet
  Security 12.0 (and earlier), and Antivirus Plus 12.0 (and earlier) allows a local attacker
  to bypass a self-protection mechanism, inject arbitrary code, and take full control of any
  Bitdefender process via a "DoubleAgent" attack. One perspective on this issue is that (1)
  these products do not use the Protected Processes feature, and therefore an attacker can enter
  an arbitrary Application Verifier Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options in the registry;
  (2) the self-protection mechanism is intended to block all local processes (regardless of
  privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options for these products; and (3) this mechanism
  can be bypassed by an attacker who temporarily renames Image File Execution Options during
  the attack.
