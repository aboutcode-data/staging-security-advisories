aliases: []
summary: Agenta is an open-source LLMOps platform. In Agenta-API prior to version 0.48.1, a
  Python sandbox escape vulnerability existed in Agenta's custom code evaluator. Agenta used
  RestrictedPython as a sandboxing mechanism for user-supplied evaluator code, but incorrectly
  whitelisted the `numpy` package as safe within the sandbox. This allowed authenticated users
  to bypass the sandbox and achieve arbitrary code execution on the API server. The escape path
  was through `numpy.ma.core.inspect`, which exposes Python's introspection utilities — including
  `sys.modules` — thereby providing access to unfiltered system-level functionality like `os.system`.
  This vulnerability affects the Agenta self-hosted platform (API server), not the SDK when
  used as a standalone Python library. The custom code evaluator runs server-side within the
  API process. The issue is fixed in v0.48.1 by removing `numpy` from the sandbox allowlist.
  In later versions (v0.60+), the RestrictedPython sandbox was removed entirely and replaced
  with a different execution model.
