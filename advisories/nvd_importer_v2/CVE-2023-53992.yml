aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: cfg80211: ocb: don't leave if not joined

  If there's no OCB state, don't ask the driver/mac80211 to
  leave, since that's just confusing. Since set/clear the
  chandef state, that's a simple check.
