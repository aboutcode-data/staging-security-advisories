aliases: []
summary: mailcow is a dockerized email package, with multiple containers linked in one bridged
  network. The Sync Job feature - which can be made available to standard users by assigning
  them the necessary permission - suffers from a shell command injection. A malicious user can
  abuse this vulnerability to obtain shell access to the Docker container running dovecot. The
  imapsync Perl script implements all the necessary functionality for this feature, including
  the XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism. This code path creates a shell command to call openssl.
  However, since different parts of the specified user password are included without any validation,
  one can simply execute additional shell commands. Notably, the default ACL for a newly-created
  mailcow account does not include the necessary permission. The Issue has been fixed within
  the 2023-03 Update (March 3rd 2023). As a temporary workaround the Syncjob ACL can be removed
  from all mailbox users, preventing from creating or changing existing Syncjobs.
