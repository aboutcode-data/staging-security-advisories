summary: Cacheservice did not correctly check if relative cache object were pointing to the
  defined absolute location when accessing resources. An attacker with access to the database
  and a local or restricted network would be able to read arbitrary local file system resources
  that are accessible by the services system user account. We have improved path validation
  and make sure that any access is contained to the defined root directory. No publicly available
  exploits are known.
