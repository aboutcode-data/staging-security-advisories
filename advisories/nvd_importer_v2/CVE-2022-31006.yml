aliases: []
summary: indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger purpose-built
  for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the
  number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for
  its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will
  resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience
  and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the
  network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune
  their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The
  guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks
  has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost
  and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the
  Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations
  should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.
