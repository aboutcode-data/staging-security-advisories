summary: net-tools is a collection of programs that form the base set of the NET-3 networking
  distribution for the Linux operating system. Inn versions up to and including 2.10, the Linux
  network utilities (like ifconfig) from the net-tools package do not properly validate the
  structure of /proc files when showing interfaces. `get_name()` in `interface.c` copies interface
  labels from `/proc/net/dev` into a fixed 16-byte stack buffer without bounds checking, leading
  to possible arbitrary code execution or crash. The known attack path does not require privilege
  but also does not provide privilege escalation in this scenario. A patch is available and
  expected to be part of version 2.20.
