aliases: []
summary: The Symantec Messaging Gateway can encounter a file inclusion vulnerability, which
  is a type of vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely
  on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable
  code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which
  file is executed at run time. This file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application
  loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result
  in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application.
