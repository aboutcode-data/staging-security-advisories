aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in Open Cluster Management (OCM) when a user has access to the worker
  nodes which contain the cluster-manager or klusterlet deployments. The cluster-manager deployment
  uses a service account with the same name "cluster-manager" which is bound to a ClusterRole
  also named "cluster-manager", which includes the permission to create Pod resources. If this
  deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's
  token and steal any service account token by creating and mounting the target service account
  to control the whole cluster.
