aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. A vulnerability
  has been identified in the authentication and authorization process of the endpoint responsible
  for altering the metadata of an emergency access. It permits an attacker with granted emergency
  access to escalate their privileges by changing the access level and modifying the wait time.
  Consequently, the attacker can gain full control over the vault (when only intended to have
  read access) while bypassing the necessary wait period.
