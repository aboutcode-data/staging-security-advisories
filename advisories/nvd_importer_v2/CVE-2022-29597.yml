aliases: []
summary: Solutions Atlantic Regulatory Reporting System (RRS) v500 is vulnerable to Local File
  Inclusion (LFI). Any authenticated user has the ability to reference internal system files
  within requests made to the RRSWeb/maint/ShowDocument/ShowDocument.aspx page. The server will
  successfully respond with the file contents of the internal system file requested. This ability
  could allow for adversaries to extract sensitive data and/or files from the underlying file
  system, gain knowledge about the internal workings of the system, or access source code of
  the application.
