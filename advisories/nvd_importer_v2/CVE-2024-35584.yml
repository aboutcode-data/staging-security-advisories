aliases: []
summary: SQL injection vulnerabilities were discovered in Ajax.php, ForWindow.php, ForExport.php,
  Modules.php, functions/HackingLogFnc.php in OpenSis Community Edition 9.1 to 8.0, and possibly
  earlier versions. It is possible for an authenticated user to perform SQL Injection due to
  the lack to sanitisation. The application takes arbitrary value from "X-Forwarded-For" header
  and appends it to a SQL INSERT statement directly, leading to SQL Injection.
