aliases: []
summary: The Avatar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient
  file path validation in a function in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.4. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete
  arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right
  file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
