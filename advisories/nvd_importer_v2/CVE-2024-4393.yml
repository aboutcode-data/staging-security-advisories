summary: The Social Connect plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to insufficient verification on the OpenID server being
  supplied during the social login through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have
  access to the email.
