summary: The Slippy Slider – Responsive Touch Navigation Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slippy-slider' shortcode in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
  supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level
  access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
  accesses an injected page.
