aliases: []
summary: The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation
  via authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to the plugin
  not properly validating a user's cookie value prior to logging them in through the service_finder_switch_back()
  function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user including
  admins.
