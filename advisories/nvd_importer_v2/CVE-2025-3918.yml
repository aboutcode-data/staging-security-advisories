aliases: []
summary: The Job Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to
  improper authorization within the register_action() function in versions 0.1 to 0.1.1. The
  plugin’s registration handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['user_role'] and passes it
  directly to wp_insert_user() without restricting to a safe set of roles.  This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.
