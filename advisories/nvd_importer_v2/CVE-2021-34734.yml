aliases: []
summary: 'A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for the
  Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
  attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper
  management of memory resources, referred to as a double free. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit
  could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
  Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in
  the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).'
