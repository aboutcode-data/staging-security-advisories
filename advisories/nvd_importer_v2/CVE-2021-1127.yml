summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure
  Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due
  to improper input validation of log file content stored on the affected device. An attacker

  user to view the modified log file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based
  information.
