aliases: []
summary: PsySH is a runtime developer console, interactive debugger, and REPL for PHP. Prior
  to versions 0.11.23 and 0.12.19, PsySH automatically loads and executes a `.psysh.php` file
  from the Current Working Directory (CWD) on startup. If an attacker can write to a directory
  that a victim later uses as their CWD when launching PsySH, the attacker can trigger arbitrary
  code execution in the victim's context. When the victim runs PsySH with elevated privileges
  (e.g., root), this results in local privilege escalation. This is a CWD configuration poisoning
  issue leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim user’s context. If a privileged user
  (e.g., root, a CI runner, or an ops/debug account) launches PsySH with CWD set to an attacker-writable
  directory containing a malicious `.psysh.php`, the attacker can execute commands with that
  privileged user’s permissions, resulting in local privilege escalation. Downstream consumers
  that embed PsySH inherit this risk. For example, Laravel Tinker (`php artisan tinker`) uses
  PsySH. If a privileged user runs Tinker while their shell is in an attacker-writable directory,
  the `.psysh.php` auto-load behavior can be abused in the same way to execute attacker-controlled
  code under the victim’s privileges. Versions 0.11.23 and 0.12.19 patch the issue.
