aliases: []
summary: ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. Prior to Beta 0.9.26020, ADB Explorer
  is vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization leading to Remote Code Execution. The application
  attempts to deserialize the App.txt settings file using Newtonsoft.Json with TypeNameHandling
  set to Objects. This allows an attacker to supply a crafted JSON file containing a gadget
  chain (e.g., ObjectDataProvider) to execute arbitrary code when the application launches and
  subsequently saves its settings. This vulnerability is fixed in Beta 0.9.26020.
