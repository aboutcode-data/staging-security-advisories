summary: 'A vulnerability in the RADIUS authentication module of Cisco Policy Suite could allow
  an unauthenticated, remote attacker to be authorized as a subscriber without providing a valid
  password; however, the attacker must provide a valid username. The vulnerability is due to
  incorrect RADIUS user credential validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by attempting to access a Cisco Policy Suite domain configured with RADIUS authentication.
  An exploit could allow the attacker to be authorized as a subscriber without providing a valid
  password. This vulnerability affects the Cisco Policy Suite application running a release
  prior to 13.1.0 with Hotfix Patch 1 when RADIUS authentication is configured for a domain.
  Cisco Policy Suite Release 14.0.0 is also affected, as it includes vulnerable code, but RADIUS
  authentication is not officially supported in Cisco Policy Suite Releases 14.0.0 and later.
