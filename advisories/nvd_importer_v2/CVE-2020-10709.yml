aliases: []
summary: A security flaw was found in Ansible Tower when requesting an OAuth2 token with an
  OAuth2 application. Ansible Tower uses the token to provide authentication. This flaw allows
  an attacker to obtain a refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to
  the user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can gain access to
  the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions
  before 3.6.4 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6.
