aliases: []
summary: Nextcloud Password Policy is an app that enables a Nextcloud server admin to define
  certain rules for passwords. Prior to versions 22.2.10, 23.0.7, and 24.0.3 the random password
  generator may, in very rare cases, generate common passwords that the validator itself would
  block. Upgrade Nextcloud Server to 22.2.10, 23.0.7 or 24.0.3 to receive a patch for the issue
  in Password Policy. There are no known workarounds available.
