aliases: []
summary: Mailpit is an email testing tool and API for developers. Prior to version 1.28.2, the
  Mailpit WebSocket server is configured to accept connections from any origin. This lack of
  Origin header validation introduces a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability.
  An attacker can host a malicious website that, when visited by a developer running Mailpit
  locally, establishes a WebSocket connection to the victim's Mailpit instance (default ws://localhost:8025).
  This allows the attacker to intercept sensitive data such as email contents, headers, and
  server statistics in real-time. This issue has been patched in version 1.28.2.
