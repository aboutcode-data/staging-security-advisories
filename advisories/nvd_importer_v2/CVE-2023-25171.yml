aliases: []
summary: Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate limits in versions
  prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service attacks against the Password
  reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email
  addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP resources. Users should
  upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As potential workarounds, users may install
  and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on
  their email server when possible.
