aliases: []
summary: In Juju versions prior to 3.6.8 and 2.9.52, any authenticated controller user was allowed
  to upload arbitrary agent binaries to any model or to the controller itself, without verifying
  model membership or requiring explicit permissions. This enabled the distribution of poisoned
  binaries to new or upgraded machines, potentially resulting in remote code execution.
