aliases: []
summary: '`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project configuration files
  such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`,
  and more, from a well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen''s `NodeProject`
  project type (including any project type derived from it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml`
  workflow that may allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context
  of the "main" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted
  code may potentially be able to commit to the "main" repository. The rebuild-bot workflow
  is triggered by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build
  of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow
  is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging
  to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast with workflows
  triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to
  the repository from which the pull-request is made). Repositories that do not have branch
  protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or `master`) could possibly
  allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM
  tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would
  not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined
  on the default branch.'
