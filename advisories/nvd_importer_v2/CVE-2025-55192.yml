summary: 'HomeAssistant-Tapo-Control offers Control for Tapo cameras as a Home Assistant component.
  Prior to commit 2a3b80f, there is a code injection vulnerability in the GitHub Actions workflow
  .github/workflows/issues.yml. It does not affect users of the Home Assistant integration itself
  — it only impacts the GitHub Actions environment for this repository. The vulnerable workflow
  directly inserted user-controlled content from the issue body (github.event.issue.body) into
  a Bash conditional without proper sanitization. A malicious GitHub user could craft an issue
  body that executes arbitrary commands on the GitHub Actions runner in a privileged context
  whenever an issue is opened. The potential impact is limited to the repository’s CI/CD environment,
  which could allow access to repository contents or GitHub Actions secrets. This issue has
  been patched via commit 2a3b80f. Workarounds involve disabling the affected workflow (issues.yml),
  replacing the unsafe Bash comparison with a safe quoted grep (or a pure GitHub Actions expression
  check), or ensuring minimal permissions in workflows (permissions: block) to reduce possible
  impact.'
