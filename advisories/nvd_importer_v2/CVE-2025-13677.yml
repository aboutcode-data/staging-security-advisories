aliases: []
summary: The Simple Download Counter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in
  all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2. This is due to insufficient path validation in the
  `simple_download_counter_parse_path()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files
  on the server, which may contain sensitive information such as database credentials (wp-config.php)
  or system files. Please note that the vendor opted to continue to allow remote file downloads
  from arbitrary locations on the server, however, has disabled this functionality on multi-sites
  and provided a warning to site owners in the readme.txt when they install the plugin. While
  not an optimal patch, we have considered this sufficient and recommend users proceed to use
  the plugin with caution.
