aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DNA Center software
  could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
  against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the
  web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
  would need to have administrative credentials on the affected device.
