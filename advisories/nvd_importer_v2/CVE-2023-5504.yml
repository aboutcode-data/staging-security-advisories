aliases: []
summary: The BackWPup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions
  up to, and including, 4.0.1 via the Log File Folder. This allows authenticated attackers to
  store backups in arbitrary folders on the server provided they can be written to by the server.
  Additionally, default settings will place an index.php and a .htaccess file into the chosen
  directory (unless already present) when the first backup job is run that are intended to prevent
  directory listing and file access. This means that an attacker could set the backup directory
  to the root of another site in a shared environment and thus disable that site.
