aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in PrimeKey EJBCA 6.x and 7.x before 7.4.1. When using a client
  certificate to enroll over the EST protocol, no revocation check is performed on that certificate.
  This vulnerability can only affect a system that has EST configured, uses client certificates
  to authenticate enrollment, and has had such a certificate revoked. This certificate needs
  to belong to a role that is authorized to enroll new end entities. (To completely mitigate
  this problem prior to upgrade, remove any revoked client certificates from their respective
  roles.)
