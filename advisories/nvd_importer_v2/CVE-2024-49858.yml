  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  efistub/tpm: Use ACPI reclaim memory for event log to avoid corruption

  The TPM event log table is a Linux specific construct, where the data
  produced by the GetEventLog() boot service is cached in memory, and
  passed on to the OS using an EFI configuration table.

  The use of EFI_LOADER_DATA here results in the region being left
  unreserved in the E820 memory map constructed by the EFI stub, and this
  is the memory description that is passed on to the incoming kernel by
  kexec, which is therefore unaware that the region should be reserved.

  Even though the utility of the TPM2 event log after a kexec is
  questionable, any corruption might send the parsing code off into the
  weeds and crash the kernel. So let's use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORY
  instead, which is always treated as reserved by the E820 conversion
  logic.
