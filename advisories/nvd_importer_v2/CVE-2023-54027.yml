  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: core: Prevent invalid memory access when there is no parent

  Commit 813665564b3d ("iio: core: Convert to use firmware node handle
  instead of OF node") switched the kind of nodes to use for label
  retrieval in device registration.  Probably an unwanted change in that
  commit was that if the device has no parent then NULL pointer is
  accessed.  This is what happens in the stock IIO dummy driver when a
  new entry is created in configfs:

    # mkdir /sys/kernel/config/iio/devices/dummy/foo
    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: ...
    ...
    Call Trace:
    __iio_device_register
    iio_dummy_probe

  Since there seems to be no reason to make a parent device of an IIO
  dummy device mandatory, let’s prevent the invalid memory access in
  __iio_device_register when the parent device is NULL.  With this
  change, the IIO dummy driver works fine with configfs.
