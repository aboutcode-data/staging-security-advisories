summary: 'NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor. Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2002 allows
  remote attackers to send viruses that bypass the e-mail scanning via a NULL character in the
  MIME header before the virus.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging that
  the initial scan is bypassed, but the AutoProtect feature would detect the virus before it
  is executed'
