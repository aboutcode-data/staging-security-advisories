summary: The All-Images.ai – IA Image Bank and Custom Image creation plugin for WordPress is
  vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the '_get_image_by_url'

  attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected
  site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
