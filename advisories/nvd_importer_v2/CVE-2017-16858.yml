aliases: []
summary: 'The ''crowd-application'' plugin module (notably used by the Google Apps plugin) in
  Atlassian Crowd from version 1.5.0 before version 3.1.2 allowed an attacker to impersonate
  a Crowd user in REST requests by being able to authenticate to a directory bound to an application
  using the feature. Given the following situation: the Crowd application is bound to directory
  1 and has a user called admin and the Google Apps application is bound to directory 2, which
  also has a user called admin, it was possible to authenticate REST requests using the credentials
  of the user coming from directory 2 and impersonate the user from directory 1.'
