summary: A vulnerability in the configuration file protections of Cisco Virtualized Infrastructure
  Manager (VIM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access confidential information
  and elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper access
  permissions for certain configuration files. An attacker with low-privileged credentials could
  exploit this vulnerability by accessing an affected device and reading the affected configuration
  files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain internal database credentials,
  which the attacker could use to view and modify the contents of the database. The attacker
  could use this access to the database to elevate privileges on the affected device.
