aliases: []
summary: Karakeep is a elf-hostable bookmark-everything app. In version 0.30.0, when the Reddit
  metascraper plugin returns `readableContentHtml`, the HTML parsing subprocess uses it directly
  without running it through DOMPurify. Every other content source in the crawler goes through
  Readability + DOMPurify, but the Reddit path skips both. Since this content ends up in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  in the reader view, any malicious HTML in the Reddit response gets executed in the user's
  browser. Version 0.31.0 contains a patch for this issue.
