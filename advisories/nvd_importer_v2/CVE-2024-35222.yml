aliases: []
summary: Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. Remote
  origin iFrames in Tauri applications can access the Tauri IPC endpoints without being explicitly
  allowed in the `dangerousRemoteDomainIpcAccess` in v1 and in the `capabilities` in v2. Valid
  commands with potentially unwanted consequences ("delete project", "transfer credits", etc.)
  could be invoked by an attacker that controls the content of an iframe running inside a Tauri
  app. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 1.6.7 and 2.0.0-beta.19.
