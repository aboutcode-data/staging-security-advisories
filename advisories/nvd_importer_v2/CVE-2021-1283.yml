summary: A vulnerability in the logging subsystem of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)
  could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in a system log
  file that should be restricted. The vulnerability exists because sensitive information is
  not properly masked before it is written to system log files. An attacker could exploit this
  vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and inspecting a specific system log
  file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in the system
  log file. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid user credentials.
