summary: Strawberry GraphQL is a library for creating GraphQL APIs. Prior to version 0.243.0,
  multipart file upload support as defined in the GraphQL multipart request specification was
  enabled by default in all Strawberry HTTP view integrations. This made all Strawberry HTTP
  view integrations vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks if users did not
  explicitly enable CSRF preventing security mechanism for their servers. Additionally, the
  Django HTTP view integration, in particular, had an exemption for Django's built-in CSRF protection
  (i.e., the `CsrfViewMiddleware` middleware) by default. In affect, all Strawberry integrations
  were vulnerable to CSRF attacks by default. Version `v0.243.0` is the first `strawberry-graphql`
  including a patch.
