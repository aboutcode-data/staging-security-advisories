summary: "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow\
  \ an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\
  \ against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web UI does\
  \ not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could\
  \ allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface\
  \ or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ an attacker would need valid&nbsp;agent&nbsp;credentials."
