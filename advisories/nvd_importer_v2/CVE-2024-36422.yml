aliases: []
summary: Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model
  flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise, a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs in
  the `api/v1/chatflows/id` endpoint. If the default configuration is used (unauthenticated),
  an attacker may be able to craft a specially crafted URL that injects Javascript into the
  user sessions, allowing the attacker to steal information, create false popups, or even redirect
  the user to other websites without interaction. If the chatflow ID is not found, its value
  is reflected in the 404 page, which has type text/html. This allows an attacker to attach
  arbitrary scripts to the page, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information. This XSS
  may be chained with the path injection to allow an attacker without direct access to Flowise
  to read arbitrary files from the Flowise server. As of time of publication, no known patches
  are available.
