aliases: []
summary: In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm repository can contain duplicates
  of the same chart, with the last one always used. If a repository is compromised, this lowers
  the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository. To perform
  this attack, an attacker must have write access to the index file (which can occur during
  a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11.
  A possible workaround is to manually review the index file in the Helm repository cache before
  installing software.
