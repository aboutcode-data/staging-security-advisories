  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix iio_chan_spec for sensors without event detection

  The st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels array of struct iio_chan_spec has a non-NULL
  event_spec field, indicating support for IIO events. However, event
  detection is not supported for all sensors, and if userspace tries to
  configure accelerometer wakeup events on a sensor device that does not
  support them (e.g. LSM6DS0), st_lsm6dsx_write_event() dereferences a NULL
  pointer when trying to write to the wakeup register.
  Define an additional struct iio_chan_spec array whose members have a NULL
  event_spec field, and use this array instead of st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels for
  sensors without event detection capability.
