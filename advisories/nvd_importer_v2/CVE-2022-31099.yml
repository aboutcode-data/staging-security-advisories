aliases: []
summary: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex
  expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens
  when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to
  abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex
  expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable
  when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version
  **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds
  for this issue.
