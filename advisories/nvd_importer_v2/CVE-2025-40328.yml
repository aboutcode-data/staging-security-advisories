aliases: []
summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smb: client: fix potential UAF in smb2_close_cached_fid()

  find_or_create_cached_dir() could grab a new reference after kref_put()
  had seen the refcount drop to zero but before cfid_list_lock is acquired
  in smb2_close_cached_fid(), leading to use-after-free.

  Switch to kref_put_lock() so cfid_release() is called with
  cfid_list_lock held, closing that gap.
