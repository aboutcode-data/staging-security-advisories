  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: timer: Don't take register_mutex with copy_from/to_user()

  The infamous mmap_lock taken in copy_from/to_user() can be often
  problematic when it's called inside another mutex, as they might lead
  to deadlocks.

  In the case of ALSA timer code, the bad pattern is with
  guard(mutex)(&register_mutex) that covers copy_from/to_user() -- which
  was mistakenly introduced at converting to guard(), and it had been
  carefully worked around in the past.

  This patch fixes those pieces simply by moving copy_from/to_user() out
  of the register mutex lock again.
