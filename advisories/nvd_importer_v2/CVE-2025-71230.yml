summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  hfs: ensure sb->s_fs_info is always cleaned up

  When hfs was converted to the new mount api a bug was introduced by
  changing the allocation pattern of sb->s_fs_info. If setup_bdev_super()
  fails after a new superblock has been allocated by sget_fc(), but before
  hfs_fill_super() takes ownership of the filesystem-specific s_fs_info
  data it was leaked.

  Fix this by freeing sb->s_fs_info in hfs_kill_super().
