summary: |
  In Eclipse RAP versions from 3.0.0 up to and including 3.25.0, Remote Code Execution is possible on Windows when using the FileUpload component.






  The reason for this is a not completely secure extraction of the file name in the FileUploadProcessor.stripFileName(String name) method. As soon as this finds a / in the path, everything before it is removed, but potentially \ (backslashes) coming further back are kept.

  For example, a file name such as /..\..\webapps\shell.war can be used to upload a file to a Tomcat server under Windows, which is then saved as ..\..\webapps\shell.war in its webapps directory and can then be executed.
