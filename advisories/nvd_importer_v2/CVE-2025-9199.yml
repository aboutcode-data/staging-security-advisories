aliases: []
summary: The Woo superb slideshow transition gallery with random effect plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'woo-superb-slideshow' shortcode in all versions up
  to, and including, 9.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack
  of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated
  attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into
  already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
