summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites and Cisco Webex Meetings Online
  sites could allow an unauthenticated, remote attendee to join a password-protected meeting
  without providing the meeting password. The connection attempt must initiate from a Webex
  mobile application for either iOS or Android. The vulnerability is due to unintended meeting
  information exposure in a specific meeting join flow for mobile applications. An unauthorized
  attendee could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a known meeting ID or meeting URL from
  the mobile device&rsquo;s web browser. The browser will then request to launch the device&rsquo;s
  Webex mobile application. A successful exploit could allow the unauthorized attendee to join
  the password-protected meeting. The unauthorized attendee will be visible in the attendee
  list of the meeting as a mobile attendee. Cisco has applied updates that address this vulnerability
  and no user action is required. This vulnerability affects Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites
  and Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites releases earlier than 39.11.5 and 40.1.3.
