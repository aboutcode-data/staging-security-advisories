summary: 'An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Umbraco CMS v16.3.3 allows attackers to
  execute arbitrary code by uploading a crafted PDF file. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier
  because the responsibility for file validation (as shown in the documentation) belongs to
  the system administrator who is implementing Umbraco CMS in their environment, not to Umbraco
  CMS itself, a related issue to CVE-2023-49279.'
