aliases: []
summary: 'mshtml.dll in Microsoft Windows XP, Server 2003, and Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 allows
  attackers to cause a denial of service (access violation) by causing mshtml.dll to process
  button-focus events at the same time that a document is reloading, as seen in Microsoft Office
  InfoPath 2003 by repeatedly clicking the "Delete" button in a repeating section in a form.  NOTE:
  the normal operation of InfoPath appears to involve a local user without any privilege boundaries,
  so this might not be a vulnerability in InfoPath.  If no realistic scenarios exist for this
  problem in other products, then perhaps it should be excluded from CVE.'
