aliases: []
summary: In the Eclipse Theia Website repository, the GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/preview.yml
  used pull_request_target trigger while checking out and executing untrusted pull request code.
  This allowed any GitHub user to execute arbitrary code in the repository's CI environment
  with access to repository secrets and a GITHUB_TOKEN with extensive write permissions (contents:write,
  packages:write, pages:write, actions:write). An attacker could exfiltrate secrets, publish
  malicious packages to the eclipse-theia organization, modify the official Theia website, and
  push malicious code to the repository.
