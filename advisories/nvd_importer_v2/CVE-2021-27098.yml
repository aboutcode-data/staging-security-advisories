aliases: []
summary: In SPIRE 0.8.1 through 0.8.4 and before versions 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1,
  specially crafted requests to the FetchX509SVID RPC of SPIRE Server’s Legacy Node API can
  result in the possible issuance of an X.509 certificate with a URI SAN for a SPIFFE ID that
  the agent is not authorized to distribute. Proper controls are in place to require that the
  caller presents a valid agent certificate that is already authorized to issue at least one
  SPIFFE ID, and the requested SPIFFE ID belongs to the same trust domain, prior to being able
  to trigger this vulnerability. This issue has been fixed in SPIRE versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2,
  0.11.3 and 0.12.1.
