summary: In OpenWrt 19.07.x before 19.07.7, when IPv6 is used, a routing loop can occur that
  generates excessive network traffic between an affected device and its upstream ISP's router.
  This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address
  belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received
  with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set. This affects
  the netifd and odhcp6c packages.
