aliases: []
summary: "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact\
  \ Center Enterprise (Packaged CCE) and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE)\
  \ could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack\
  \ against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\
  These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate\
  \ user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious\
  \ code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker\
  \ to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive,\
  \ browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid\
  \ administrative credentials."
