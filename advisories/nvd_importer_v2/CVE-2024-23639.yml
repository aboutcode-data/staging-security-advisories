summary: Micronaut Framework is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for
  building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy
  language. Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost
  attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact
  on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought.
  A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests
  would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests
  are "simple" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured,
  are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints
  and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their
  local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing
  development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade.
