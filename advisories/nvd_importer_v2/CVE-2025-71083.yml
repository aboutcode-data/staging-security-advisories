summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/ttm: Avoid NULL pointer deref for evicted BOs

  It is possible for a BO to exist that is not currently associated with a
  resource, e.g. because it has been evicted.

  When devcoredump tries to read the contents of all BOs for dumping, we need
  to expect this as well -- in this case, ENODATA is recorded instead of the
  buffer contents.
