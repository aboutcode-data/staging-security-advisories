aliases: []
summary: The NtfsHandler.cpp NTFS handler in 7-Zip before 24.01 (for 7zz) contains an out-of-bounds
  read that allows an attacker to read beyond the intended buffer. The bytes read beyond the
  intended buffer are presented as a part of a filename listed in the file system image. This
  has security relevance in some known web-service use cases where untrusted users can upload
  files and have them extracted by a server-side 7-Zip process.
