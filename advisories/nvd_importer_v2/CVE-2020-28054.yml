summary: 'JamoDat TSMManager Collector version up to 6.5.0.21 is vulnerable to an Authorization
  Bypass because the Collector component is not properly validating an authenticated session
  with the Viewer. If the Viewer has been modified (binary patched) and the Bypass Login functionality
  is being used, an attacker can request every Collector''s functionality as if they were a
  properly logged-in user: administrating connected instances, reviewing logs, editing configurations,
  accessing the instances'' consoles, accessing hardware configurations, etc.Exploiting this
  vulnerability won''t grant an attacker access nor control on remote ISP servers as no credentials
  is sent with the request.'
