aliases: []
summary: 'The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in
  versions 1.0.8 to 1.3.9 via the ''content-dir'' HTTP header. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. NOTE: Successful
  exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the target server''s php.ini is configured
  with ''allow_url_include'' set to ''on''. This feature is deprecated as of PHP 7.4 and is
  disabled by default, but can still be explicitly enabled in later versions of PHP.'
