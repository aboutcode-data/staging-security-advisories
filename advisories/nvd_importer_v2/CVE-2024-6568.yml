aliases: []
summary: 'The Flamix: Bitrix24 and Contact Form 7 integrations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.0. This is due the plugin
  utilizing mobiledetect without preventing direct access to the files. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can
  be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires
  another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.'
