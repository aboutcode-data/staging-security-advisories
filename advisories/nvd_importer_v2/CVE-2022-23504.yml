summary: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. Versions prior to
  9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 are subject to Sensitive Information Disclosure. Due
  to the lack of handling user-submitted YAML placeholder expressions in the site configuration
  backend module, attackers could expose sensitive internal information, such as system configuration
  or HTTP request messages of other website visitors. A valid backend user account having administrator
  privileges is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in versions
  9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.
