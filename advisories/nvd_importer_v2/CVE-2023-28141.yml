summary: |
  An NTFS Junction condition exists in the Qualys Cloud Agent
  for Windows platform in versions before 4.8.0.31. Attackers may write files to
  arbitrary locations via a local attack vector. This allows attackers to assume
  the privileges of the process, and they may delete or otherwise on unauthorized
  files, allowing for the potential modification or deletion of sensitive files
  limited only to that specific directory/file object. This vulnerability is
  bounded to the time of installation/uninstallation and can only be exploited locally.



  At the time of this disclosure, versions before 4.0 are
  classified as End of Life.
