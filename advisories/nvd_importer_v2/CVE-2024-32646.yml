aliases: []
summary: Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. In versions
  0.3.10 and prior, using the `slice` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when
  the buffer argument is either `msg.data`, `self.code` or `<address>.code` and either the `start`
  or `length` arguments have side-effects. It can be easily triggered only with the versions
  `<0.3.4` as `0.3.4` introduced the unique symbol fence. No vulnerable production contracts
  were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable
  in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions
  are available.
