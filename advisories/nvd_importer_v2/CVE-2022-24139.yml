aliases: []
summary: In IOBit Advanced System Care (AscService.exe) 15, an attacker with SEImpersonatePrivilege
  can create a named pipe with the same name as one of ASCService's named pipes. ASCService
  first tries to connect before trying to create the named pipes, because of that during login
  the service will try to connect to the attacker which will lead to either escalation of privileges
  (through token manipulation and ImpersonateNamedPipeClient() ) from ADMIN -> SYSTEM or from
  Local ADMIN-> Domain ADMIN depending on the user and named pipe that is used.
