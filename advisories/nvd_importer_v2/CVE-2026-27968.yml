summary: Packistry is a self-hosted Composer repository designed to handle PHP package distribution.
  Prior to version 0.13.0, RepositoryAwareController::authorize() verified token presence and
  ability, but did not enforce token expiration. As a result, an expired deploy token with the
  correct ability could still access repository endpoints (e.g., Composer metadata/download
  APIs). The fix in version 0.13.0 adds an explicit expiration check, and tests now test expired
  deploy tokens to ensure they are rejected.
