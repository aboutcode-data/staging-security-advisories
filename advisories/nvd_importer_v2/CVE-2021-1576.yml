aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Business Process
  Automation (BPA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator.
  These vulnerabilities are due to improper authorization enforcement for specific features
  and for access to log files that contain confidential information. An attacker could exploit
  these vulnerabilities either by submitting crafted HTTP messages to an affected system and
  performing unauthorized actions with the privileges of an administrator, or by retrieving
  sensitive data from the logs and using it to impersonate a legitimate privileged user. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator.
