aliases: []
summary: MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded credentials that are used for customer database
  access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and the ability to communicate
  directly with the database may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial
  information. Connex utilizes an IBM i DB2 user account for database access. The account name
  is HMSCXPDN. Its password is hard-coded in multiple places in the application. Customers do
  not have the option to change this password. The account has elevated DB2 roles, and can access
  all objects or database tables on the customer DB2 database. This account can access data
  through ODBC, FTP, and TELNET. Customers without Connex installed are still vulnerable because
  the MEDHOST setup program creates this account.
