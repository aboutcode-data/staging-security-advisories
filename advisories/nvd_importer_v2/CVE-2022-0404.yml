aliases: []
summary: The Material Design for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin through 2.6.4 does not check
  authorization or that the option mentioned in the notice param belongs to the plugin when
  processing requests to the cf7md_dismiss_notice action, allowing any logged in user (with
  roles as low as Subscriber) to set arbitrary options to true, potentially leading to Denial
  of Service by breaking the site.
