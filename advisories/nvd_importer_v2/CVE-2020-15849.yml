summary: Re:Desk 2.3 has a blind authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the SettingsController
  class, in the actionEmailTemplates() method. A malicious actor with access to an administrative
  account could abuse this vulnerability to recover sensitive data from the application's database,
  allowing for authorization bypass and taking over additional accounts by means of modifying
  password-reset tokens stored in the database. Remote command execution is also possible by
  leveraging this to abuse the Yii framework's bizRule functionality, allowing for arbitrary
  PHP code to be executed by the application. Remote command execution is also possible by using
  this together with a separate insecure file upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-15488).
