summary: Redon Hub is a Roblox Product Delivery Bot, also known as a Hub. In all hubs before
  version 1.0.2, all commands are capable of being ran by all users, including admin commands.
  This allows users to receive products for free and delete/create/update products/tags/etc.
  The only non-affected command is `/products admin clear` as this was already programmed for
  bot owners only. All users should upgrade to version 1.0.2 to receive a patch.
