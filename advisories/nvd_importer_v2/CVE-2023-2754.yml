aliases: []
summary: The Cloudflare WARP client for Windows assigns loopback IPv4 addresses for the DNS
  Servers, since WARP acts as local DNS server that performs DNS queries in a secure manner,
  however, if a user is connected to WARP over an IPv6-capable network, te WARP client did not
  assign loopback IPv6 addresses but Unique Local Addresses, which under certain conditions
  could point towards unknown devices in the same local network which enables an Attacker to
  view DNS queries made by the device.
