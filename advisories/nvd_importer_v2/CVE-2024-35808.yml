summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly

  Currently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directly
  without holding 'reconfig_mutex', this is definitely unsafe because
  md_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by
  'reconfig_mutex'.

  However, hold 'reconfig_mutex' here is still problematic because this
  will cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b ("md: refactor
  idle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock").

  Fix this problem by using stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread,
  like md/raid did.
