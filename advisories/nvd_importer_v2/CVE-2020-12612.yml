aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in BeyondTrust Privilege Management for Windows through 5.6.
  When specifying a program to elevate, it can typically be found within the Program Files (x86)
  folder and therefore uses the %ProgramFiles(x86)% environment variable. However, when this
  same policy gets pushed to a 32bit machine, this environment variable does not exist. Therefore,
  since the standard user can create a user level environment variable, they can repoint this
  variable to any folder the user has full control of. Then, the folder structure can be created
  in such a way that a rule matches and arbitrary code runs elevated.
