  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  ALSA: core: Fix NULL module pointer assignment at card init

  The commit 81033c6b584b ("ALSA: core: Warn on empty module")
  introduced a WARN_ON() for a NULL module pointer passed at snd_card
  object creation, and it also wraps the code around it with '#ifdef
  MODULE'.  This works in most cases, but the devils are always in
  details.  "MODULE" is defined when the target code (i.e. the sound
  core) is built as a module; but this doesn't mean that the caller is
  also built-in or not.  Namely, when only the sound core is built-in
  (CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a module (CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m),
  the passed module pointer is ignored even if it's non-NULL, and
  card->module remains as NULL.  This would result in the missing module
  reference up/down at the device open/close, leading to a race with the
  code execution after the module removal.

  For addressing the bug, move the assignment of card->module again out
  of ifdef.  The WARN_ON() is still wrapped with ifdef because the
  module can be really NULL when all sound drivers are built-in.

  Note that we keep 'ifdef MODULE' for WARN_ON(), otherwise it would
  lead to a false-positive NULL module check.  Admittedly it won't catch
  perfectly, i.e. no check is performed when CONFIG_SND=y.  But, it's no
  real problem as it's only for debugging, and the condition is pretty
  rare.
