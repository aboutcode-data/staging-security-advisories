summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications
  Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The
  vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management
  interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading
  a user of the web-based management interface to click a link that is designed to submit malicious
  input to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
  script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based
  information on the targeted device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg51264.'
