aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the exsltFuncResultComp() function of libxslt, which handles EXSLT
  <func:result> elements during stylesheet parsing. Due to improper type handling, the function
  may treat an XML document node as a regular XML element node, resulting in a type confusion.
  This can cause unexpected memory reads and potential crashes. While difficult to exploit,
  the flaw could lead to application instability or denial of service.
