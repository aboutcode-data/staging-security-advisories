aliases: []
summary: Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. In the Shopware CMS, the state handler
  for orders fails to sufficiently verify user authorizations for actions that modify the payment,
  delivery, and/or order status. Due to this inadequate implementation, users lacking 'write'
  permissions for orders are still able to change the order state. This issue has been addressed
  and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and
  6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of
  functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.
