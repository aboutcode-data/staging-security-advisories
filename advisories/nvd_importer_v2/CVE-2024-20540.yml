aliases: []
summary: "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center\
  \ Management Portal (Unified CCMP) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low\
  \ privileges to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\
  \n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly\
  \ validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting\
  \ malicious code into a specific page of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the\
  \ attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access\
  \ sensitive browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have\
  \ at least a Supervisor role on an affected device."
