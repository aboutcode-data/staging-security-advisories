aliases: []
summary: Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior
  to version 1.7.0, Langflow provides an API Request component that can issue arbitrary HTTP
  requests within a flow. This component takes a user-supplied URL, performs only normalization
  and basic format checks, and then sends the request using a server-side httpx client. It does
  not block private IP ranges (127[.]0[.]0[.]1, the 10/172/192 ranges) or cloud metadata endpoints
  (169[.]254[.]169[.]254), and it returns the response body as the result. Because the flow
  execution endpoints (/api/v1/run, /api/v1/run/advanced) can be invoked with just an API key,
  if an attacker can control the API Request URL in a flow, non-blind SSRF is possible—accessing
  internal resources from the server’s network context. This enables requests to, and collection
  of responses from, internal administrative endpoints, metadata services, and internal databases/services,
  leading to information disclosure and providing a foothold for further attacks. Version 1.7.0
  contains a patch for this issue.
