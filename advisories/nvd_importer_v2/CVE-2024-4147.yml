aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access control vulnerability
  allows users to delete prompts created in other organizations through ID manipulation. The
  vulnerability stems from the application's failure to validate the ownership of the prompt
  before deletion, only checking if the user has permissions to delete such resources without
  verifying if it belongs to the user's project or organization. As a result, users can remove
  prompts not owned by their organization or project, leading to legitimate users being unable
  to access the removed prompts and causing information inconsistencies.
