summary: 'Home Assistant before 2021.1.3 does not have a protection layer that can help to prevent
  directory-traversal attacks against custom integrations. NOTE: the vendor''s perspective is
  that the vulnerability itself is in custom integrations written by third parties, not in Home
  Assistant; however, Home Assistant does have a security update that is worthwhile in addressing
  this situation'
