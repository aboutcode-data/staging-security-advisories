aliases: []
summary: FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions prior to 1.8.128
  are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the /public/tools.php source file. The value of
  the php_path parameter is being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without
  validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS commands on the server. A
  practical demonstration of the successful command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd
  file of the server. This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the FreeScout
  application. This attack requires an attacker to know the `App_Key` of the application. This
  limitation makes the Attack Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`,
  the attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application is deployed. Version
  1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue.
