aliases: []
summary: ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. In versions prior to 6.5.3, the
  Database Restore functionality does not validate the content or file extension of uploaded
  files. As a result, an attacker can upload a web shell file and subsequently upload a .htaccess
  file to enable direct access to it. Once accessed, the uploaded web shell allows remote code
  execution (RCE) on the server. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue.
