summary: Shopware is an open source commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue js.
  The Administration session expiration was set to one week, when an attacker has stolen the
  session cookie they could use it for a long period of time. In version 6.4.18.1 an automatic
  logout into the Administration session has been added. As a result the user will be logged
  out when they are inactive. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for
  this issue.
