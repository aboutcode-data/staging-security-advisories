summary: The Custom Post Type plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
  custom post type deletion functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to delete custom post types via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
