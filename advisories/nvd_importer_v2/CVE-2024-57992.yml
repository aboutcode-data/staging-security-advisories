summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: wilc1000: unregister wiphy only if it has been registered

  There is a specific error path in probe functions in wilc drivers (both
  sdio and spi) which can lead to kernel panic, as this one for example
  when using SPI:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 9f000000 when read
  [9f000000] *pgd=00000000

  The issue can easily be reproduced, for example by not wiring correctly
  a wilc device through SPI (and so, make it unresponsive to early SPI
  commands). It is due to a recent change decoupling wiphy allocation from
  wiphy registration, however wilc_netdev_cleanup has not been updated
  accordingly, letting it possibly call wiphy unregister on a wiphy which
  has never been registered.

  Fix this crash by moving wiphy_unregister/wiphy_free out of
  wilc_netdev_cleanup, and by adjusting error paths in both drivers
