summary: The Ultimate Member – User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content
  Restriction & Membership Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to second-order SQL Injection
  via filenames in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.2 due to insufficient escaping on
  the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.
  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with  access to upload files and manage
  filenames through a third-party plugin like a File Manager, to append additional SQL queries
  into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
  The risk of this vulnerability is very minimal as it requires a user to be able to manipulate
  filenames in order to successfully exploit.
