summary: "On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such,\
  \ writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions\
  \ can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating\
  \ Systems.\n\nThe method File.createTempFile on unix-like systems creates a file with predefined\
  \ name (so easily identifiable) and by default will create this file with the permissions\
  \ -rw-r--r--. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can\
  \ read this information.\n\nFile.createTempFile(String, String) will create a temporary file\
  \ in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly\
  \ set. \n\nThis affects the class  https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L99\
  \  and was introduced by  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3123 \n\nIn practice,\
  \ this has a very limited impact as this class is used only if ui.disable.spout.lag.monitoring\n\
  \n is set to false, but its value is true by default.\nMoreover, the temporary file gets deleted\
  \ soon after its creation.\n\nThe solution is to use  Files.createTempFile https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...)\
  \  instead.\n\nWe recommend that all users upgrade to the latest version of Apache Storm."
