aliases: []
summary: Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. Prior to versions
  23.0.3 and 22.0.4, anyone with read/write access to the backup storage location (e.g. an S3
  bucket) can manipulate backup manifest files so that files in the manifest — which may be
  files that they have also added to the manifest and backup contents — are written to any accessible
  location on restore. This is a common path traversal security issue. This can be used to provide
  that attacker with unintended/unauthorized access to the production deployment environment
  — allowing them to access information available in that environment as well as run any additional
  arbitrary commands there. Versions 23.0.3 and 22.0.4 contain a patch. No known workarounds
  are available.
