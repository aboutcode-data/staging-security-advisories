aliases: []
summary: Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP agent.
  The function parsing the received SNMP request does not verify the input message's requested
  variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine buffer. If the number of variables
  in the request exceeds the allocated buffer, a memory write out of the buffer boundaries occurs.
  This write operation provides a possibility to overwrite other variables allocated in the
  .bss section by the application. Because the sender of the frame is in control of the content
  that will be written beyond the buffer limits, and there is no strict process memory separation,
  this issue may allow overwriting of sensitive memory areas of an IoT device.
