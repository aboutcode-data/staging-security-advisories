summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Unity Express could allow an authenticated, local
  attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. To exploit this
  vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is
  due to improper input validation for certain CLI commands that are executed on a vulnerable

  crafted CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands
  on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.
