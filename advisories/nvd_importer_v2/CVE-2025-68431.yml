aliases: []
summary: libheif is an HEIF and AVIF file format decoder and encoder. Prior to version 1.21.0,
  a crafted HEIF that exercises the overlay image item path triggers a heap buffer over-read
  in `HeifPixelImage::overlay()`. The function computes a negative row length (likely from an
  unclipped overlay rectangle or invalid offsets), which then underflows when converted to `size_t`
  and is passed to `memcpy`, causing a very large read past the end of the source plane and
  a crash. Version 1.21.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, avoid decoding images using `iovl`
  overlay boxes.
