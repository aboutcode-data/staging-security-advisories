aliases: []
summary: The Database for Contact Form 7, WPforms, Elementor forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the CSV export functionality in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to download sensitive form submission data containing personally identifiable information
  (PII) by accessing the CSV export endpoint with an export key that is exposed in publicly
  accessible page source code. The vulnerability is created because while the shortcode properly
  filters displayed entries by user, the CSV export handler completely bypasses this filtering
  and exports all entries regardless of user permissions.
