aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In the dialog.php
  page, the session variable $_SESSION['RF']["view_type"] wasn't sanitized if it was already
  set. This made stored XSS possible if one opens ajax_calls.php and uses the "view" action
  and places a payload in the type parameter, and then returns to the dialog.php page. This
  occurs because ajax_calls.php was also able to set the $_SESSION['RF']["view_type"] variable,
  but there it wasn't sanitized.
