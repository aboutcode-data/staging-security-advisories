aliases: []
summary: The Groups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
  plugin's 'groups_group_info' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.0 due to
  insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject
  arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
