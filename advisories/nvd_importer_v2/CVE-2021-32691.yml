aliases: []
summary: Apollos Apps is an open source platform for launching church-related apps. In Apollos
  Apps versions prior to 2.20.0, new user registrations are able to access anyone's account
  by only knowing their basic profile information (name, birthday, gender, etc). This includes
  all app functionality within the app, as well as any authenticated links to Rock-based webpages
  (such as giving and events). There is a patch in version 2.20.0. As a workaround, one can
  patch one's server by overriding the `create` data source method on the `People` class.
