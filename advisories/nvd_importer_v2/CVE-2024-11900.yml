summary: The Portfolio – Filterable Masonry Portfolio Gallery for Professionals plugin for WordPress
  is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'portfolio-pro' shortcode in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
  escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
  with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
  execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
