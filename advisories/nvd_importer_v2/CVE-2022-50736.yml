  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  RDMA/siw: Fix immediate work request flush to completion queue

  Correctly set send queue element opcode during immediate work request
  flushing in post sendqueue operation, if the QP is in ERROR state.
  An undefined ocode value results in out-of-bounds access to an array
  for mapping the opcode between siw internal and RDMA core representation
  in work completion generation. It resulted in a KASAN BUG report
  of type 'global-out-of-bounds' during NFSoRDMA testing.

  This patch further fixes a potential case of a malicious user which may
  write undefined values for completion queue elements status or opcode,
  if the CQ is memory mapped to user land. It avoids the same out-of-bounds
  access to arrays for status and opcode mapping as described above.
