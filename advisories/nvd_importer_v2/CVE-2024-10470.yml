aliases: []
summary: The WPLMS Learning Management System for WordPress, WordPress LMS theme for WordPress
  is vulnerable to arbitrary file read and deletion due to insufficient file path validation
  and permissions checks in the readfile and unlink functions in all versions up to, and including,
  4.962. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the
  server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such
  as wp-config.php). The theme is vulnerable even when it is not activated.
