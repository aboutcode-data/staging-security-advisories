aliases: []
summary: Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. The Shopware application API contains
  a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their
  Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters
  in the “aggregations” object. The ‘name’ field in this “aggregations” object is vulnerable
  SQL-injection and can be exploited using time-based SQL-queries.  This issue has been addressed
  and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and
  6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of
  functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.
