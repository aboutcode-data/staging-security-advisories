aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. A flaw was found
  in the Web Service, which could lead to local information disclosure. The command that creates
  the URL for the support bundle uses an insecure RNG. That can lead to prediction of the generated
  URL. As a result, an attacker can get access to system logs. An attacker would need credentials
  to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.
  Important note - This vulnerability is related to the Object First Ootbi BETA version, which
  is not released for production and therefore has no impact on the production environment.
  The production-ready Object First Ootbi version will have this vulnerability fixed.
