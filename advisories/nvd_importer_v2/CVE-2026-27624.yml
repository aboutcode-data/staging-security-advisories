summary: 'Coturn is a free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn is commonly
  configured to block loopback and internal ranges using "denied-peer-ip" and/or default loopback
  restrictions. CVE-2020-26262 addressed bypasses involving "0.0.0.0", "[::1]" and "[::]", but
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 is not covered. When sending a "CreatePermission" or "ChannelBind" request
  with the "XOR-PEER-ADDRESS" value of "::ffff:127.0.0.1", a successful response is received,
  even though "127.0.0.0/8" is blocked via "denied-peer-ip". The root cause is that, prior to
  the updated fix implemented in version 4.9.0, three functions in "src/client/ns_turn_ioaddr.c"
  do not check "IN6_IS_ADDR_V4MAPPED". "ioa_addr_is_loopback()" checks "127.x.x.x" (AF_INET)
  and "::1" (AF_INET6), but not "::ffff:127.0.0.1." "ioa_addr_is_zero()" checks "0.0.0.0" and
  "::", but not "::ffff:0.0.0.0." "addr_less_eq()" used by "ioa_addr_in_range()" for "denied-peer-ip"
  matching: when the range is AF_INET and the peer is AF_INET6, the comparison returns 0 without
  extracting the embedded IPv4. Version 4.9.0 contains an updated fix to address the bypass
  of the fix for CVE-2020-26262.'
