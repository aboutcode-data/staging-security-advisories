aliases: []
summary: OpenFGA is a high-performance authorization/permission engine inspired by Google Zanzibar.
  Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You
  are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a
  tupleset relation (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement). This issue has been patched
  in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that
  uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.
