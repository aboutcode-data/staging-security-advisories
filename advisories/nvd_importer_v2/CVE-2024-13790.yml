aliases: []
summary: The MinimogWP – The High Converting eCommerce WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is
  vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.0 via the 'template'
  parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary
  files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used
  to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where
  images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.
