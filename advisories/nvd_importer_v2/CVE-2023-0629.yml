aliases: []
summary: "Docker Desktop before 4.17.0 allows an unprivileged user to bypass Enhanced Container\
  \ Isolation (ECI) restrictions by setting the Docker host to docker.raw.sock, or npipe:////.pipe/docker_engine_linux\
  \ on Windows, via the -H (--host) CLI flag or the DOCKER_HOST environment variable and launch\
  \ containers without the additional hardening features provided by ECI. This would not affect\
  \ already running containers, nor containers launched through the usual approach (without\
  \ Docker's raw socket).\n\nThe affected functionality is available for Docker Business customers\
  \ only and assumes an environment where users are not granted local root or Administrator\
  \ privileges.\nThis issue has been fixed in Docker Desktop 4.17.0. \n\nAffected Docker Desktop\
  \ versions: from 4.13.0 before 4.17.0."
