  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  smb: client: fix missed ses refcounting

  Use new cifs_smb_ses_inc_refcount() helper to get an active reference
  of @ses and @ses->dfs_root_ses (if set).  This will prevent
  @ses->dfs_root_ses of being put in the next call to cifs_put_smb_ses()
  and thus potentially causing an use-after-free bug.
