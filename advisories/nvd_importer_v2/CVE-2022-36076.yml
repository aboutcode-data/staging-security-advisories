summary: NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or
  a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the
  first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce
  was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that
  a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another
  user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version
  1.17.2.
