summary: Quark Cloud Drive v3.23.2 has a DLL Hijacking vulnerability. This vulnerability stems
  from the insecure loading of system libraries. Specifically, the application does not validate
  the path or signature of [regsvr32.exe] it loads. An attacker can place a crafted malicious
  DLL in the application's startup directory, which will be loaded and executed when the user
  launches the program.
