datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-16884
aliases: []
summary: |
  <p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the IEToEdge Browser Helper Object (BHO) plugin on Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.</p>
  <p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
  <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the IEToEdge BHO plug-in handles objects in memory.</p>
