  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  wifi: mac80211: correctly decode TTLM with default link map

  TID-To-Link Mapping (TTLM) elements do not contain any link mapping
  presence indicator if a default mapping is used and parsing needs to be
  skipped.

  Note that access points should not explicitly report an advertised TTLM
  with a default mapping as that is the implied mapping if the element is
  not included, this is even the case when switching back to the default
  mapping. However, mac80211 would incorrectly parse the frame and would
  also read one byte beyond the end of the element.
