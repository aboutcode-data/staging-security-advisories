aliases: []
summary: 'Kirby is a content management system. The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows
  several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format.
  It also includes a "Custom" link type for advanced use cases that don''t fit any of the pre-defined
  link formats.  As the "Custom" link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript:
  URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers
  to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated
  from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is patched in 4.1.1.'
