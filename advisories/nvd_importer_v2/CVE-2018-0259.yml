summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco MATE Collector could
  allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack
  and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
  CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious
  link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted
  device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh31222.'
