aliases: []
summary: Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A potential security
  vulnerability has been discovered in `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4.
  The vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the `invitationLinkAction` function
  of the UserController, specifically in the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input.  The host header
  from incoming HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can manipulate
  the HTTP host header in requests to the /admin/user/invitationlink endpoint, resulting in
  the generation of URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact, if a host header is injected in
  the POST request, the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this unvalidated host header.
  It is then used to send an invitation email to the provided user. This vulnerability can be
  used to perform phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails point to
  an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability. The maintainers
  recommend validating the host header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It
  would also be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the incoming host header
  is not recognized or is absent.
