  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  net: dsa: ar9331: register the mdiobus under devres

  As explained in commits:
  74b6d7d13307 ("net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres")
  5135e96a3dd2 ("net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres")

  mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-
  devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus was
  not previously unregistered.

  The ar9331 is an MDIO device, so the initial set of constraints that I
  thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call ->remove on
  ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which applies here.

  If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown
  (like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link
  between the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()
  will unbind the ar9331 switch driver on shutdown.

  So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which
  is: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,
  or don't use devres at all.

  The ar9331 driver doesn't have a complex code structure for mdiobus
  removal, so just replace of_mdiobus_register with the devres variant in
  order to be all-devres and ensure that we don't free a still-registered
  bus.
