summary: Octokit is a Ruby toolkit for the GitHub API. Versions 4.23.0 and 4.24.0 of the octokit
  gem were published containing world-writeable files. Specifically, the gem was packed with
  files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e.
  0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance
  where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem.
  This issue is patched in Octokit 4.25.0. Two workarounds are available. Users can use the
  previous version of the gem, v4.22.0. Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions
  manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.
