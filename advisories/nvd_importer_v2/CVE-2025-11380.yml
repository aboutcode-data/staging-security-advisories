aliases: []
summary: The Everest Backup – WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore & Cloning Plugin plugin
  for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check
  on the 'everest_process_status' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.5. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve back-up file locations that can
  be subsequently accessed and downloaded. This does require a back-up to be running in order
  for an attacker to retrieve the back-up location.
