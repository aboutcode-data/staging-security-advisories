summary: qBit Manage is a tool that helps manage tedious tasks in qBittorrent and automate them.
  A path traversal vulnerability exists in qbit_manage's web API that allows authenticated users
  to read arbitrary files from the server filesystem through the restore_config_from_backup
  endpoint. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass directory restrictions and read arbitrary
  files from the server filesystem by manipulating the backup_id parameter with path traversal
  sequences (e.g., ../). This vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.4.
