aliases: []
summary: Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web
  application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. When submitting
  a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked
  (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general). Object-level permissions (i.e.,
  does the user have permission to run this specific Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view
  used in this case. A user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured
  JobButton Jobs. Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and 2.1.0
