aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in KaiOS 2.5 and 2.5.1. The pre-installed Contacts application
  is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. An attacker can send a vCard file
  to the victim that will inject HTML into the Contacts application (assuming the victim chooses
  to import the file). At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Contacts
  application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials
  such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker
  to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.
