summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  NFSD: Define actions for the new time_deleg FATTR4 attributes

  NFSv4 clients won't send legitimate GETATTR requests for these new
  attributes because they are intended to be used only with CB_GETATTR
  and SETATTR. But NFSD has to do something besides crashing if it
  ever sees a GETATTR request that queries these attributes.

  RFC 8881 Section 18.7.3 states:

  > The server MUST return a value for each attribute that the client
  > requests if the attribute is supported by the server for the
  > target file system. If the server does not support a particular
  > attribute on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the
  > attribute value and MUST NOT set the attribute bit in the result
  > bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an
  > attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case,
  > no attribute values will be returned.

  Further, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:

  > These new attributes are invalid to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY,
  > and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR
  > by a client holding an appropriate delegation.

  Thus there does not appear to be a specific server response mandated
  by specification. Taking the guidance that querying these attributes
  via GETATTR is "invalid", NFSD will return nfserr_inval, failing the
  request entirely.
