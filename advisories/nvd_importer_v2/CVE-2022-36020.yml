aliases: []
summary: The typo3/html-sanitizer package is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide
  XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Due to a parsing
  issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with
  special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a bypass of the cross-site
  scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7
  and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
  no known workarounds for this issue.
