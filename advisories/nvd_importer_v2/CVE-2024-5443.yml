summary: CVE-2024-4320 describes a vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms software, specifically
  within the `ExtensionBuilder().build_extension()` function. The vulnerability arises from
  the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate
  beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder`
  parameters accepting empty strings (`""`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can
  lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently,
  if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended
  to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory,
  leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has
  been addressed in version 9.8.
