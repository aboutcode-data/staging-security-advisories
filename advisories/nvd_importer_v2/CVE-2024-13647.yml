summary: The School Management System – SakolaWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect

  it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update exam settings via a forged request granted
  they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
