aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Espressif ESP-IDF 2.x, 3.0.x through 3.0.9, 3.1.x through
  3.1.6, 3.2.x through 3.2.3, and 3.3.x through 3.3.1. An attacker who uses fault injection
  to physically disrupt the ESP32 CPU can bypass the Secure Boot digest verification at startup,
  and boot unverified code from flash. The fault injection attack does not disable the Flash
  Encryption feature, so if the ESP32 is configured with the recommended combination of Secure
  Boot and Flash Encryption, then the impact is minimized. If the ESP32 is configured without
  Flash Encryption then successful fault injection allows arbitrary code execution. To protect
  devices with Flash Encryption and Secure Boot enabled against this attack, a firmware change
  must be made to permanently enable Flash Encryption in the field if it is not already permanently
  enabled.
