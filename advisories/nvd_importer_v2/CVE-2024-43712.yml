summary: Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.21 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the
  context of the victim's browser. This issue occurs when data from a user-controllable source
  is improperly sanitized before being used in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page,
  leading to the execution of malicious scripts. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction,
  such as tricking a victim into clicking a link or navigating to a malicious website.
