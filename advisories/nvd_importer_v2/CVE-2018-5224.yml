aliases: []
summary: Bamboo did not correctly check if a configured Mercurial repository URI contained values
  that the Windows operating system may consider argument parameters. An attacker who has permission
  to create a repository in Bamboo, edit an existing plan in Bamboo that has a non-linked Mercurial
  repository, or create a plan in Bamboo either globally or in a project using Bamboo Specs
  can can execute code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo on
  the Windows operating system. All versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.3.3 (the
  fixed version for 6.3.x) and from version 6.4.0 before 6.4.1 (the fixed version for 6.4.x)
  running on the Windows operating system are affected by this vulnerability.
