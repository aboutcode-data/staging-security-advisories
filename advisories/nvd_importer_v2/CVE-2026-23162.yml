  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  drm/xe/nvm: Fix double-free on aux add failure

  After a successful auxiliary_device_init(), aux_dev->dev.release
  (xe_nvm_release_dev()) is responsible for the kfree(nvm). When
  there is failure with auxiliary_device_add(), driver will call
  auxiliary_device_uninit(), which call put_device(). So that the
  .release callback will be triggered to free the memory associated
  with the auxiliary_device.

  Move the kfree(nvm) into the auxiliary_device_init() failure path
  and remove the err goto path to fix below error.
