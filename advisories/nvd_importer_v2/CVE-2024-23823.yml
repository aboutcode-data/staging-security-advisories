summary: vantage6 is an open source framework built to enable, manage and deploy privacy enhancing
  technologies like Federated Learning and Multi-Party Computation. The vantage6 server has
  no restrictions on CORS settings. It should be possible for people to set the allowed origins
  of the server.  The impact is limited because v6 does not use session cookies. This issue
  has been addressed in commit `70bb4e1d8` and is expected to ship in subsequent releases. Users
  are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no known workarounds
  for this vulnerability.
