summary: The WordPress Mega Menu – QuadMenu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the ajax_dismiss_notice() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
  attackers to update any user meta to a value of one, including wp_capabilities which could
  result in a privilege deescalation of an administrator, via a forged request granted they
  can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
