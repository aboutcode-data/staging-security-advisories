aliases: []
summary: The Bucketlister plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the plugin's
  shortcode `category` and `id` attributes in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.5 due to
  insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameters and lack of sufficient preparation on
  the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level
  access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can
  be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
