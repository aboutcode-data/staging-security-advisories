  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  firmware: arm_ffa: Fix FFA device names for logical partitions

  Each physical partition can provide multiple services each with UUID.
  Each such service can be presented as logical partition with a unique
  combination of VM ID and UUID. The number of distinct UUID in a system
  will be less than or equal to the number of logical partitions.

  However, currently it fails to register more than one logical partition
  or service within a physical partition as the device name contains only
  VM ID while both VM ID and UUID are maintained in the partition information.
  The kernel complains with the below message:

    | sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/arm-ffa-8001'

  By virtue of being random enough to avoid collisions when generated in a
  distributed system, there is no way to compress UUID keys to the number
  of bits required to identify each. We can eliminate '-' in the name but
  it is not worth eliminating 4 bytes and add unnecessary logic for doing
  that. Also v1.0 doesn't provide the UUID of the partitions which makes
  it hard to use the same for the device name.

  So to keep it simple, let us alloc an ID using ida_alloc() and append the
  same to "arm-ffa" to make up a unique device name. Also stash the id value
  in ffa_dev to help freeing the ID later when the device is destroyed.
