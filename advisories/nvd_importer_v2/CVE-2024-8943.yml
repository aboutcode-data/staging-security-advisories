aliases: []
summary: The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions
  up to, and including,  5.0.12. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being
  supplied during the booking customer step. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access
  to the user id. Note that logging in as a WordPress user is only possible if the "Use WordPress
  users as customers" setting is enabled, which is disabled by default. The vulnerability is
  partially patched in version 5.0.12 and fully patched in version 5.0.13.
