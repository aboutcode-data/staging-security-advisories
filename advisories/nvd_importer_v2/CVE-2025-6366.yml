aliases: []
summary: The Event List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions
  up to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's capabilities
  prior to updating their profile in the el_update_profile() function. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change their capabilities
  to those of an administrator.
