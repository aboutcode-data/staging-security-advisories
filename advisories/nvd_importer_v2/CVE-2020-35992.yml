summary: Fiserv Prologue through 2020-12-16 does not properly protect the database password.
  If an attacker were to gain access to the configuration file (specifically, the LogPassword
  attribute within appconfig.ini), they would be able to decrypt the password stored within
  the configuration file. This would yield cleartext credentials for the database (to gain access
  to financial records of customers stored within the database), and in some cases would allow
  remote login to the database.
