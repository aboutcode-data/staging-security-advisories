  1000V Series when configured with IPv6. In the field and internal testing, this vulnerability
  was only observed or reproduced on the Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Router. The Cisco ASR
  1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series contain
  the same code logic, so affected trains have had the code fix applied; however, on these two
  products, the vulnerability has not been observed in the field or successfully reproduced
  internally. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd75185.'
