aliases: []
summary: A container privilege escalation flaw was found in certain Container-native Virtualization
  images. This issue stems from the /etc/passwd file being created with group-writable permissions
  during build time. In certain conditions, an attacker who can execute commands within an affected
  container, even as a non-root user, can leverage their membership in the root group to modify
  the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID,
  including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.
