aliases: []
summary: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (pfcpiface component)
  in version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. When the UPF receives a PFCP Session Report Response
  that is missing the mandatory Cause Information Element, the session report handler dereferences
  a nil pointer instead of rejecting the malformed message. This triggers a panic and terminates
  the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Session Report Response messages to the UPF's
  N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this flaw to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane
  services.
