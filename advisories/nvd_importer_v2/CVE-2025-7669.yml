aliases: []
summary: The Avishi WP PayPal Payment Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect
  nonce validation on the 'avishi-wp-paypal-payment-button/index.php' page. This makes it possible
  for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged
  request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking
  on a link.
