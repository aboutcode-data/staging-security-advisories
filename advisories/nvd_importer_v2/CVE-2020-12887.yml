aliases: []
summary: Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3 when using the
  Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets.
  The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP option number field of all options
  present in the input packet. Each option number is calculated as a sum of the previous option
  number and a delta of the current option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed
  as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow detection, it is possible to craft a
  packet that wraps the option number around and results in the same option number being processed
  again in a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation function.
  In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH, COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY, and
  COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on whether memory has already been allocated, which in
  conjunction with the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of allocated
  memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning.
  As a result, the memory is never freed.
