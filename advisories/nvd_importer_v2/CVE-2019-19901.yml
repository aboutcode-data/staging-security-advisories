aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.13.x before 1.13.5 and 1.14.x before 1.14.2.
  It doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying certain block descriptions created by
  administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized description, then have an
  administrator execute scripting when configuring a layout, aka XSS. This issue is mitigated
  by the fact that the attacker would be required to have the permission to create custom blocks,
  which is typically an administrative task.
