summary: "A vulnerability in the Virtual Keyboard Video Monitor (vKVM) connection handling of\
  \ Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker\
  \ with low privileges to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user\
  \ of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied\
  \ input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit\
  \ this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific data field in the interface.\
  \ A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context\
  \ of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this\
  \ vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials with privileges that allow\
  \ for vKVM access on the affected device.\r\nNote: The affected vKVM client is also included\
  \ in Cisco UCS Manager."
