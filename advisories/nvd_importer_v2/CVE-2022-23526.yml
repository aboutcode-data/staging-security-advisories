aliases: []
summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts, pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Versions prior
  to 3.10.3 are subject to NULL Pointer Dereference in the_chartutil_ package that can cause
  a segmentation violation. The _chartutil_ package contains a parser that loads a JSON Schema
  validation file. For example, the Helm client when rendering a chart will validate its values
  with the schema file. The _chartutil_ package parses the schema file and loads it into structures
  Go can work with. Some schema files can cause array data structures to be created causing
  a memory violation. Applications that use the _chartutil_ package in the Helm SDK to parse
  a schema file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be
  recovered from. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses
  of the Helm client. This issue has been patched in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate schema files
  that are correctly formatted before passing them to the _chartutil_ functions.
