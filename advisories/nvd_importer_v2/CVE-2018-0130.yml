summary: 'A vulnerability in the use of JSON web tokens by the web-based service portal of Cisco
  Elastic Services Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain
  administrative access to an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the presence of static
  default credentials for the web-based service portal of the affected software. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by extracting the credentials from an image of the affected
  software and using those credentials to generate a valid administrative session token for
  the web-based service portal of any other installation of the affected software. A successful
  exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based service portal
  of an affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software
  Release 3.0.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg30884.'
