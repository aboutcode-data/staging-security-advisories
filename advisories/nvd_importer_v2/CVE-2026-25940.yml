aliases: []
summary: jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.2.0, user control of
  properties and methods of the Acroform module allows users to inject arbitrary PDF objects,
  such as JavaScript actions. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized input to one of the
  following property, a user can inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions, which
  are executed when the victim hovers over the radio option. The vulnerability has been fixed
  in jsPDF@4.2.0. As a workaround, sanitize user input before passing it to the vulnerable API
  members.
