aliases: []
summary: The Rabbit Hole plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in
  all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the plugin's reset functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
  to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
  into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The vulnerability is exacerbated by
  the fact that the reset operation is performed via a GET request, making exploitation trivial
  via image tags or hyperlinks.
