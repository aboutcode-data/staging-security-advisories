aliases: []
summary: The Greenshift – animation and page builder blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
  to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Server-Side Request Forgery and Stored Cross Site Scripting
  in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.0 due to a missing capability check in the greenshift_download_file_localy
  function, along with no SSRF protection and sanitization on uploaded SVG files. This makes
  it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to make web
  requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application that can also be leveraged
  to download malicious SVG files containing Cross-Site Scripting payloads to the server. On
  Cloud-based servers, attackers could retrieve the instance metadata. The issue was partially
  patched in version 8.9.9 and fully patched in version 9.0.1.
