aliases: []
summary: In RUCKUS Network Director (RND) < 4.5.0.56, the OVA appliance contains hardcoded SSH
  keys for the postgres user. These keys are identical across all deployments, allowing an attacker
  with network access to authenticate via SSH without a password. Once authenticated, the attacker
  can access the PostgreSQL database with superuser privileges, create administrative users
  for the web interface, and potentially escalate privileges further.
