  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  nfsd: check that server is running in unlock_filesystem

  If we are trying to unlock the filesystem via an administrative
  interface and nfsd isn't running, it crashes the server. This
  happens currently because nfsd4_revoke_states() access state
  structures (eg., conf_id_hashtbl) that has been freed as a part
  of the server shutdown.

  [   59.469138]  el0t_64_sync+0x1ac/0x1b0

  Ensure this can't happen by taking the nfsd_mutex and checking that
  the server is still up, and then holding the mutex across the call to
  nfsd4_revoke_states().
