aliases: []
summary: After the Android platform is added to Cordova the first time, or after a project is
  created using the build scripts, the scripts will fetch Gradle on the first build. However,
  since the default URI is not using https, it is vulnerable to a MiTM and the Gradle executable
  is not safe. The severity of this issue is high due to the fact that the build scripts immediately
  start a build after Gradle has been fetched. Developers who are concerned about this issue
  should install version 6.1.2 or higher of Cordova-Android. If developers are unable to install
  the latest version, this vulnerability can easily be mitigated by setting the CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL
  environment variable to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
