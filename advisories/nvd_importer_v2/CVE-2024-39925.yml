aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. It lacks an
  offboarding process for members who leave an organization. As a result, the shared organization
  key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access
  should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails
  to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated
  user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user
  is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding
  organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already
  possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data.
