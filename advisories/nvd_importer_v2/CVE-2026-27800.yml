aliases: []
summary: Zed, a code editor, has a Zip Slip (Path Traversal) vulnerability exists in its extension
  archive extraction functionality prior to version 0.224.4. The `extract_zip()` function in
  `crates/util/src/archive.rs` fails to validate ZIP entry filenames for path traversal sequences
  (e.g., `../`). This allows a malicious extension to write files outside its designated sandbox
  directory by downloading and extracting a crafted ZIP archive. Version 0.224.4 fixes the issue.
