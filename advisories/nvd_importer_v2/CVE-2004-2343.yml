summary: 'Apache HTTP Server 2.0.47 and earlier allows local users to bypass .htaccess file
  restrictions, as specified in httpd.conf with directives such as Deny From All, by using an
  ErrorDocument directive. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, since the .htaccess mechanism
  is only intended to restrict external web access, and a local user already has the privileges
  to perform the same operations without using ErrorDocument'
