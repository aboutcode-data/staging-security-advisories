  staging: vt6655: fix potential memory leak

  In function device_init_td0_ring, memory is allocated for member
  td_info of priv->apTD0Rings[i], with i increasing from 0. In case of
  allocation failure, the memory is freed in reversed order, with i
  decreasing to 0. However, the case i=0 is left out and thus memory is
  leaked.

  Modify the memory freeing loop to include the case i=0.
