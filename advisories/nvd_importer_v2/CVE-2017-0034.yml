aliases: []
summary: A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses
  objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that enables an attacker
  to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully
  exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current
  user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected
  system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new
  accounts with full user rights.
