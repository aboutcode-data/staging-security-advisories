  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  uacce: ensure safe queue release with state management

  Directly calling `put_queue` carries risks since it cannot
  guarantee that resources of `uacce_queue` have been fully released
  beforehand. So adding a `stop_queue` operation for the
  UACCE_CMD_PUT_Q command and leaving the `put_queue` operation to
  the final resource release ensures safety.

  Queue states are defined as follows:
  - UACCE_Q_ZOMBIE: Initial state
  - UACCE_Q_INIT: After opening `uacce`
  - UACCE_Q_STARTED: After `start` is issued via `ioctl`

  When executing `poweroff -f` in virt while accelerator are still
  working, `uacce_fops_release` and `uacce_remove` may execute
  concurrently. This can cause `uacce_put_queue` within
  `uacce_fops_release` to access a NULL `ops` pointer. Therefore, add
  state checks to prevent accessing freed pointers.
