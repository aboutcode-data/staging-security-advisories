  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb

  This reverts commit 98921dbd00c4e ("Bluetooth: Use devm_kzalloc in
  btusb.c file").

  In btusb_probe(), we use devm_kzalloc() to allocate the btusb data. This
  ties the lifetime of all the btusb data to the binding of a driver to
  one interface, INTF. In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC
  and DIAG, this is an accident waiting to happen.

  The issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where calling
  usb_driver_release_interface(&btusb_driver, data->intf) will have devm
  free the data that is also being used by the other interfaces of the
  driver that may not be released yet.

  To fix this, revert the use of devm and go back to freeing memory
  explicitly.
