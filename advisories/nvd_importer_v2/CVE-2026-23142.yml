  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  mm/damon/sysfs-scheme: cleanup access_pattern subdirs on scheme dir setup failure

  When a DAMOS-scheme DAMON sysfs directory setup fails after setup of
  access_pattern/ directory, subdirectories of access_pattern/ directory are
  not cleaned up.  As a result, DAMON sysfs interface is nearly broken until
  the system reboots, and the memory for the unremoved directory is leaked.

  Cleanup the directories under such failures.
