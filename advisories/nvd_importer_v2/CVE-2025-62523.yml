aliases: []
summary: 'PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton.
  PILOS before 4.8.0 includes a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration in its
  middleware: it reflects the Origin request header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin
  response header without proper validation or a whitelist, while Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
  is set to true. This behavior could allow a malicious website on a different origin to send
  requests (including credentials) to the PILOS API. This may enable exfiltration or actions
  using the victim’s credentials if the server accepts those cross-origin requests as authenticated.
  Laravel’s session handling applies additional origin checks such that cross-origin requests
  are not authenticated by default. Because of these session-origin protections, and in the
  absence of any other unknown vulnerabilities that would bypass Laravel’s origin/session checks,
  this reflected-Origin CORS misconfiguration is not believed to be exploitable in typical PILOS
  deployments. This vulnerability has been patched in PILOS in v4.8.0'
