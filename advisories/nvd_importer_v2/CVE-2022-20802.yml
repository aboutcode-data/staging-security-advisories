summary: A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could
  allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
  a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied
  input that is processed by the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow
  the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface or access sensitive,
  browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need
  valid agent credentials.
