aliases: []
summary: The Ovic Responsive WPBakery WordPress plugin before 1.2.9 does not limit which options
  can be updated via some of its AJAX actions, which may allow attackers with a subscriber+
  account to update blog options, such as 'users_can_register' and 'default_role'. It also unserializes
  user input in the process, which may lead to Object Injection attacks.
