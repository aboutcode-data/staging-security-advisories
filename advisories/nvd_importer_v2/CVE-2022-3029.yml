aliases: []
summary: In NLnet Labs Routinator 0.9.0 up to and including 0.11.2, due to a mistake in error
  handling, data in RRDP snapshot and delta files that isn’t correctly base 64 encoded is treated
  as a fatal error and causes Routinator to exit. Worst case impact of this vulnerability is
  denial of service for the RPKI data that Routinator provides to routers. This may stop your
  network from validating route origins based on RPKI data. This vulnerability does not allow
  an attacker to manipulate RPKI data.
