aliases: []
summary: The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  via the 'order_mail' setting in versions up to, and including, 2.11.22. This is due to insufficient
  sanitization on the order_mail field and a lack of escaping on output. This makes it possible
  for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
  web scripts via the General Setting page that will execute when an administrator accesses
  the E-mail Setting page.
