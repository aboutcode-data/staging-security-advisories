aliases: []
summary: Ibexa RichText Field Type is a Field Type for supporting rich formatted text stored
  in a structured XML format. In versions on the 4.6 branch prior to 4.6.10, the validator for
  the RichText fieldtype blocklists `javascript:` and `vbscript:` in links to prevent XSS. This
  can leave other options open, and the check can be circumvented using upper case. Content
  editing permissions for RichText content is required to exploit this vulnerability, which
  typically means Editor role or higher. The fix implements an allowlist instead, which allows
  only approved link protocols. The new check is case insensitive. Version 4.6.10 contains a
  patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.
