  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  s390: Disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP

  As reported by Luiz Capitulino enabling HVO on s390 leads to reproducible
  crashes. The problem is that kernel page tables are modified without
  flushing corresponding TLB entries.

  Even if it looks like the empty flush_tlb_all() implementation on s390 is
  the problem, it is actually a different problem: on s390 it is not allowed
  to replace an active/valid page table entry with another valid page table
  entry without the detour over an invalid entry. A direct replacement may
  lead to random crashes and/or data corruption.

  In order to invalidate an entry special instructions have to be used
  (e.g. ipte or idte). Alternatively there are also special instructions
  available which allow to replace a valid entry with a different valid
  entry (e.g. crdte or cspg).

  Given that the HVO code currently does not provide the hooks to allow for
  an implementation which is compliant with the s390 architecture
  requirements, disable ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_HUGETLB_VMEMMAP again, which is
  basically a revert of the original patch which enabled it.
