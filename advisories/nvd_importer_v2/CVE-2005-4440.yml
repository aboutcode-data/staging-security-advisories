aliases: []
summary: The 802.1q VLAN protocol allows remote attackers to bypass network segmentation and
  spoof VLAN traffic via a message with two 802.1q tags, which causes the second tag to be redirected
  from a downstream switch after the first tag has been stripped, as demonstrated by Yersinia,
  aka "double-tagging VLAN jumping attack."
