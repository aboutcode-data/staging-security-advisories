aliases: []
summary: eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook for research labs. In an eLabFTW
  system, one can configure who is allowed to create new user accounts. A vulnerability has
  been found starting in version 4.4.0 and prior to version 5.0.0 that allows regular users
  to create new, validated accounts in their team. If the system has anonymous access enabled
  (disabled by default) an unauthenticated user can create regular users in any team. This vulnerability
  has been fixed since version 5.0.0, released on February 17th 2024. Some workarounds are available.
  Disabling both options that allow *administrators* to create users will provide a mitigation.
  Additionally, disabling anonymous user access will stop anonymous access (including using
  existing access keys).
