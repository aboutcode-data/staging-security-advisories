aliases: []
summary: Pyrofork is a modern, asynchronous MTProto API framework. Versions 2.3.68 and earlier
  do not properly sanitize filenames received from Telegram messages in the download_media method
  before using them in file path construction. When downloading media, if the user does not
  specify a custom filename (which is the common/default usage), the method falls back to using
  the file_name attribute from the media object. The attribute originates from Telegram's DocumentAttributeFilename
  and is controlled by the message sender. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.69.
