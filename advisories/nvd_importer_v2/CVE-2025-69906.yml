summary: Monstra CMS v3.0.4 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Files Manager
  plugin. The application relies on blacklist-based file extension validation and stores uploaded
  files directly in a web-accessible directory. Under typical server configurations, this can
  allow an attacker to upload files that are interpreted as executable code, resulting in remote
  code execution.
