aliases: []
summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise
  Chat and Email could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software.
  The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based
  management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
  either by injecting malicious code in a chat window or by sending a crafted link to a user
  of the interface. In both cases, the attacker must persuade the user to click the crafted
  link or open the chat window that contains the attacker's code. A successful exploit could
  allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface
  or access sensitive, browser-based information. Version 11.6(1) is affected.
