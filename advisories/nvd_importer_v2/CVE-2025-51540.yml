aliases: []
summary: 'EzGED3 3.5.0 stores user passwords using an insecure hashing scheme: md5(md5(password)).
  This hashing method is cryptographically weak and allows attackers to perform efficient offline
  brute-force attacks if password hashes are disclosed. The lack of salting and use of a fast,
  outdated algorithm makes it feasible to recover plaintext credentials using precomputed tables
  or GPU-based cracking tools. The vendor states that the issue is fixed in 3.5.72.27183.'
