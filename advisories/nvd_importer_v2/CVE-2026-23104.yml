  ice: fix devlink reload call trace

  Commit 4da71a77fc3b ("ice: read internal temperature sensor") introduced
  internal temperature sensor reading via HWMON. ice_hwmon_init() was added
  to ice_init_feature() and ice_hwmon_exit() was added to ice_remove(). As a
  result if devlink reload is used to reinit the device and then the driver
  is removed, a call trace can occur.

  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc0fd4b5d
  Call Trace:
   string+0x48/0xe0
   vsnprintf+0x1f9/0x650
   sprintf+0x62/0x80
   name_show+0x1f/0x30
   dev_attr_show+0x19/0x60

  The call trace repeats approximately every 10 minutes when system
  monitoring tools (e.g., sadc) attempt to read the orphaned hwmon sysfs
  attributes that reference freed module memory.

  The sequence is:
  1. Driver load, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from ice_init_feature()
  2. Devlink reload down, flow does not call ice_remove()
  3. Devlink reload up, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from
     ice_init_feature() resulting in a second instance
  4. Driver unload, ice_hwmon_exit() called from ice_remove() leaving the
     first hwmon instance orphaned with dangling pointer

  Fix this by moving ice_hwmon_exit() from ice_remove() to
  ice_deinit_features() to ensure proper cleanup symmetry with
  ice_hwmon_init().
