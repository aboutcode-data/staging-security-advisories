aliases: []
summary: FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system.
  Prior to version 1.5.10.15, due to a lack of request sanitization in the logs, a malicious
  request containing XSS would be stored in a log file. When an administrator of the FOG server
  logged in and viewed the logs, they would be parsed as HTML and displayed accordingly. Version
  1.5.10.15 contains a patch. As a workaround, view logs from an external text editor rather
  than the dashboard.
