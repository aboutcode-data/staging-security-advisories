  Bluetooth: avoid hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() in mgmt_init_hdev()

  syzbot is again reporting attempt to cancel uninitialized work
  at mgmt_index_removed() [1], for setting of HCI_MGMT flag from
  mgmt_init_hdev() from hci_mgmt_cmd() from hci_sock_sendmsg() can
  race with testing of HCI_MGMT flag from mgmt_index_removed() from
  hci_sock_bind() due to lack of serialization via hci_dev_lock().

  Since mgmt_init_hdev() is called with mgmt_chan_list_lock held, we can
  safely split hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() into hci_dev_test_flag() and
  hci_dev_set_flag(). Thus, in order to close this race, set HCI_MGMT flag
  after INIT_DELAYED_WORK() completed.

  This is a local fix based on mgmt_chan_list_lock. Lack of serialization
  via hci_dev_lock() might be causing different race conditions somewhere
  else. But a global fix based on hci_dev_lock() should deserve a future
  patch.
