summary: The Enqueue Anything WordPress plugin through 1.0.1 does not have authorisation and
  CSRF checks in the remove_asset AJAX action, and does not ensure that the item to be deleted
  is actually an asset. As a result, low privilege users such as subscriber could delete arbitrary
  assets, as well as put arbitrary posts in the trash.
