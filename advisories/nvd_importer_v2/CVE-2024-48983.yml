aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets, the software
  dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet header.
  A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as
  the length of the packet body determined earlier plus the header length. WsfMsgAlloc then
  increments this again by sizeof(wsfMsg_t). This may cause an integer overflow that results
  in the buffer being significantly too small to contain the entire packet. This may cause a
  buffer overflow of up to 65 KB . This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but
  can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.
