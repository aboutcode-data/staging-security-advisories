summary: Tendermint before versions 0.33.3, 0.32.10, and 0.31.12 has a denial-of-service vulnerability.
  Tendermint does not limit the number of P2P connection requests. For each p2p connection,
  it allocates XXX bytes. Even though this memory is garbage collected once the connection is
  terminated (due to duplicate IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary
  memory spikes can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions. Additionally, Tendermint does not
  reclaim activeID of a peer after it's removed in Mempool reactor. This does not happen all
  the time. It only happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created
  and added to all reactors. RemovePeer is therefore called before AddPeer, which leads to always
  growing memory (activeIDs map). The activeIDs map has a maximum size of 65535 and the node
  will panic if this map reaches the maximum. An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts
  (exploiting above denial of service), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking. These
  issues are patched in Tendermint 0.33.3 and 0.32.10.
