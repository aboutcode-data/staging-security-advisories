aliases: []
summary: U.S. Air Force Sensor Data Management System extract75 has a buffer overflow that leads
  to code execution. An overflow in a global variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where
  outcome. Writing beyond sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer
  such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one achieves an arbitrary write
  when its fields are assigned. The data written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in
  the form of an integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.
