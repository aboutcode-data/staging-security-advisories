aliases: []
summary: Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things
  devices. It is possible to cause an out-of-bounds write in versions of Contiki-NG prior to
  4.6 when transmitting a 6LoWPAN packet with a chain of extension headers. Unfortunately, the
  written header is not checked to be within the available space, thereby making it possible
  to write outside the buffer. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply
  the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround.
