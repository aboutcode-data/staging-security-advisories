summary: |
  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  crypto: marvell/octeontx - prevent integer overflows

  The "code_length" value comes from the firmware file.  If your firmware
  is untrusted realistically there is probably very little you can do to
  protect yourself.  Still we try to limit the damage as much as possible.
  Also Smatch marks any data read from the filesystem as untrusted and
  prints warnings if it not capped correctly.

  The "code_length * 2" can overflow.  The round_up(ucode_size, 16) +
  sizeof() expression can overflow too.  Prevent these overflows.
