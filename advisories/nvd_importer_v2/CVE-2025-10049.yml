summary: The Responsive Filterable Portfolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
  file uploads due to missing file type validation via the HdnMediaSelection_image field in

  with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's
  server which may make remote code execution possible.
