  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  x86/sgx: Prevent attempts to reclaim poisoned pages

  TL;DR: SGX page reclaim touches the page to copy its contents to
  secondary storage. SGX instructions do not gracefully handle machine
  checks. Despite this, the existing SGX code will try to reclaim pages
  that it _knows_ are poisoned. Avoid even trying to reclaim poisoned pages.

  The longer story:

  Pages used by an enclave only get epc_page->poison set in
  arch_memory_failure() but they currently stay on sgx_active_page_list until
  sgx_encl_release(), with the SGX_EPC_PAGE_RECLAIMER_TRACKED flag untouched.

  epc_page->poison is not checked in the reclaimer logic meaning that, if other
  conditions are met, an attempt will be made to reclaim an EPC page that was
  poisoned.  This is bad because 1. we don't want that page to end up added
  to another enclave and 2. it is likely to cause one core to shut down
  and the kernel to panic.

  Specifically, reclaiming uses microcode operations including "EWB" which
  accesses the EPC page contents to encrypt and write them out to non-SGX
  memory.  Those operations cannot handle MCEs in their accesses other than
  by putting the executing core into a special shutdown state (affecting
  both threads with HT.)  The kernel will subsequently panic on the
  remaining cores seeing the core didn't enter MCE handler(s) in time.

  Call sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() to remove the affected EPC page from
  sgx_active_page_list on memory error to stop it being considered for
  reclaiming.

  Testing epc_page->poison in sgx_reclaim_pages() would also work but I assume
  it's better to add code in the less likely paths.

  The affected EPC page is not added to &node->sgx_poison_page_list until
  later in sgx_encl_release()->sgx_free_epc_page() when it is EREMOVEd.
  Membership on other lists doesn't change to avoid changing any of the
  lists' semantics except for sgx_active_page_list.  There's a "TBD" comment
  in arch_memory_failure() about pre-emptive actions, the goal here is not
  to address everything that it may imply.

  This also doesn't completely close the time window when a memory error
  notification will be fatal (for a not previously poisoned EPC page) --
  the MCE can happen after sgx_reclaim_pages() has selected its candidates
  or even *inside* a microcode operation (actually easy to trigger due to
  the amount of time spent in them.)

  The spinlock in sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() is safe because
  memory_failure() runs in process context and no spinlocks are held,
  explicitly noted in a mm/memory-failure.c comment.
