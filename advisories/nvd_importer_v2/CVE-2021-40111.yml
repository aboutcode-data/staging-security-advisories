aliases: []
summary: In Apache James, while fuzzing with Jazzer the IMAP parsing stack, we discover that
  crafted APPEND and STATUS IMAP command could be used to trigger infinite loops resulting in
  expensive CPU computations and OutOfMemory exceptions. This can be used for a Denial Of Service
  attack. The IMAP user needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. This affected
  Apache James prior to version 3.6.1. This vulnerability had been patched in Apache James 3.6.1
  and higher. We recommend the upgrade.
