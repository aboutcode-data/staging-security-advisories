aliases: []
summary: Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13, a critical
  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint.
  This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any
  URL they choose. Consequently, internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider
  metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side
  via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation, nor are there any allow-list,
  timeout, or size restrictions. Because of this, attackers can point the application at internal
  targets. Using this flaw, an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive
  cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.
