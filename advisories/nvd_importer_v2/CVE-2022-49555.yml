  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

  Bluetooth: hci_qca: Use del_timer_sync() before freeing

  While looking at a crash report on a timer list being corrupted, which
  usually happens when a timer is freed while still active. This is
  commonly triggered by code calling del_timer() instead of
  del_timer_sync() just before freeing.

  One possible culprit is the hci_qca driver, which does exactly that.

  Eric mentioned that wake_retrans_timer could be rearmed via the work
  queue, so also move the destruction of the work queue before
  del_timer_sync().
