aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Prime Network Registrar (CPNR)
  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections in
  the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted
  user, with an active administrative session on the affected device, to click a malicious link.
  A successful exploit could allow an attacker to change the device's configuration, which could
  include the ability to edit or create user accounts of any privilege level. Some changes to
  the device's configuration could negatively impact the availability of networking services
  for other devices on networks managed by CPNR.
