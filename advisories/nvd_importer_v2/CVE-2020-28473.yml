aliases: []
summary: The package bottle from 0 and before 0.12.19 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning
  by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters
  using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between
  the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious
  requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon
  as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.
