aliases: []
summary: Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress by LiquidThemes are vulnerable to unauthorized
  access due to a missing capability check on the liquid_reset_wordpress_before AJAX in various
  versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access
  and above, to deactivate all of a site's plugins. While we escalated this to Envato after
  not being able to establish contact, it appears the developer added a nonce check, however
  that is not sufficient protection as the nonce is exposed to all users with access to the
  dashboard.
