aliases: []
summary: Puma is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9,
  using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character
  could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing
  the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which has this
  behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses
  persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy
  may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and
  when processing the second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect. If
  the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different
  client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the second client. This
  vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9. As a workaround, do not use Apache Traffic
  Server with `puma`.
