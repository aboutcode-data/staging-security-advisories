aliases: []
summary: Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create
  configurations such as "Better-Audit-Logging" which contain a channel from another server
  as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass
  raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and
  mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no
  known workarounds.
