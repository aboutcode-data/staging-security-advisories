aliases: []
summary: Snowflake, a platform for using artificial intelligence in the context of cloud computing,
  has a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC driver ("Driver") in versions 3.0.13 through 3.23.0
  of the driver. When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would log locally the client-side
  encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key
  by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations,  and
  is not logged server-side by Snowflake. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1.
