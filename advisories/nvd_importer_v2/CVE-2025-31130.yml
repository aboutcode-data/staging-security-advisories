datasource_url: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31130
aliases: []
summary: gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust. Before 0.42.0, gitoxide uses
  SHA-1 hash implementations without any collision detection, leaving it vulnerable to hash
  collision attacks. gitoxide uses the sha1_smol or sha1 crate, both of which implement standard
  SHA-1 without any mitigations for collision attacks. This means that two distinct Git objects
  with colliding SHA-1 hashes would break the Git object model and integrity checks when used
  with gitoxide. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.42.0.
