summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting
  in version 9.12.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, Directus Flows with a manual trigger are not
  validating whether the user triggering the Flow has permissions to the items provided as payload
  to the Flow. Depending on what the Flow is set up to do this can lead to the Flow executing
  potential tasks on the attacker's behalf without authenticating. Bad actors could execute
  the manual trigger Flows without authentication, or access rights to the said collection(s)
  or item(s). Users with manual trigger Flows configured are impacted as these endpoints do
  not currently validate if the user has read access to `directus_flows` or to the relevant
  collection/items. The manual trigger Flows should have tighter security requirements as compared
  to webhook Flows where users are expected to perform do their own checks. Version 11.9.0 fixes
  the issue. As a workaround, implement permission checks for read access to Flows and read
  access to relevant collection/items.
