aliases: []
summary: Dragonfly is an open source P2P-based file distribution and image acceleration system.
  It is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as an Incubating Level Project.
  Dragonfly uses JWT to verify user. However, the secret key for JWT, "Secret Key", is hard
  coded, which leads to authentication bypass. An attacker can perform any action as a user
  with admin privileges. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.0.9. All users are
  advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
