summary: 'Receipt of a specifically malformed IPv6 packet processed by the router may trigger
  a line card reset: processor exception 0x68616c74 (halt) in task: scheduler. The line card
  will reboot and recover without user interaction. However, additional specifically malformed
  packets may cause follow-on line card resets and lead to an extended service outage. This
  issue only affects E Series routers with IPv6 licensed and enabled. Routers not configured
  to process IPv6 traffic are unaffected by this vulnerability. Juniper SIRT is not aware of
  any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms
  are affected by this issue.'
