aliases: []
summary: wandb/openui latest commit c945bb859979659add5f490a874140ad17c56a5d contains a vulnerability
  where unauthenticated endpoints allow file uploads and downloads from an AWS S3 bucket. This
  can lead to multiple security issues including denial of service, stored XSS, and information
  disclosure. The affected endpoints are '/v1/share/{id:str}' for uploading and '/v1/share/{id:str}'
  for downloading JSON files. The lack of authentication allows any user to upload and overwrite
  files, potentially causing the S3 bucket to run out of space, injecting malicious scripts,
  and accessing sensitive information.
