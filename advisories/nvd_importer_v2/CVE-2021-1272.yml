aliases: []
summary: A vulnerability in the session validation feature of Cisco Data Center Network Manager
  (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct
  a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due
  to insufficient validation of parameters in a specific HTTP request by an attacker. An attacker
  could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an authenticated user
  of the DCNM web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass access
  controls and gain unauthorized access to the Device Manager application, which provides access
  to network devices managed by the system.
