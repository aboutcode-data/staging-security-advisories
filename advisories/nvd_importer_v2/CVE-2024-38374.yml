aliases: []
summary: The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities
  to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Before deserializing CycloneDX Bill
  of Materials in XML format, _cyclonedx-core-java_ leverages XPath expressions to determine
  the schema version of the BOM. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` used to evaluate XPath expressions
  was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
  This vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 9.0.4.
