aliases: []
summary: 'SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system for creating
  and managing security-critical application permissions. Any user making a negative authorization
  decision based on the results of a `LookupResources` request with 1.22.0 is affected. For
  example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some
  subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to
  find a list of banned resources instead, then some users that shouldn''t have access may.
  Generally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be to gate access in this way - that''s
  what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this
  bug since its initial release. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable
  to upgrade should avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions.'
