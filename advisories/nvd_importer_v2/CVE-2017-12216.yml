summary: 'A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an
  unauthenticated, remote attacker to have read and write access to information stored in the
  affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE)
  entries when parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing
  the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries,
  which could allow the attacker to read and write files and execute remote code within the
  application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf47946.'
