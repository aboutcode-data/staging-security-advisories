aliases: []
summary: In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.2, an account hijacking vulnerability exists due to
  a password reset token leak. A user with a 'viewer' role can exploit this vulnerability to
  hijack another user's account by obtaining the password reset token. The vulnerability is
  triggered when the 'viewer' role user sends a specific request to the server, which responds
  with a password reset token in the 'recoveryToken' parameter. This token can then be used
  to reset the password of another user's account without authorization. The issue results from
  an excessive attack surface, allowing lower-privileged users to escalate their privileges
  and take over accounts.
