aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the ABRT daemon’s handling of user-supplied mount information.ABRT
  copies up to 12 characters from an untrusted input and places them directly into a shell command
  (docker inspect %s) without proper validation. An unprivileged local user can craft a payload
  that injects shell metacharacters, causing the root-running ABRT process to execute attacker-controlled
  commands and ultimately gain full root privileges.
