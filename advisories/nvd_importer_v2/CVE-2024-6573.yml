aliases: []
summary: The Intelligence plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all
  versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due the plugin not preventing direct access
  to the /vendor/levelten/intel/realtime/index.php file and display_errors being enabled. This
  makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application,
  which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own,
  and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.
