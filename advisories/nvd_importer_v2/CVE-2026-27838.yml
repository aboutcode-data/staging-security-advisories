aliases: []
summary: wger is a free, open-source workout and fitness manager. Five routine detail action
  endpoints check a cache before calling `self.get_object()`. In versions up to and including
  2.4, ache keys are scoped only by `pk` — no user ID is included. When a victim has previously
  accessed their routine via the API, an attacker can retrieve the cached response for the same
  PK without any ownership check. Commit e964328784e2ee2830a1991d69fadbce86ac9fbf contains a
  patch for the issue.
