aliases: []
summary: 'An issue was discovered in RIPE NCC RPKI Validator 3.x before 3.1-2020.07.06.14.28.
  RRDP fetches proceed even with a lack of validation of a TLS HTTPS endpoint. This allows remote
  attackers to bypass intended access restrictions, or to trigger denial of service to traffic
  directed to co-dependent routing systems. NOTE: third parties assert that the behavior is
  intentionally permitted by RFC 8182'
