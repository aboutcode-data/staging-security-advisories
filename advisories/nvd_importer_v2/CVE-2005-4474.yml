aliases: []
summary: 'Buffer overflow in the "Add to archive" command in WinRAR 3.51 allows user-assisted
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by tricking
  the user into adding a file whose filename contains a non-default code page and non-ANSI characters,
  as demonstrated using a Chinese filename, possibly due to buffer expansion when using the
  WideCharToMultiByte API.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this problem can be exploited for
  code execution. If not, then perhaps the user-assisted nature of the attack should exclude
  the issue from inclusion in CVE.'
