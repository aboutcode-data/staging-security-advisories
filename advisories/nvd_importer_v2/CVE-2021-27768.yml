aliases: []
summary: Using the ability to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, which indicates a lack
  of hostname verification, sensitive account information was able to be intercepted. In this
  specific scenario, the application's network traffic was intercepted using a proxy server
  set up in 'transparent' mode while a certificate with an invalid hostname was active. The
  Android application was found to have hostname verification issues during the server setup
  and login flows; however, the application did not process requests post-login.
