aliases: []
summary: 'Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) 7.1(x) through 9.1(2) and the IM & Presence
  Service in Cisco Unified Presence Server through 9.1(2) use the same CTI and database-encryption
  key across different customers'' installations, which makes it easier for context-dependent
  attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this key,
  aka Bug IDs CSCsc69187 and CSCui01756.  NOTE: the vendor has provided a statement that the
  "hard-coded static encryption key is considered a hardening issue rather than a vulnerability,
  and as such, has a CVSS score of 0/0."'
