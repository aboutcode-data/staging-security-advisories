aliases: []
summary: A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the /load-workflow endpoint of
  modelscope/agentscope version v0.0.4. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary
  files from the server, including sensitive files such as API keys, by manipulating the filename
  parameter. The issue arises due to improper sanitization of user input passed to the os.path.join
  function, which can be exploited to access files outside the intended directory.
