aliases: []
summary: 'Vert.x-Web is a set of building blocks for building web applications in the java programming
  language. When running vertx web applications that serve files using `StaticHandler` on Windows
  Operating Systems and Windows File Systems, if the mount point is a wildcard (`*`) then an
  attacker can exfiltrate any class path resource. When computing the relative path to locate
  the resource, in case of wildcards, the code: `return "/" + rest;` from `Utils.java` returns
  the user input (without validation) as the segment to lookup. Even though checks are performed
  to avoid escaping the sandbox, given that the input was not sanitized `\` are not properly
  handled and an attacker can build a path that is valid within the classpath. This issue only
  affects users deploying in windows environments and upgrading is the advised remediation path.
  There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.'
