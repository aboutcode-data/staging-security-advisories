aliases: []
summary: The E-POINT CMS eagle.gsam-1169.1 file upload feature improperly handles nested archive
  files. An attacker can upload a nested ZIP (a ZIP containing another ZIP) where the inner
  archive contains an executable file (e.g. webshell.php). When the application extracts the
  uploaded archives, the executable may be extracted into a web-accessible directory. This can
  lead to remote code execution (RCE), data disclosure, account compromise, or further system
  compromise depending on the web server/process privileges. The issue arises from insufficient
  validation of archive contents and inadequate restrictions on extraction targets.
