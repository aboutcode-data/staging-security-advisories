aliases: []
summary: is-arrayish checks if an object can be used like an Array. On 8 September 2025, an
  npm publishing account for is-arrayish was taken over after a phishing attack. Version 0.3.3
  was published, functionally identical to the previous patch version, but with a malware payload
  added attempting to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to the attacker's own addresses from
  within browser environments. Local environments, server environments, command line applications,
  etc. are not affected. If the package was used in a browser context (e.g. a direct <script>
  inclusion, or via a bundling tool such as Babel, Rollup, Vite, Next.js, etc.) there is a chance
  the malware still exists and such bundles will need to be rebuilt. The malware seemingly only
  targets cryptocurrency transactions and wallets such as MetaMask. See references below for
  more information on the payload. npm removed the offending package from the registry over
  the course of the day on 8 September, preventing further downloads from npm proper. On 13
  September, the package owner published new patch versions to help cache-bust those using private
  registries who might still have the compromised version cached. Users should update to the
  latest patch version, completely remove their node_modules directory, clean their package
  manager's global cache, and rebuild any browser bundles from scratch. Those operating private
  registries or registry mirrors should purge the offending versions from any caches. This issue
  is resolved in 0.3.4.
