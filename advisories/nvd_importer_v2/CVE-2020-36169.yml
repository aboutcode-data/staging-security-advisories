aliases: []
summary: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup through 8.3.0.1 and OpsCenter through
  8.3.0.1. Processes using OpenSSL attempt to load and execute libraries from paths that do
  not exist by default on the Windows operating system. By default, on Windows systems, users
  can create directories under the top level of any drive. If a low privileged user creates
  an affected path with a library that the Veritas product attempts to load, they can execute
  arbitrary code as SYSTEM or Administrator. This gives the attacker administrator access on
  the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications,
  etc. This vulnerability affects master servers, media servers, clients, and OpsCenter servers
  on the Windows platform. The system is vulnerable during an install or upgrade and post-install
  during normal operations.
