aliases: []
summary: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.3, are
  subject to Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, resulting in Denial of Service.
  An attacker can make a Meteor call to `validateAuthToken` using a victim's userId, meetingId,
  and an invalid authToken. This forces the victim to leave the conference, because the resulting
  verification failure is also observed and handled by the victim's client. The attacker must
  be a participant in any meeting on the server. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. There
  are no workarounds.
