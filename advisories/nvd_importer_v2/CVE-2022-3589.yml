aliases: []
summary: An API Endpoint used by Miele's "AppWash" MobileApp in all versions was vulnerable
  to an authorization bypass. A low privileged, remote attacker would have been able to gain
  read and partial write access to other users data by modifying a small part of a HTTP request
  sent to the API. Reading or changing the password of another user was not possible, thus no
  impact to Availability.
