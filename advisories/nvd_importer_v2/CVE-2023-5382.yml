summary: The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
  on the fnsf_delete_posts function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
  delete arbitrary posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
  performing an action such as clicking on a link.
