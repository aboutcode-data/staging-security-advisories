aliases: []
summary: The AuthPolicy metadata on Red Hat Connectivity Link contains an object which stores
  secretes, however it assumes those secretes are already in the kuadrant-system instead of
  copying it to the referred namespace. This creates space for a malicious actor with a developer
  persona access to leak those secrets over HTTP connection, as long the attacker knows the
  name of the targeted secrets and those secrets are limited to one line only.
