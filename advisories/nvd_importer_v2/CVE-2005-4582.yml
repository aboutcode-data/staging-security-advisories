aliases: []
summary: 'Electric Sheep 2.6.3 does not require authentication or integrity checks from the
  server to the client, which allows remote attackers to download and display arbitrary MPEG
  movie files via (1) DNS spoofing, (2) a URL on the command line, or (3) a URL in the configuration
  file. NOTE: the same attack vectors apply to common web browsers that are able to communicate
  with untrusted web servers, and other problems related to DNS design issues.  Therefore this
  may not be a specific vulnerability.  However, a client would reasonably expect to receive
  content only from the server.'
