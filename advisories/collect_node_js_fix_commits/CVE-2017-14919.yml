  068cede663f94f3b7aba11271378b335d337e86e:2017-10-24, Version 4.8.5 'Argon' (Maintenance)

  This is a security release. All Node.js users should consult the
  security release summary at:
  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/oct-2017-dos/

  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Notable Changes:

  * zlib:
    - CVE-2017-14919 - In zlib v1.2.9, a change was made that causes an
    error to be raised when a raw deflate stream is initialized with
    windowBits set to 8. On some versions this crashes Node and you
    cannot recover from it, while on some versions it throws an
    exception. Node.js will now gracefully set windowBits to 9
    replicating the legacy behavior to avoid a DOS vector.
