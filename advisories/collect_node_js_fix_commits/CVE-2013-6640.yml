  39e2426b209799d5deaa29d2401dd98f060babda:v8: backport fix for CVE-2013-{6639|6640}

  Quoting CVE-2013-6639:

      The DehoistArrayIndex function in hydrogen-dehoist.cc in Google V8
      before 3.22.24.7, as used in Google Chrome before 31.0.1650.63,
      allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
      write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via JavaScript code
      that sets the value of an array element with a crafted index.

  Quoting CVE-2013-6640:

      The DehoistArrayIndex function in hydrogen-dehoist.cc in Google V8
      before 3.22.24.7, as used in Google Chrome before 31.0.1650.63,
      allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
      read) via JavaScript code that sets a variable to the value of an
      array element with a crafted index.

  Like 6b92a7, this is unlikely to affect node.js because it only runs
  local, trusted code.  However, if there exists some module somewhere
  that populates an array index with remotely provided data this could
  very well be used to crash a remote server running node.  Defense in
  depth and all.

  This is a backport of upstream commit r17801. Original commit log:

      Limit size of dehoistable array indices
