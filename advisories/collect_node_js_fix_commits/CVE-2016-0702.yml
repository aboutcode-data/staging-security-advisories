  * openssl: Upgrade from 1.0.2f to 1.0.2g (Ben Noordhuis) https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5507
    - Fix a double-free defect in parsing malformed DSA keys that may potentially be used for DoS or memory corruption attacks. It is likely to be very difficult to use this defect for a practical attack and is therefore considered low severity for Node.js users. More info is available at CVE-2016-0705 https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-0705.
    - Fix a defect that can cause memory corruption in certain very rare cases relating to the internal `BN_hex2bn()` and `BN_dec2bn()` functions. It is believed that Node.js is not invoking the code paths that use these functions so practical attacks via Node.js using this defect are _unlikely_ to be possible. More info is available at CVE-2016-0797 https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-0797.
    - Fix a defect that makes the _CacheBleed Atta https://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/cachebleed/ _ possible. This defect enables attackers to execute side-channel attacks leading to the potential recovery of entire RSA private keys. It only affects the Intel Sandy Bridge (and possibly older) microarchitecture when using hyper-threading. Newer microarchitectures, including Haswell, are unaffected. More info is available at CVE-2016-0702 https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2016-0702.
