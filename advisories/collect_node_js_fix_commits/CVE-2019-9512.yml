  affa23bc88849f962e6fd784852c3db242bfeb19:2019-08-15, Version 8.16.1 'Carbon' (LTS)

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  Node.js, as well as many other implementations of HTTP/2, have been
  found vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks.
  See https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md
  for more information.

  Vulnerabilities fixed:

  * CVE-2019-9511 “Data Dribble”: The attacker requests a large amount of
    data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate
    window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data
    in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued,
    this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a
    denial of service.
  * CVE-2019-9512 “Ping Flood”: The attacker sends continual pings to an
    HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.
    Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume
    excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of
    service.
  * CVE-2019-9513 “Resource Loop”: The attacker creates multiple request
    streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way
    that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume
    excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service.
  * CVE-2019-9514 “Reset Flood”: The attacker opens a number of streams
    and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a
    stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer
    queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU,or
    both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
  * CVE-2019-9515 “Settings Flood”: The attacker sends a stream of
    SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer
    reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS
    frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how
    efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory,
    or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
  * CVE-2019-9516 “0-Length Headers Leak”: The attacker sends a stream of
    headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value,
    optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some
    implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the
    allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess
    memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.
  * CVE-2019-9517 “Internal Data Buffering”: The attacker opens the HTTP/2
    window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave
    the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the
    bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a
    large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the
    responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially
    leading to a denial of service.
  * CVE-2019-9518 “Empty Frames Flood”: The attacker sends a stream of
    frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These
    frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The
    peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack
    bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. (Discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google)
