  0e6750d1cde710bcdea7657b3800bb5c65e5c70f:2016-10-18 Node.js v6.9.0 'Boron' (LTS) Release

  This release marks the transition of Node.js v6 into Long Term Support
  (LTS) with the codename 'Boron'. The v6 release line now moves in to
  "Active LTS" and will remain so until April 2018. After that time it
  will move in to "Maintenance" until end of life in April 2019.

  This is also a security release. All Node.js users should consult the
  security release summary at
  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/october-2016-security-releases/
  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Notable changes:

  * crypto: Don't automatically attempt to load an OpenSSL configuration
    file, from the `OPENSSL_CONF` environment variable or from the
    default location for the current platform. Always triggering a
    configuration file load attempt may allow an attacker to load
    compromised OpenSSL configuration into a Node.js process if they are
    able to place a file in a default location. (Fedor Indutny, Rod Vagg)
  * node: Introduce the `process.release.lts` property, set to `"Boron"`.
    This value is `"Argon"` for v4 LTS releases and `undefined` for all
    other releases. (Rod Vagg)
  * V8: Backport fix for CVE-2016-5172, an arbitrary memory read.
    The parser in V8 mishandled scopes, potentially allowing an attacker
    to obtain sensitive information from arbitrary memory locations via
    crafted JavaScript code. This vulnerability would require an
    attacker to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a
    Node.js process. (Rod Vagg)
  * **v8_inspector**: Generate a UUID for each execution of the
    inspector. This provides additional security to prevent unauthorized
    clients from connecting to the Node.js process via the v8_inspector
    port when running with `--inspect`. Since the debugging protocol
    allows extensive access to the internals of a running process, and
    the execution of arbitrary code, it is important to limit
    connections to authorized tools only. Vulnerability originally
    reported by Jann Horn. (Eugene Ostroukhov)
