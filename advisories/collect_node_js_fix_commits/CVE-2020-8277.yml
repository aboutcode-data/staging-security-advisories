  88d0b5b2fbbb40cf7a93f3045672870a8767b3f2:2020-11-16, Version 12.19.1 'Erbium' (LTS)

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  Vulnerabilities fixed:

  * CVE-2020-8277: Denial of Service through DNS request (High). A Node.js
    application that allows an attacker to trigger a DNS request for a
    host of their choice could trigger a Denial of Service by getting the
    application to resolve a DNS record with a larger number of responses.

  PR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs-private/node-private/pull/233
  f67088efecd4e2afcaf8e9c7827f7e111d8cc02a:2020-11-16, Version 14.15.1 'Fermium' (LTS)

  a81aa37944a6b3efad49c15bbb62cbd1522631f4:deps: cherry-pick 0d252eb from upstream c-ares

  Original commit message:

    If there are more ttls returned than the maximum provided by the requestor, then
    the *naddrttls response would be larger than the actual number of elements in
    the addrttls array.

    This bug could lead to invalid memory accesses in applications using c-ares.

    This behavior appeared to break with PR https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/pull/257

    Fixes: https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/issues/371
