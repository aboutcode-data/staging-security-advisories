  b82f905a8b8164d2ba72d8a42e91b1449902d456:deps: upgrade to c-ares v1.14.0

   * Fix patch for CVE-2017-1000381 to not be overly aggressive.
   * win32: Preserve DNS server order returned by Windows when sorting and
     exclude DNS servers in legacy subnets.
   * win32: Support most recent Visual Studio 2017.
   * gethostbyaddr should fail with ECANCELLED not ENOTFOUND when
     ares_cancel is called.
   * win32: Exclude legacy ipv6 subnets.
   * android: Applications compiled for Oreo can no longer use
     __system_property_get and must use Java calls to retrieve DNS
     servers.
   * win32: Force use of ANSI functions.
   * CMake minimum version is now 3.1.
   * ares_gethostbyname.3: fix callback status values.
   * docs: Document WSAStartup requirement.
   * Fix a typo in init_by_resolv_conf.
   * Android JNI code leaks local references in some cases.
   * Force using the ANSI versions of WinAPI functions.

  The most important changes have already been included via

   * 50e580df21 deps: cherry-pick 0ef4a0c64b6 from c-ares upstream
   * 9a0631dffe deps: cherry-pick 18ea996 from c-ares upstream

  22889347dfe5315fe03abb9a4263c30cdd74b436:2017-07-11, Version 8.1.4 (Current)

  This is a security release. All Node.js users should consult the
  security release summary at
  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2017-security-releases/
  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Notable changes

  * **build**:
    - Disable V8 snapshots - The hashseed embedded in the snapshot is
      currently the same for all runs of the binary. This opens node up to
  collision attacks which could result in a Denial of Service. We have
  temporarily disabled snapshots until a more robust solution is found
  (Ali Ijaz Sheikh)
  * **deps**:
    - CVE-2017-1000381 - The c-ares function ares_parse_naptr_reply(),
      which is used for parsing NAPTR responses, could be triggered to
  read memory outside of the given input buffer if the passed in DNS
  response packet was crafted in a particular way. This patch checks that
  there is enough data for the required elements of an NAPTR record (2
  int16, 3 bytes for string lengths) before processing a record. (David
  Drysdale)
