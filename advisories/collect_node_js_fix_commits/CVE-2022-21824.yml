  c4194c0dce93566fd463ff575726064886c74c1e:2022-01-10, Version 17.3.1 (Current)

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  Improper handling of URI Subject Alternative Names (Medium)(CVE-2021-44531)
  - Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI
  is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in
  bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Node.js was accepting URI SAN
  types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a
  protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this disable the URI SAN type when
  checking a certificate against a hostname. This behavior can be
  reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line option.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44531

  Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection (Medium)(CVE-2021-44532)
  - Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format.
  It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when
  validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection
  vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate
  chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this escape SANs containing the
  problematic characters in order to prevent the injection. This
  behavior can be reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line
  option.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44532

  Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533)
  - Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names
  correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a
  single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject
  a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject
  verification.
  - Affected versions of Node.js do not accept multi-value Relative
  Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks
  themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's ambiguous
  presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44533

  Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)
  - Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was
  not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the `properties`
  parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one
  property as the first parameter, which could be `__proto__`. The
  prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an
  empty string to be assigned numerical keys of the object prototype.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this use a null protoype for the
  object these properties are being assigned to.

  Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection (Medium)(CVE-2021-44532)
  - Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format.
  It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when
  validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection
  vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate
  chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this escape SANs containing the
  problematic characters in order to prevent the injection. This
  behavior can be reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line
  option.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44532

  Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533)
  - Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names
  correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a
  single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject
  a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject
  verification.
  - Affected versions of Node.js do not accept multi-value Relative
  Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks
  themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's ambiguous
  presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.

  Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)
  - Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was
  not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the `properties`
  parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one
  property as the first parameter, which could be `__proto__`. The
  prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an
  empty string to be assigned numerical keys of the object prototype.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this use a null protoype for the
  object these properties are being assigned to.

  acb71eab779fb56bf70e8a9e0cb2e82a089a87de:2022-01-10, Version 16.13.2 'Gallium' (LTS)

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  Improper handling of URI Subject Alternative Names (Medium)(CVE-2021-44531)
  - Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI
  is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in
  bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Node.js was accepting URI SAN
  types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a
  protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this disable the URI SAN type when
  checking a certificate against a hostname. This behavior can be
  reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line option.
