  0d64a560121e7420df9df7c2b5a7e162c4ef307b:2019-02-28, Version 6.17.0 'Boron' (LTS)

  This is a security release. All Node.js users should consult the security
  release summary at:

    https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/

  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Fixes for the following CVEs are included in this release:

    * Node.js: Denial of Service with keep-alive HTTP connections
      (CVE-2019-5739)
    * Node.js: Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service with keep-alive
      (CVE-2019-5737)
    * OpenSSL: 0-byte record padding oracle (CVE-2019-1559)

  Notable Changes:

  * deps: OpenSSL has been upgraded to 1.0.2r which contains a fix for
    CVE-2019-1559 (https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190226.txt). Under
    certain circumstances, a TLS server can be forced to respond differently to
    a client if a zero-byte record is received with an invalid padding
    compared to a zero-byte record with an invalid MAC. This can be used as the
    basis of a padding oracle attack to decrypt data.
  * http:
    - Backport `server.keepAliveTimeout` to prevent keep-alive HTTP and HTTPS
      connections remaining open and inactive for an extended period of time,
      leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS).
      (CVE-2019-5739 / Timur Shemsedinov, Matteo Collina)
    - Further prevention of "Slowloris" attacks on HTTP and HTTPS
      connections by consistently applying the receive timeout set by
      `server.headersTimeout` to connections in keep-alive mode. Reported by
      Marco Pracucci (https://voxnest.com). (CVE-2019-5737 / Matteo Collina)
