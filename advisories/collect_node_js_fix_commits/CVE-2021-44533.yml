  c4194c0dce93566fd463ff575726064886c74c1e:2022-01-10, Version 17.3.1 (Current)

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  Improper handling of URI Subject Alternative Names (Medium)(CVE-2021-44531)
  - Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI
  is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in
  bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Node.js was accepting URI SAN
  types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a
  protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this disable the URI SAN type when
  checking a certificate against a hostname. This behavior can be
  reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line option.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44531

  Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection (Medium)(CVE-2021-44532)
  - Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format.
  It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when
  validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection
  vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate
  chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this escape SANs containing the
  problematic characters in order to prevent the injection. This
  behavior can be reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line
  option.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44532

  Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533)
  - Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names
  correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a
  single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject
  a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject
  verification.
  - Affected versions of Node.js do not accept multi-value Relative
  Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks
  themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's ambiguous
  presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.

  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44533

  Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)
  - Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was
  not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the `properties`
  parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one
  property as the first parameter, which could be `__proto__`. The
  prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an
  empty string to be assigned numerical keys of the object prototype.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this use a null protoype for the
  object these properties are being assigned to.

  a336444c7fb9fd1d0055481d84cdd57d7d569879:tls: fix handling of x509 subject and issuer

  When subject and verifier are represented as strings, escape special
  characters (such as '+') to guarantee unambiguity. Previously, different
  distinguished names could result in the same string when encoded. In
  particular, inserting a '+' in a single-value Relative Distinguished
  Name (e.g., L or OU) would produce a string that is indistinguishable
  from a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name. Third-party code that
  correctly interprets the generated string representation as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name could then be vulnerable to an
  injection attack, e.g., when an attacker includes a single-value RDN
  with type OU and value 'HR + CN=example.com', the string representation
  produced by unpatched versions of Node.js would be
  'OU=HR + CN=example.com', which represents a multi-value RDN.

  Node.js itself is not vulnerable to this attack because the current
  implementation that parses such strings into objects does not handle '+'
  at all. This oversight leads to incorrect results, but at the same time
  appears to prevent injection attacks (as described above).

  With this change, the JavaScript objects representing the subject and
  issuer Relative Distinguished Names are constructed in C++ directly,
  instead of (incorrectly) encoding them as strings and then (incorrectly)
  decoding the strings in JavaScript.

  This addresses CVE-2021-44533.

  from a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name. Third-party code that
  correctly interprets the generated string representation as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name could then be vulnerable to an
  injection attack, e.g., when an attacker includes a single-value RDN
  with type OU and value 'HR + CN=example.com', the string representation
  produced by unpatched versions of Node.js would be
  'OU=HR + CN=example.com', which represents a multi-value RDN.

  Node.js itself is not vulnerable to this attack because the current
  implementation that parses such strings into objects does not handle '+'
  at all. This oversight leads to incorrect results, but at the same time
  appears to prevent injection attacks (as described above).

  With this change, the JavaScript objects representing the subject and
  issuer Relative Distinguished Names are constructed in C++ directly,
  instead of (incorrectly) encoding them as strings and then (incorrectly)
  decoding the strings in JavaScript.

  This addresses CVE-2021-44533.

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  Improper handling of URI Subject Alternative Names (Medium)(CVE-2021-44531)
  - Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI
  is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in
  bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Node.js was accepting URI SAN
  types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a
  protocol allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this disable the URI SAN type when
  checking a certificate against a hostname. This behavior can be
  reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line option.

  - Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names
  correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a
  single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject
  a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject

  - Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was
  not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the `properties`
  parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one
  property as the first parameter, which could be `__proto__`. The

  When subject and verifier are represented as strings, escape special
  characters (such as '+') to guarantee unambiguity. Previously, different
  distinguished names could result in the same string when encoded. In
  particular, inserting a '+' in a single-value Relative Distinguished
  Name (e.g., L or OU) would produce a string that is indistinguishable
  from a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name. Third-party code that
  correctly interprets the generated string representation as a

  injection attack, e.g., when an attacker includes a single-value RDN
  with type OU and value 'HR + CN=example.com', the string representation
  produced by unpatched versions of Node.js would be
  'OU=HR + CN=example.com', which represents a multi-value RDN.

  Node.js itself is not vulnerable to this attack because the current
  implementation that parses such strings into objects does not handle '+'
  at all. This oversight leads to incorrect results, but at the same time
  appears to prevent injection attacks (as described above).

  With this change, the JavaScript objects representing the subject and

  checking a certificate against a hostname. This behavior can be
  reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line option.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44531

  Certificate Verification Bypass via String Injection (Medium)(CVE-2021-44532)
  - Node.js converts SANs (Subject Alternative Names) to a string format.
  It uses this string to check peer certificates against hostnames when
  validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection
  vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate
  chain, allowing the bypass of these name constraints.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this escape SANs containing the
  problematic characters in order to prevent the injection. This
  behavior can be reverted through the `--security-revert` command-line
  option.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44532

  Incorrect handling of certificate subject and issuer fields (Medium)(CVE-2021-44533)
  - Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names
  correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a
  single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject
  a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject
  verification.
  - Affected versions of Node.js do not accept multi-value Relative
  Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks
  themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's ambiguous
  presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44533

  Prototype pollution via `console.table` properties (Low)(CVE-2022-21824)
  - Due to the formatting logic of the `console.table()` function it was
  not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the `properties`
  parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one
  property as the first parameter, which could be `__proto__`. The
  prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an
  empty string to be assigned numerical keys of the object prototype.
  - Versions of Node.js with the fix for this use a null protoype for the
  object these properties are being assigned to.
  - More details will be available at
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21824

  1f7fdff64a9d39ccdd3a5ff3be780cacf2628941:tls: fix handling of x509 subject and issuer

  When subject and verifier are represented as strings, escape special
  characters (such as '+') to guarantee unambiguity. Previously, different
  distinguished names could result in the same string when encoded. In
  particular, inserting a '+' in a single-value Relative Distinguished
  Name (e.g., L or OU) would produce a string that is indistinguishable
  from a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name. Third-party code that
  correctly interprets the generated string representation as a
  multi-value Relative Distinguished Name could then be vulnerable to an
  injection attack, e.g., when an attacker includes a single-value RDN
  with type OU and value 'HR + CN=example.com', the string representation
  produced by unpatched versions of Node.js would be
  'OU=HR + CN=example.com', which represents a multi-value RDN.

  Node.js itself is not vulnerable to this attack because the current
  implementation that parses such strings into objects does not handle '+'
  at all. This oversight leads to incorrect results, but at the same time
  appears to prevent injection attacks (as described above).

  With this change, the JavaScript objects representing the subject and
  issuer Relative Distinguished Names are constructed in C++ directly,
  instead of (incorrectly) encoding them as strings and then (incorrectly)
  decoding the strings in JavaScript.

  This addresses CVE-2021-44533.
