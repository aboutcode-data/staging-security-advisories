  f172c5ad5b5ef126134f45c2626151a675dc4bf3:2021-08-31, Version 14.17.6 'Fermium' (LTS)

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  These are vulnerabilities in the node-tar, arborist, and npm cli modules which
  are related to the initial reports and subsequent remediation of node-tar
  vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32803 (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw)
  and CVE-2021-32804 (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9).
  Subsequent internal security review of node-tar and additional external bounty
  reports have resulted in another 5 CVE being remediated in core npm CLI
  dependencies including node-tar, and npm arborist.
