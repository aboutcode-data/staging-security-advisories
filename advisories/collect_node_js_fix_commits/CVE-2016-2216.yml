  1a68f85c4ed24e49f61494c09066f67d0bf73aa9:2016-02-09, Version 5.6.0 (Stable)

  This is an important security release. All Node.js users should
  consult the security release summary at nodejs.org for details on
  patched vulnerabilities.

  Notable changes

  * http: fix defects in HTTP header parsing for requests and responses
    that can allow request smuggling (CVE-2016-2086) or response
    splitting (CVE-2016-2216). HTTP header parsing now aligns more
    closely with the HTTP spec including restricting the acceptable
    characters.
  * http-parser: upgrade from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1
  * npm: upgrade npm from 3.3.12 to 3.6.0
    (Rebecca Turner) https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4958
  * openssl: upgrade from 1.0.2e to 1.0.2f. To mitigate against the
    Logjam attack, TLS clients now reject Diffie-Hellman handshakes with
    parameters shorter than 1024-bits, up from the previous limit of
    768-bits.
  7daded4ff05ad052c23363aad97291da46cc4925:2016-02-09, Version 4.3.0 'Argon' (LTS)

  This is an important security release. All Node.js users should
  consult the security release summary at nodejs.org for details on
  patched vulnerabilities.

  Note that this release includes a non-backward compatible change to
  address a security issue. This change increases the version of the LTS
  v4.x line to v4.3.0. There will be *no further updates* to v4.2.x.

  * http: fix defects in HTTP header parsing for requests and responses
    that can allow request smuggling (CVE-2016-2086) or response
    splitting (CVE-2016-2216). HTTP header parsing now aligns more
    closely with the HTTP spec including restricting the acceptable
    characters.
  * http-parser: upgrade from 2.5.0 to 2.5.1
  * openssl: upgrade from 1.0.2e to 1.0.2f. To mitigate against the
    Logjam attack, TLS clients now reject Diffie-Hellman handshakes with
    parameters shorter than 1024-bits, up from the previous limit of
    768-bits.
  * src:
    - introduce new `--security-revert={cvenum}` command line flag for
      selective reversion of specific CVE fixes
    - allow the fix for CVE-2016-2216 to be selectively reverted using
      `--security-revert=CVE-2016-2216`

    - introduce new `--security-revert={cvenum}` command line flag for
      selective reversion of specific CVE fixes
    - allow the fix for CVE-2016-2216 to be selectively reverted using
      `--security-revert=CVE-2016-2216`
  * build:
    - xz compressed tar files will be made available from nodejs.org for
      v0.12 builds from v0.12.10 onward
    - A headers.tar.gz file will be made available from nodejs.org for
      v0.12 builds from v0.12.10 onward, a future change to node-gyp
      will be required to make use of these

  0e0aa28871732c57a2e11bd6e4371f8f98331e41:2016-02-09, Version 0.10.42 (Maintenance)

  This is an important security release. All Node.js users should
  consult the security release summary at nodejs.org for details on
  patched vulnerabilities.

  Notable changes:

  * http: fix defects in HTTP header parsing for requests and responses
    that can allow request smuggling (CVE-2016-2086) or response
    splitting (CVE-2016-2216). HTTP header parsing now aligns more
    closely with the HTTP spec including restricting the acceptable
    characters.
  * http-parser: upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1
  * openssl: upgrade from 1.0.1q to 1.0.1r. To mitigate against the
    Logjam attack, TLS clients now reject Diffie-Hellman handshakes with
    parameters shorter than 1024-bits, up from the previous limit of
    768-bits.
