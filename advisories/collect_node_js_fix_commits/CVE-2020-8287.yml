  ceb0dc907a571edea326d2cd5f846f8d31e95caf:2021-01-04, Version 12.20.1 'Erbium' (LTS)

  Notable changes:

  This is a security release.

  Vulnerabilities fixed:

  - CVE-2020-8265: use-after-free in TLSWrap (High)
  Affected Node.js versions are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in
  its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket,
  node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly
  allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method
  does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller
  as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to
  corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other
  exploits
  - CVE-2020-8287: HTTP Request Smuggling in nodejs
  Affected versions of Node.js allow two copies of a header field in
  a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields.
  In this case Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores
  the second. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling
  (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/444.html).
  - CVE-2020-1971: OpenSSL - EDIPARTYNAME NULL pointer de-reference (High)
  This is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited through Node.js.

  051154e0e68b72cbd34068f4e2676bfb4c59439a:http: unset `F_CHUNKED` on new `Transfer-Encoding`

  Duplicate `Transfer-Encoding` header should be a treated as a single,
  but with original header values concatenated with a comma separator. In
  the light of this, even if the past `Transfer-Encoding` ended with
  `chunked`, we should be not let the `F_CHUNKED` to leak into the next
  header, because mere presence of another header indicates that `chunked`
  is not the last transfer-encoding token.
