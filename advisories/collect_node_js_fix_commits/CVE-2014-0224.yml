  eeb08ca496c1401b295385d53ffa1f853133eeb6:2014.06.09, Version 0.8.27 (maintenance)

  * openssl: update to 1.0.0m (CVE-2014-0224)

  * utf8: Prevent Node from sending invalid UTF-8 (Felix Geisendörfer)
    - *NOTE* this introduces a breaking change, previously you could construct
  invalid UTF-8 and invoke an error in a client that was expecting valid
  UTF-8, now unmatched surrogate pairs are replaced with the unknown UTF-8
  character. To restore the old functionality simply have NODE_INVALID_UTF8
  environment variable set.

  * tls: fix pool usage race (Fedor Indutny)

  * fs: close file if fstat() fails in readFile() (cjihrig)
