  8e173836538efb95f5ac5e898f177efff681d2aa:2020-09-15, Version 14.11.0 (Current)

  This is a security release.

  Notable changes:

  Vulnerabilities fixed:

  - CVE-2020-8251: Denial of Service by resource exhaustion CWE-400 due
    to unfinished HTTP/1.1 requests (Critical).
  - CVE-2020-8201: HTTP Request Smuggling due to CR-to-Hyphen conversion
    (High).

  PR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs-private/node-private/pull/225
  df08d527c2083b852d8456b88b39114f30525236:http: add requestTimeout

  This commits introduces a new http.Server option called requestTimeout
  with a default value in milliseconds of 0.

  If requestTimeout is set to a positive value, the server will start a new
  timer set to expire in requestTimeout milliseconds when a new connection
  is established. The timer is also set again if new requests after the
  first are received on the socket (this handles pipelining and keep-alive
  cases).
  The timer is cancelled when:

  1. the request body is completely received by the server.
  2. the response is completed. This handles the case where the
  application responds to the client without consuming the request body.
  3. the connection is upgraded, like in the WebSocket case.

  If the timer expires, then the server responds with status code 408 and
  closes the connection.
