  cc399cf5b2253dd9f3bcdeeff422059d58795d75:2018-11-27, Version 11.3.0 (Current)

  This is a security release. All Node.js users should consult the security
  release summary at:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/november-2018-security-releases/

  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Fixes for the following CVEs are included in this release:

    * Node.js: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121)
    * Node.js: Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service (CVE-2018-12122 / Node.js)
    * Node.js: Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol
      (CVE-2018-12123)
    * OpenSSL: Timing vulnerability in DSA signature generation (CVE-2018-0734)
    * OpenSSL: Timing vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation (CVE-2019-0735)

  Notable Changes:

  * deps: Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.0j, fixing CVE-2018-0734 and CVE-2019-0735
  * http:
    * Headers received by HTTP servers must not exceed 8192 bytes in total to
      prevent possible Denial of Service attacks. Reported by Trevor Norris.
      (CVE-2018-12121 / Matteo Collina)
    * A timeout of 40 seconds now applies to servers receiving HTTP headers. This
      value can be adjusted with `server.headersTimeout`. Where headers are not
      completely received within this period, the socket is destroyed on the next
      received chunk. In conjunction with `server.setTimeout()`, this aids in
      protecting against excessive resource retention and possible Denial of
      Service. Reported by Jan Maybach (liebdich.com).
  * url: Fix a bug that would allow a hostname being spoofed when parsing URLs
    with `url.parse()` with the `'javascript:'` protocol. Reported by
    Martin Bajanik (kenticocloud.com). (CVE-2018-12123 / Matteo Collina)
