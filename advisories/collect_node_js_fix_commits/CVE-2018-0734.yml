  cc399cf5b2253dd9f3bcdeeff422059d58795d75:2018-11-27, Version 11.3.0 (Current)

  This is a security release. All Node.js users should consult the security
  release summary at:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/november-2018-security-releases/

  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Fixes for the following CVEs are included in this release:

    * Node.js: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121)
    * Node.js: Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service (CVE-2018-12122 / Node.js)
    * Node.js: Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol
      (CVE-2018-12123)
    * OpenSSL: Timing vulnerability in DSA signature generation (CVE-2018-0734)
    * OpenSSL: Timing vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation (CVE-2019-0735)

  Notable Changes:

  * deps: Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.0j, fixing CVE-2018-0734 and CVE-2019-0735
  * http:
    * Headers received by HTTP servers must not exceed 8192 bytes in total to
      prevent possible Denial of Service attacks. Reported by Trevor Norris.
      (CVE-2018-12121 / Matteo Collina)
    * A timeout of 40 seconds now applies to servers receiving HTTP headers. This
      value can be adjusted with `server.headersTimeout`. Where headers are not
      completely received within this period, the socket is destroyed on the next
      received chunk. In conjunction with `server.setTimeout()`, this aids in
      protecting against excessive resource retention and possible Denial of
      Service. Reported by Jan Maybach (liebdich.com).
  * url: Fix a bug that would allow a hostname being spoofed when parsing URLs
    with `url.parse()` with the `'javascript:'` protocol. Reported by
    Martin Bajanik (kenticocloud.com). (CVE-2018-12123 / Matteo Collina)

    * Headers received by HTTP servers must not exceed 8192 bytes in total to
      prevent possible Denial of Service attacks. Reported by Trevor Norris.
      (CVE-2018-12121 / Matteo Collina)
    * A timeout of 40 seconds now applies to servers receiving HTTP headers. This
      value can be adjusted with `server.headersTimeout`. Where headers are not
      completely received within this period, the socket is destroyed on the next
      received chunk. In conjunction with `server.setTimeout()`, this aids in
      protecting against excessive resource retention and possible Denial of
      Service. Reported by Jan Maybach (liebdich.com).

    with `url.parse()` with the `'javascript:'` protocol. Reported by

  323a365766e30895860ce0e0ac95f7f33a060021:deps: float 26d7fce1 from openssl

  The fix for CVE-2018-0734, floated in 213c7d2d, failed to include a
  constant-time calculation for one of the variables. This introduces
  a fix for that.

  Upstream: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/26d7fce1

  Original commit message:
    Add a constant time flag to one of the bignums to avoid a timing leak.

  Low severity timing vulnerability in the DSA signature algorithm

  Publicly disclosed but unreleased, pending OpenSSL 1.1.0j

  Ref: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/7486
  Ref: https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20181030.txt
  PR-URL: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/???
  Upstream: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/a9cfb8c2

  Original commit message:

      Avoid a timing attack that leaks information via a side channel that
      triggers when a BN is resized.  Increasing the size of the BNs
      prior to doing anything with them suppresses the attack.

      Thanks due to Samuel Weiser for finding and locating this.
