  80310e916aff24dc6b3477ad52a697dff84fc78e:2018-03-28, Version 9.10.0 (Current)

  This is a security release. All Node.js users should consult the
  security release summary at:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/

  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Fixes for the following CVEs are included in this release:

  * CVE-2018-7158
  * CVE-2018-7159
  * CVE-2018-7160

  Notable changes:

  * Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2o: Does not contain any security fixes that
    are known to impact Node.js.
  * **Fix for inspector DNS rebinding vulnerability (CVE-2018-7160)**:
    A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick a web
    browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and allow HTTP
    connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network,
    potentially to an open inspector port as a debugger, therefore
    gaining full code execution access. The inspector now only allows
    connections that have a browser `Host` value of `localhost` or
    `localhost6`.
  * **Fix for `'path'` module regular expression denial of service
    (CVE-2018-7158)**: A regular expression used for parsing POSIX an
    Windows paths could be used to cause a denial of service if an
    attacker were able to have a specially crafted path string passed
    through one of the impacted `'path'` module functions.
  * **Reject spaces in HTTP `Content-Length` header values
    (CVE-2018-7159)**: The Node.js HTTP parser allowed for spaces inside
    `Content-Length` header values. Such values now lead to rejected
    connections in the same way as non-numeric values.
  * **Update root certificates**: 5 additional root certificates have
    been added to the Node.js binary and 30 have been removed.

  * cluster:
    - Add support for `NODE_OPTIONS="--inspect"` (Sameer Srivastava)
      https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19165
  * crypto:
    - Expose the public key of a certificate (Hannes Magnusson)
      https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/17690
  * n-api:
    - Add `napi_fatal_exception` to trigger an `uncaughtException` in
      JavaScript (Mathias Buus)
      https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19337
  * path:
    - Fix regression in `posix.normalize` (Michaël Zasso)
      https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19520
  * stream:
    - Improve stream creation performance (Brian White)
      https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/19401
  * Added new collaborators

  c3c9984605d9c3f895d1c54cd913187d500a2f76:2018-03-28, Version 9.10.0 (Current)

  This is a security release. All Node.js users should consult the
  security release summary at:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/

  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Fixes for the following CVEs are included in this release:

  * CVE-2018-7158
  * CVE-2018-7159
  * CVE-2018-7160

  Notable changes:

  * Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.2o: Does not contain any security fixes that
    are known to impact Node.js.
  * **Fix for inspector DNS rebinding vulnerability (CVE-2018-7160)**:
    A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick a web
    browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and allow HTTP
    connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network,
    potentially to an open inspector port as a debugger, therefore
    gaining full code execution access. The inspector now only allows
    connections that have a browser `Host` value of `localhost` or
    `localhost6`.
  * **Fix for `'path'` module regular expression denial of service
    (CVE-2018-7158)**: A regular expression used for parsing POSIX an
    Windows paths could be used to cause a denial of service if an
    attacker were able to have a specially crafted path string passed
    through one of the impacted `'path'` module functions.
  * **Reject spaces in HTTP `Content-Length` header values
    (CVE-2018-7159)**: The Node.js HTTP parser allowed for spaces inside
    `Content-Length` header values. Such values now lead to rejected
    connections in the same way as non-numeric values.
  * **Update root certificates**: 5 additional root certificates have
    been added to the Node.js binary and 30 have been removed.
