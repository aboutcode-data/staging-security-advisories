  Security Update

  Notable items:

  * **http**: Fix a bug where an HTTP socket may no longer have a socket
    but a pipelined request triggers a pause or resume, a potential
    denial-of-service vector. (Fedor Indutny)
  * **openssl**: Upgrade to 1.0.2e, containing fixes for:
    - CVE-2015-3193 "BN_mod_exp may produce incorrect results on x86_64",
      an attack is considered feasible against DH, an attack against RSA
      and DSA is considered possible but unlikely, EC algorithms are not
      affected. Details are available at
      <http://openssl.org/news/secadv/20151203.txt>.
    - CVE-2015-3194 "Certificate verify crash with missing PSS parameter",
      a potential denial-of-service vector for Node.js TLS servers; TLS
      clients are also impacted. Details are available at
      <http://openssl.org/news/secadv/20151203.txt>.
    (Shigeki Ohtsu) #4134
  * v8: Backport fixes for a bug in `JSON.stringify()` that can result
    in out-of-bounds reads for arrays. (Ben Noordhuis)
