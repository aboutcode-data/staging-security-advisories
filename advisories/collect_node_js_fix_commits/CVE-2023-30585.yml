  0ae8bf8dbc3d5db9a604c7be66aa22893e109fa0:msi: do not create AppData\Roaming\npm

  This effectively reverts e431cae7e70069cd1631081f9dca09990b948feb due to
  security concerns. The directory is being created with elevated
  privileges but its path may depend on an unprivileged user's environment
  variables. Creating a directory in certain sensitive locations can cause
  Windows to become inoperable.

  Creating AppData\Roaming\npm was an intentional addition in order to
  resolve https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/8141, which
  appears to have been a common issue for users of npm. However, this was
  implemented before 4cfe5eb9af9d0a46ab6bfe3a4a49c4b1e43513b0, which
  changed the MSI installation scope to perMachine. There were concerns
  about creating the npm directory in that PR, albeit not related to
  security (see https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/pull/25640).
