  for details on patched vulnerabilities.

  Notable Changes

  Semver Minor:

  * openssl:
    - Upgrade to 1.0.2i, fixes a number of defects impacting Node.js:
      CVE-2016-6304 ("OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory
      growth", high severity), CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6303,
      CVE-2016-2178 and CVE-2016-6306.
      (Shigeki Ohtsu) https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/8714
    - Upgrade to 1.0.2j, fixes a defect included in 1.0.2i resulting in
      a crash when using CRLs, CVE-2016-7052.
      (Shigeki Ohtsu) https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/8786
    - Remove support for loading dynamic third-party engine modules.
      An attacker may be able to hide malicious code to be inserted into
      Node.js at runtime by masquerading as one of the dynamic engine
      modules. Originally reported by Ahmed Zaki (Skype).
      (Ben Noordhuis) https://github.com/nodejs/node-private/pull/70
  * http: CVE-2016-5325 - Properly validate for allowable characters in
    the `reason` argument in `ServerResponse#writeHead()`. Fixes a
    possible response splitting attack vector. This introduces a new
    case where `throw` may occur when configuring HTTP responses, users
    should already be adopting try/catch here. Originally reported
    independently by Evan Lucas and Romain Gaucher.
    (Evan Lucas) https://github.com/nodejs/node-private/pull/46

  Semver Patch:

  * buffer: Zero-fill excess bytes in new `Buffer` objects created with
    `Buffer.concat()` while providing a `totalLength` parameter that
    exceeds the total length of the original `Buffer` objects being
    concatenated.
    (Сковорода Никита Андреевич) https://github.com/nodejs/node-private/pull/65
  * tls: CVE-2016-7099 - Fix invalid wildcard certificate validation
    check whereby a TLS server may be able to serve an invalid wildcard
    certificate for its hostname due to improper validation of `*.` in
    the wildcard string. Originally reported by Alexander Minozhenko and
    James Bunton (Atlassian).
    (Ben Noordhuis) https://github.com/nodejs/node-private/pull/63

    - Invalid status codes can no longer be sent. Limited to 3 digit
      numbers between 100 - 999. Lack of proper validation may also
      serve as a potential response splitting attack vector. Backported
      from v4.x. (Brian White)
