  fee5cde00be7342dc6c00d0b0a0276d09e5252e3:Fix tests for CVE-2018-6914

  Since the current working directory is not involved in `Tempfile`
  and `Dir.mktmpdir` (except for the last resort), it is incorrect
  to derive the traversal path from it.  Also, since the rubyspec
  temporary directory is created under the build directory, this is
  not involved in the target method.  Fixed sporadic errors in
  test-spec.
