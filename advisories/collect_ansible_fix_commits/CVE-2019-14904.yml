  a1b0f72c98b4b2afaab8aafa255e82c2075049c8:[2.9] solaris_zone: Allow only valid characters in zone name

  CVE-2019-14904 - solaris_zone module accepts zone name and performs actions related to that.
  However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions.
  A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands
  into the server manipulating the module behaviour.

  Adding user input validation as per Solaris Zone documentation fixes this issue.
