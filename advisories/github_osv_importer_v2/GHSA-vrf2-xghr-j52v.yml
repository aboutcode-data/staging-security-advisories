  ### Impact

  Private files publicly accessible with Cloud Storage providers when the hashed URL is known

  ### Patches

  We recommend first changing your configuration to set the correct visibility according to the documentation. The visibility must be at the same level as `type`.

  When the Storage is saved on Amazon AWS we recommending disabling public access to the bucket containing the private files: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html

  Otherwise, update to Shopware 6.4.1.1 or install or update the Security plugin (https://store.shopware.com/en/detail/index/sArticle/518463/number/Swag136939272659) and run the command `./bin/console s3:set-visibility` to correct your cloud file visibilities
