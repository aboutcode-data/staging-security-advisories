  - CVE-2020-15168
summary: |
  The `size` option isn't honored after following a redirect in node-fetch
  ### Impact
  Node Fetch did not honor the `size` option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a `FetchError` would never get thrown and the process would end without failure.

  For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after `fetch()` has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.

  ### Patches
  We released patched versions for both stable and beta channels:

  - For `v2`: 2.6.1
  - For `v3`: 3.0.0-beta.9

  ### Workarounds
  None, it is strongly recommended to update as soon as possible.
