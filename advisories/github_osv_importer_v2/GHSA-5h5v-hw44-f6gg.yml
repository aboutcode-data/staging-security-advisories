aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34712
summary: |
  Oceanic allows unsanitized user input to lead to path traversal in URLs
  ### Impact
  Input to functions such as `Client.rest.channels.removeBan` is not url-encoded, resulting in specially crafted input such as `../../../channels/{id}` being normalized into the url `/api/v10/channels/{id}`, and deleting a channel rather than removing a ban.

  ### Workarounds
  * Sanitizing user input, ensuring strings are valid for the purpose they are being used for.
  * Encoding input with `encodeURIComponent` before providing it to the library.
