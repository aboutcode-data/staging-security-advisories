aliases:
  - CVE-2019-10767
summary: |
  Arbitrary File Write in iobroker.js-controller
  Versions of `iobroker.controller` prior to 2.0.25 are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended `/adapter/<adapter-name>` folder, which may allow attackers to include arbitrary files in the system. An attacker would need to be authenticated to perform the attack but the package has authentication disabled by default.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.0.25 or later.
