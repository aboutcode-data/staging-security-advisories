summary: "node-forge is vulnerable to ASN.1 OID Integer Truncation\n### Summary\n\n**MITRE-Formatted\
  \ CVE Description**\nAn Integer Overflow (CWE-190) vulnerability in node-forge versions 1.3.1\
  \ and below enables remote, unauthenticated attackers to craft ASN.1 structures containing\
  \ OIDs with oversized arcs. These arcs may be decoded as smaller, trusted OIDs due to 32-bit\
  \ bitwise truncation, enabling the bypass of downstream OID-based security decisions.\n\n\
  ### Description\n\nAn ASN.1 OID Integer Truncation vulnerability exists in the node-forge\
  \ `asn1.derToOid` function within `forge/lib/asn1.js`. OID components are decoded using JavaScript's\
  \ bitwise left-shift operator (`<<`), which forcibly casts values to 32-bit signed integers.\
  \ Consequently, if an attacker provides a mathematically unique, very large OID arc integer\
  \ exceeding $2^{31}-1$, the value silently overflows and wraps around rather than throwing\
  \ an error. \n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows a specially crafted ASN.1 object to\
  \ spoof an OID, where a malicious certificate with a massive, invalid OID is misinterpreted\
  \ by the library as a trusted, standard OID, potentially bypassing security controls.\n\n\
  This vulnerability impacts the `asn1.derToOid` function in `node-forge` before patched version\
  \ `1.3.2`. \n\nAny downstream application using this component is impacted. This component\
  \ may be leveraged by downstream applications in ways that enables partial compromise of integrity,\
  \ leading to potential availability and confidentiality compromises."
