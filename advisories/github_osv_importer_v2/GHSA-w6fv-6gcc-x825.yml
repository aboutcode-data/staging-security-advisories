summary: |
  Zincati allows unprivileged access to rpm-ostree D-Bus `Deploy()` and `FinalizeDeployment()` methods
  ### Impact

  Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the following actions:
  - `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy`: used to deploy updates to the system
  - `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment`: used to reboot the system into the deployed update

  Since Zincati [v0.0.24](https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.24), this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user.

  In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload.

  This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket.

  ### Patches

  The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. The fix is included in the following FCOS releases:
  - On the `stable` stream: 41.20250302.3.2
  - On the `testing` stream: 41.20250315.2.0
  - On the `next` stream: 42.20250316.1.0

  ### Workarounds

  A workaround is to add the following polkit rule:

  ```javascript
  polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
      if (action.id == "org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy" ||
          action.id == "org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment" ||
          action.id == "org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.cleanup") {
          if (subject.user != "zincati") {
                  return polkit.Result.NO;
          }
      }
  });
  ```

  to e.g. `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/00-zincati-fix.rules` (it must sort earlier than `zincati.rules` lexicographically).

  Note that this rule will deny all non-root users other than `zincati` from using those actions. If you've added polkit rules to allow e.g. the `core` user or other users, you will need to adjust the policy (or make sure the ordering is appropriate).
