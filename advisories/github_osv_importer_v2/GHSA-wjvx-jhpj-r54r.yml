summary: "sagemaker-python-sdk vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n### Impact\n\
  \nsagemaker.base_deserializers.NumpyDeserializer module before v2.218.0 allows potentially\
  \ unsafe deserialization when untrusted data is passed as pickled object arrays. This consequently\
  \ may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service,\
  \ affecting both confidentiality and integrity.\n\nImpacted versions: <2.218.0.\n\n### Credit\
  \ \n\nWe would like to thank HiddenLayer for collaborating on this issue through the coordinated\
  \ vulnerability disclosure process.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not pass pickled numpy object\
  \ arrays which originated from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with.\
  \ Only pass pickled numpy object arrays from sources you trust.\n\n\n### References\n\nIf\
  \ you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that you contact AWS/Amazon\
  \ Security via our vulnerability reporting page [1] or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\
  \ Please do not create a public GitHub issue.\n[1] Vulnerability reporting page: https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting\n\
