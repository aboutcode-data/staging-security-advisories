summary: "Path traversal in spotipy\n### Summary\nIf a malicious URI is passed to the library,\
  \ the library can be tricked into performing an operation on a different API endpoint than\
  \ intended.\n\n### Details\nThe [code Spotipy uses to parse URIs and URLs ](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/client.py#L1942)\
  \ accepts user data too liberally which allows a malicious user to insert arbitrary characters\
  \ into the path that is used for API requests. Because it is possible to include `..`, an\
  \ attacker can redirect for example a track lookup via `spotifyApi.track()` to an arbitrary\
  \ API endpoint like playlists, but this is possible for other endpoints as well.\n\nBefore\
  \ the security advisory feature was enabled on GitHub, I was already in contact with Stéphane\
  \ Bruckert via e-mail, and he asked me to look into a potential fix. \n\nMy recommendation\
  \ is to perform stricter parsing of URLs and URIs, which I implemented in the patch included\
  \ at the end of the report. If you prefer, I can also invite you to a private fork of the\
  \ repository.\n\n### Impact\nThe impact of this vulnerability depends heavily on what operations\
  \ a client application performs when it handles a URI from a user and how it uses the responses\
  \ it receives from the API."
