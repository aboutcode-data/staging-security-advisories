  Hono added timing comparison hardening in basicAuth and bearerAuth
  ## Summary

  The `basicAuth` and `bearerAuth` middlewares previously used a comparison that was not fully timing-safe.

  The `timingSafeEqual` function used normal string equality (`===`) when comparing hash values. This comparison may stop early if values differ, which can theoretically cause small timing differences.

  The implementation has been updated to use a safer comparison method.


  ## Details

  The issue was caused by the use of normal string equality (`===`) when comparing hash values inside the `timingSafeEqual` function.

  In JavaScript, string comparison may stop as soon as a difference is found. This means the comparison time can slightly vary depending on how many characters match.

  Under very specific and controlled conditions, this behavior could theoretically allow timing-based analysis.

  The implementation has been updated to:

  - Avoid early termination during comparison
  - Use a constant-time-style comparison method

  ## Impact

  This issue is unlikely to be exploited in normal environments.

  It may only be relevant in highly controlled situations where precise timing measurements are possible.

  This change is considered a security hardening improvement. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version.
