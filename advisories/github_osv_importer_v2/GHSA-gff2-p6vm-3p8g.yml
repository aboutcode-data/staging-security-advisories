  ZendFramework potential remote code execution in zend-mail via Sendmail adapter
  When using the zend-mail component to send email via the `Zend\Mail\Transport\Sendmail transport`, a malicious user may be able to inject arbitrary parameters to the system sendmail program. The attack is performed by providing additional quote characters within an address; when unsanitized, they can be interpreted as additional command line arguments, leading to the vulnerability.
