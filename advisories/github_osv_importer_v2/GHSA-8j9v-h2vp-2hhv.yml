aliases:
  - CVE-2020-26293
summary: |
  XSS in HtmlSanitizer
  ### Impact

  If you have explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed in version 5.0.372.

  ### Workarounds

  Remove the `<style>` tag from the set of allowed tags.
