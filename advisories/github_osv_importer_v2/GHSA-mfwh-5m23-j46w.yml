  - CVE-2020-15228
summary: "Environment Variable Injection in GitHub Actions\n### Impact\nThe `@actions/core`\
  \ npm module `addPath` and `exportVariable` functions communicate with the Actions Runner\
  \ over stdout by generating a string in a specific format. Workflows that log untrusted data\
  \ to stdout may invoke these commands, resulting in the path or environment variables being\
  \ modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. \n\n### Patches\nThe runner\
  \ will release an update that disables the `set-env` and `add-path` workflow commands in the\
  \ near future. For now, users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.2.6` or later, and replace\
  \ any instance of the `set-env` or `add-path` commands in their workflows with the new [Environment\
  \ File Syntax](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/commands.md#environment-files).\
  \ Workflows and actions using the old commands or older versions of the toolkit will start\
  \ to warn, then error out during workflow execution.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone, it is strongly\
  \ suggested that you upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have\
  \ any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Actions Toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues)"
