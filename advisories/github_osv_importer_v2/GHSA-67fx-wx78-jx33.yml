  - CVE-2022-23526
summary: "Helm vulnerable to denial of service through schema file\nFuzz testing, by Ada Logics\
  \ and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the `_chartutil_` package that\
  \ can cause a segmentation violation. Applications that use functions from the `_chartutil_`\
  \ package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and\
  \ it panics.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `_chartutil_` package contains a parser that loads a JSON\
  \ Schema validation file. For example, the Helm client when rendering a chart will validate\
  \ its values with the schema file. The `_chartutil_` package parses the schema file and loads\
  \ it into structures Go can work with. Some schema files can cause array data structures to\
  \ be created causing a memory violation.\n\nApplications that use the `_chartutil_` package\
  \ in the Helm SDK to parse a schema file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes\
  \ a panic that cannot be recovered from.\n\nThe Helm Client will panic with a schema file\
  \ that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will\
  \ not affect future uses of the Helm client.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved\
  \ in 3.10.3. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nSDK users can validate schema files that are correctly\
  \ formatted before passing them to the `_chartutil_` functions.\n\n### For more information\n\
  \nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ document.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF."
