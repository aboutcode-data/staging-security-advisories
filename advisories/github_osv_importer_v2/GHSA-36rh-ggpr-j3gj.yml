summary: "Renovate vulnerable to Azure DevOps token leakage in logs\n### Impact\n\nApplies to\
  \ Azure DevOps users only. The bot's token may be exposed in server or pipeline logs due to\
  \ the `http.extraheader=AUTHORIZATION` parameter being logged without redaction. It is recommended\
  \ that Azure DevOps users revoke their existing bot credentials and generate new ones after\
  \ upgrading if there's a potential that logs have been saved to a location that others can\
  \ view.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in \n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not share Renovate logs with\
  \ anyone who cannot be trusted with access to the token."
