  cart2quote/module-quotation-encoded Remote Code Execution via downloadCustomOptionAction
  cart2quote/module-quotation-encoded extension may expose a critical security vulnerability by utilizing the unserialize function when processing data from a GET request. This flaw, present in the app/code/community/Ophirah/Qquoteadv/controllers/DownloadController.php and app/code/community/Ophirah/Qquoteadv/Helper/Data.php files, poses a significant risk of Remote Code Execution, especially when custom file options are employed on a product. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code remotely, leading to unauthorized access and potential compromise of sensitive data.
