summary: "Contrast's unauthenticated recovery allows Coordinator impersonation\n### Impact\n\
  \nRecovering coordinators do not verify the seed provided by the recovering party. This allows\
  \ an attacker to set up a coordinator with a manifest that passes validation, but with a secret\
  \ seed controlled by the attacker. \n\nIf network traffic is redirected from the legitimate\
  \ coordinator to the attacker's coordinator, a workload owner is susceptible to impersonation\
  \ if either \n\n* they `set` a new manifest and don't compare the root CA cert with the existing\
  \ one (this is the default of the `contrast` CLI) or\n* they `verify` the coordinator and\
  \ don't compare the root CA cert with a trusted reference.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the\
  \ attacker can:\n\n* Issue certificates that chain back to the attacker coordinator's root\
  \ CA.\n* Recover arbitrary workload secrets of workloads deployed after the attack.\n\nThis\
  \ issue does **not** affect the following:\n\n* secrets of the legitimate coordinator (seed,\
  \ workload secrets, CA)\n* integrity of workloads, even when used with the rogue coordinator\n\
  * certificates chaining back to the mesh CA\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is patched in Contrast\
  \ v1.4.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue can be avoided by verifying the coordinator root\
  \ CA cert against expectations.\n\n* At the first `set` call, keep a copy of the CA cert returned\
  \ by the coordinator.\n* After subsequent `set` or `verify` calls, compare the returned CA\
  \ cert with the backup copy. If it matches bit-for-bit, the coordinator is legitimate."
