summary: "Possible ORM Leak Vulnerability in the Harbor\n### Impact\n\nAdministrator users on\
  \ Harbor could exploit an ORM Leak (https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/)\
  \ vulnerability that was present in the `/api/v2.0/users` endpoint to leak users' password\
  \ hash and salt values. This vulnerability was introduced into the application because the\
  \ `q` URL parameter allowed the administrator to filter users by any column, and the filter\
  \ `password=~` could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character by character.\n\
  \nAn attacker with administrator access could exploit this vulnerability to leak highly sensitive\
  \ information stored on the Harbor database, as demonstrated in the attached writeup by the\
  \ leaking of users' password hashes and salts. All endpoints that support the `q` URL parameter\
  \ are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack, and could potentially be exploitable by lower privileged\
  \ users to gain unauthorised access to other sensitive information. \n\n\n### Patches\nNo\
  \ available\n\n### Workarounds\nNA\n\n### References\n\n### Credit\nalex@elttam.com"
