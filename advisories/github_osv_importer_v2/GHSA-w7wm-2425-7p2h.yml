  MarbleRun unauthenticated recovery allows Coordinator impersonation
  ### Impact

  During recovery, a Coordinator only verifies that a given recovery key decrypts the sealed state, not if this key was provided by a party with access to one of the recovery keys defined in the manifest.
  This allows an attacker to manually craft a sealed state using their own recovery keys, and a manifest that does not match the rest of the state.

  If network traffic is redirected from the legitimate coordinator to the attacker's Coordinator, a remote party is susceptible to impersonation if they verify the Coordinator without comparing the root certificate of the Coordinator against a trusted reference.

  Under these circumstances, an attacker can trick a remote party into trusting the malicious Coordinator by presenting a manifest that does not match the actual state of the deployment.

  This issue does **not** affect the following:

  * secrets and state of the legitimate Coordinator instances
  * integrity of workloads
  * certificates chaining back to the legitimate Coordinator root certificate

  ### Patches

  The issue has been patched in [`v1.7.0`](https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/tag/v1.7.0).

  ### Workarounds

  Connections that purely authenticate based on a known Coordinator's root certificate, e.g. the one retrieved when using the `marblerun manifest set` CLI command, are not affected.
