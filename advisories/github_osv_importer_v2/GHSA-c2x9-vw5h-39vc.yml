  - CVE-2024-27894
summary: "Apache Pulsar: Pulsar Functions Worker Allows Unauthorized File Access and Unauthorized\
  \ HTTP/HTTPS Proxying\nThe Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits authenticated\
  \ users to create functions where the function's implementation is referenced by a URL. The\
  \ supported URL schemes include \"file\", \"http\", and \"https\". When a function is created\
  \ using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided\
  \ by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an\
  \ attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process\
  \ has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially\
  \ includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage\
  \ this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of\
  \ remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service\
  \ attacks.\nThis vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with\
  \ \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\".\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0\
  \ to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. \n\
  \n2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.\n2.11 Pulsar Function\
  \ Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.\n3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should\
  \ upgrade to at least 3.0.3.\n3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least\
  \ 3.1.3.\n3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.\n\nUsers operating\
  \ versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions\
  \ or newer versions.\n\nThe updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default,\
  \ impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this\
  \ functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: \"additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns\"\
  \ and \"additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns\". These keys allow users to specify a set of\
  \ URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match\
  \ the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those\
  \ who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation."
