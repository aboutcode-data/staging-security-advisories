summary: |
  Generated code can read and write out of bounds in safe code
  Code generated by flatbuffers' compiler is `unsafe` but not marked as such.
  See https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/6627 for details.

  All users that use generated code by `flatbuffers` compiler are recommended to:
  1. not expose flatbuffer generated code as part of their public APIs
  2. audit their code and look for any usage of `follow`, `push`, or any method that uses them
     (e.g. `self_follow`).
  3. Carefuly go through the crates' documentation to understand which "safe" APIs are not
     intended to be used.
