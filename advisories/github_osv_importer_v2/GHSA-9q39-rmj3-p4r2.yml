summary: "HTML injection in Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab leading to DOM Clobbering\n### Impact\n\
  \nThe vulnerability depends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown\
  \ cells, or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature.\n\nA malicious user can access\
  \ any data that the attacked user has access to as well as perform arbitrary requests acting\
  \ as the attacked user.\n\n### Patches\n\nJupyterLab v3.6.8, v4.2.5 and Jupyter Notebook v7.2.2\
  \ were patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround for the underlying DOM Clobbering\
  \ susceptibility. However, select plugins can be disabled on deployments which cannot update\
  \ in a timely fashion to minimise the risk. These are:\n- `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin`\
  \ - users will loose ability to preview mathematical equations \n- `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin`\
  \ - users will loose ability to open Markdown previews\n- `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin`\
  \ (if installed with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package) - an older version of the mathjax\
  \ plugin for JupyterLab 4.x\n\nTo disable these extensions run:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension\
  \ disable @jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin\njupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin\n\
  jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin\n```\n\nTo confirm that\
  \ the plugins were disabled run:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension list\n```\n\n### References\n\
  \nNone\n\n### Notes\n\nThis change has a potential to break rendering of some markdown. There\
  \ is a setting in Sanitizer which allows to revert to the previous sanitizer settings (`allowNamedProperties`)."
