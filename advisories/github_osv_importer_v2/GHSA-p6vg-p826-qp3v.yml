summary: |
  URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in fastify-static
  ### Impact

  A redirect vulnerability in the `fastify-static` module allows remote attackers to redirect Mozilla Firefox users to arbitrary websites via a double slash `//` followed by a domain: `http://localhost:3000//google.com/%2e%2e`.

  The issue shows up on all the `fastify-static` applications that set `redirect: true` option. By default, it is `false`.

  ### Patches
  The issue has been patched in `fastify-static@4.2.4`

  ### Workarounds
  If updating is not an option, you can sanitize the input URLs using the [`rewriteUrl`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Server/#rewriteurl) server option.
