  - CVE-2022-39394
summary: |
  wasmtime_trap_code C API function has out of bounds write vulnerability
  ### Impact

  There is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a 1-byte buffer provided by the caller. This can lead to three zero bytes being written beyond the 1-byte location provided by the caller.

  ### Patches

  This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.

  ### Workarounds

  This can be worked around by providing a 4-byte buffer casted to a 1-byte buffer when calling `wasmtime_trap_code`. Users of the `wasmtime` crate are not affected by this issue, only users of the C API function `wasmtime_trap_code` are affected.
