summary: "Label Studio allows Server-Side Request Forgery in the S3 Storage Endpoint\n## Description\n\
  Label Studio's S3 storage integration feature contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\
  \ vulnerability in its endpoint configuration. When creating an S3 storage connection, the\
  \ application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter.\
  \ This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions\
  \ on the protocol or destination.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application\
  \ send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint.\
  \ When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls\
  \ to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning\
  \ the response in error messages.\n\nThis SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network\
  \ segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external\
  \ network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests\
  \ contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration from internal services.\n\n##\
  \ Steps to reproduce\n1. Create an account in Label Studio\n\n2. Create a new project with\
  \ basic configuration\n\n3. Create an S3 storage connection with the following configuration:\n\
  \   ```json\n   {\n     \"project\": 1,\n     \"title\": \"Test Storage\",\n     \"bucket\"\
  : \"<filename>\",\n     \"s3_endpoint\": \"http://internal-web\",\n     \"use_blob_urls\"\
  : true,\n     \"aws_access_key_id\": \"test\",\n     \"aws_secret_access_key\": \"test\"\n\
  \   }\n   ```\n4. Trigger a storage sync operation by sending a POST request to `/api/storages/s3/[storage_id]/sync`\n\
  \nThe application will attempt to connect to the specified endpoint URL as if it were an S3\
  \ service. When the request fails due to invalid S3 API responses, the error message will\
  \ contain the raw response from the internal service, allowing access to internal resources.\n\
  \   \n## Mitigations\n- Implement strict validation of S3 endpoint URLs to allow only valid\
  \ S3service endpoints\n- Add an allowlist of endpoint domains and protocols\n- Sanitize error\
  \ messages to prevent leakage of sensitive information from failed requests\n- Consider implementing\
  \ network-level controls to restrict outbound connections from the application server\n\n\
  ## Impact\nThis vulnerability has high severity as it allows authenticated users to make requests\
  \ to arbitrary internal services from the application server, potentially exposing sensitive\
  \ internal resources and bypassing network segmentation. The inclusion of response data in\
  \ error messages makes this particularly effective for data exfiltration."
