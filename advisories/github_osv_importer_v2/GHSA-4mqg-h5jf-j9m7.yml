  TorchServe Pre-Auth Remote Code Execution
  ## Impact

  **Use of Open Source Library potentially exposed to RCE**
      **Issue**: Use of a version of the SnakeYAML `v1.31 `open source library with multiple issues that potentially exposes the user to unsafe deserialization of Java objects. This could allow third parties to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This issue is present in versions `0.3.0` to `0.8.1`.
      **Mitigation**: A pull request to address this issue has been merged - https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2523. TorchServe release `0.8.2` includes this fix.

  ## Patches

  ## TorchServe release 0.8.2 includes fixes to address the previously listed issue:
