summary: |
  Rancher's Failure to delete orphaned role bindings does not revoke project level access from group based authentication
  ### Impact
  This vulnerability only affects customers using group based authentication in Rancher versions up to and including 2.4.17, 2.5.11 and 2.6.2.

  When removing a Project Role associated to a group from a project, the bindings that grant access to cluster scoped resources for those subjects do not get deleted. This happens due to an incomplete authorization logic check. A user who is a member of an affected group with authenticated access to Rancher could use this to access resources they should no longer have access to. The exposure level will depend on the original permission level granted to the affected project role.

  ### Patches
  Patched versions include releases 2.4.18, 2.5.12, 2.6.3 and later versions.

  ### Workarounds
  Limit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.
