  UUPSUpgradeable vulnerability in @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
  ### Impact

  Upgradeable contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` may be vulnerable to an attack affecting uninitialized implementation contracts. We will update this advisory with more information soon.

  ### Patches

  A fix is included in version 4.3.2 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.

  ### Workarounds

  Initialize implementation contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` by invoking the initializer function (usually called `initialize`). An example is provided [in the forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301).

  ### References

  A post-mortem will be published in a few days in the [OpenZeppelin Forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/).
