summary: "melange affected by potential host command execution via license-check YAML mode patch\
  \ pipeline\nAn attacker who can influence inputs to the patch pipeline could execute arbitrary\
  \ shell commands on the build host. The patch pipeline in pkg/build/pipelines/patch.yaml embeds\
  \ input-derived values (series paths, patch filenames, and numeric parameters) into shell\
  \ scripts without proper quoting or validation, allowing shell metacharacters to break out\
  \ of their intended context.                                                             \
  \                                                                                        \

  \                    \nThe vulnerability affects the built-in patch pipeline which can be\
  \ invoked through melange build and melange license-check operations. An attacker who can\
  \ control patch-related inputs (e.g., through pull request-driven CI, build-as-a-service,\
  \ or by influencing melange configurations) can inject shell metacharacters such as backticks,\
  \ command substitutions  $(…), semicolons, pipes, or redirections to execute arbitrary commands\
  \ with the privileges of the melange build process.                                      \
  \                        \n\nFix: Fixed in [bd132535](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/commit/bd132535cd9f57d4bd39d9ead0633598941af030)\
