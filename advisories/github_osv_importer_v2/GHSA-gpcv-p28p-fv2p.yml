summary: |
  odoh-rs's Invalid Slice Split Results in Server Panic
  A vulnerability was discovered in the odoh-rs rust crate that stems from faulty logic during the parsing of encrypted queries. This issue specifically occurs when processing encrypted query data received from remote clients.

  ### Impact
  An attacker with knowledge of this vulnerability could craft and send specially designed encrypted queries to targeted ODOH servers running with odoh-rs. Upon successful exploitation, the server will crash abruptly, disrupting its normal operation and rendering the service temporarily unavailable.

  ### Patches
  Users are encouraged to update their odoh-rs's rust crate to v1.0.2.
