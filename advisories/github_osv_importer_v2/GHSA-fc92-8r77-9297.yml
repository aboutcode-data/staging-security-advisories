summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability in Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin
  Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.

  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

  Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.
