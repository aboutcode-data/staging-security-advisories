summary: |
  Flask vulnerable to possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary: Cookie header
  When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by a proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session, and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on _all_ these conditions being met.

  1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
  2. The application sets [`session.permanent = True`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/api/#flask.session.permanent).
  2. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
  4. [`SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/config/#SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST) is enabled (the default).
  5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.

  This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.
