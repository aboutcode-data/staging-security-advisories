summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in go-ipfs-dep\nAffected versions of `go-ipfs-deps`\
  \ insecurely download resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged\
  \ network position, they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity\
  \ of impact for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of\
  \ the package itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all the way\
  \ up to and including remote code execution.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.4.4\
  \ or later."
