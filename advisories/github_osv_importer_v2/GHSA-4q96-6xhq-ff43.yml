aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15275
summary: |
  malicious SVG attachment causing stored XSS vulnerability
  ### Impact
  An attacker with `write` permissions can upload an SVG file that contains malicious javascript. This javascript will be executed in a user's browser when the user is viewing that SVG file on the wiki.

  ### Patches
  Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version.

  MoinMoin Wiki 1.9.11 has the necessary fixes and also contains other important fixes.

  ### Workarounds
  It is not advised to work around this, but to upgrade MoinMoin to a patched version.

  That said, a work around via a Content Security Policy in the web server might be possible.

  Also, it is of course helpful if you give `write` permissions (which include uploading attachments) only to trusted users.
