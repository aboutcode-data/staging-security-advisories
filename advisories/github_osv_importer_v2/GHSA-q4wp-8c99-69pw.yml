aliases:
  - CVE-2021-21670
summary: |
  Improper permission checks allow canceling queue items and aborting builds in Jenkins
  Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.

  Jenkins 2.300, LTS 2.289.2 requires that users have Item/Read permission for applicable types in addition to Item/Cancel permission.

  As a workaround on earlier versions of Jenkins, do not grant Item/Cancel permission to users who do not have Item/Read permission.
