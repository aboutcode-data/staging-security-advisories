  - CVE-2024-52296
summary: |
  LibOSDP vulnerable to a null pointer deref in osdp_reply_name
  ### Issue:
  At ospd_common.c, on the osdp_reply_name function, any reply id between REPLY_ACK and REPLY_XRD is valid, but names array do not declare all of the range. On a case of an undefined reply id within the range, name will be null (`name = names[reply_id - REPLY_ACK];`). Null name will casue a crash on next line: `if (name[0] == '\0')` as null[0] is invalid.

  ### Attack:
  As this logic is not limited to a secure connection, attacker may trigger this vulnerability without any prior knowledge.

  ### Impact
  Denial of Service

  ### Patch
  The issue has been patched in 24409e98a260176765956ec766a04cb35984fab1
