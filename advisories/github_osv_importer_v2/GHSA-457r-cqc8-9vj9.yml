  sweetalert2 v10.16.10 and above contains hidden functionality
  `sweetalert2` versions 10.16.10 and up until 11.0.0 are vulnerable to hidden functionality that was introduced by the maintainer. The package outputs audio and/or video messages that do not pertain to the functionality of the package and is not included in versions 10.0.0 - 10.16.9.

  ### Workaround
  Use a version 10.0.0 - 10.16.9 of the package until the maintainer releases a fix.
