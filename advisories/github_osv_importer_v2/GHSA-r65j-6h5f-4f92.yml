  Withdrawn: JJWT improperly generates signing keys
  ## Withdrawn Advisory

  This advisory has been withdrawn because it has been found to be disputed. Please see the issue [here](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/930#issuecomment-2032699358) for more information.

  ## Original Description

  JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class.
