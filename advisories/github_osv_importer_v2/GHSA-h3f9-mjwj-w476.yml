  - CVE-2026-26325
summary: |
  OpenClaw Node host system.run rawCommand/command mismatch can bypass allowlist/approvals
  ## Summary

  A mismatch between `rawCommand` and `command[]` in the node host `system.run` handler could cause allowlist/approval evaluation to be performed on one command while executing a different argv.

  ## Affected Configurations

  This only impacts deployments that:

  - Use the node host / companion node execution path (`system.run` on a node).
  - Enable allowlist-based exec policy (`security=allowlist`) with approval prompting driven by allowlist misses (for example `ask=on-miss`).
  - Allow an attacker to invoke `system.run`.

  Default/non-node configurations are not affected.

  ## Impact

  In affected configurations, an attacker who can invoke `system.run` can bypass allowlist enforcement and approval prompts by supplying an allowlisted `rawCommand` while providing a different `command[]` argv for execution.

  ## Affected Packages / Versions

  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.13`
  - Patched version: `>= 2026.2.14` (planned next release)

  ## Fix

  Enforce `rawCommand`/`command[]` consistency (gateway fail-fast + node host validation).

  ## Fix Commit(s)

  - cb3290fca32593956638f161d9776266b90ab891

  ## Release Process Note

  This advisory pre-sets the patched version to the planned next release (`2026.2.14`). Once `openclaw@2026.2.14` is published to npm, the advisory can be published without further edits.

  Thanks @christos-eth for reporting.
