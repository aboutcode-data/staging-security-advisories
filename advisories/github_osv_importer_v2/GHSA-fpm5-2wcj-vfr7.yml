summary: "codechecker authentication method confusion vulnerability allows logging in as the\
  \ built-in root user from an external service\n### Summary\nAuthentication method confusion\
  \ allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external service. The built-in root\
  \ user is generated in a weak manner, cannot be disabled, and has universal access. \n\n###\
  \ Details\nUntil CodeChecker version 6.24.1 there was an auto-generated super-user account\
  \ that could not be disabled.\nThe attacker needs to know only the username of the root user.\n\
  \nThis root user is unconditionally assigned superuser permissions.\n\nWhich means that if\
  \ any user via any service logs in with the root user's username, they will unconditionally\
  \ have superuser permissions on the CodeChecker instance.\n\nThe name of the user name can\
  \ be found in `root.user` file in the CodeChecker configuration directory.\nYou can check\
  \ if you are impacted by checking the existence of this user in the external authentication\
  \ services (e.g. LDAP, PAM etc.).\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker who\
  \ can create an account on an enabled external authentication service, to log in as the root\
  \ user, and access and control everything that can be controlled via the web interface.\n\
  The attacker needs to acquire the username of the root user to be successful."
