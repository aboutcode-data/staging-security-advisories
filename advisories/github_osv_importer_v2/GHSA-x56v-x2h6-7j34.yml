  - CVE-2025-54795
summary: "Claude Code echo command allowed bypass of user approval prompt for command execution\n\
  Due to an error in command parsing, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation\
  \ prompt to trigger execution of an untrusted command. Reliably exploiting this requires the\
  \ ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. \n\nUsers on standard\
  \ Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically after release. Current users of\
  \ Claude Code are unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated and have been forced\
  \ to update.\n\nThank you to Elad Beber (Cymulate) for reporting this issue!"
