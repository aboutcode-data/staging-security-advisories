  Go package github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun CLI commands susceptible to MITM attacks
  ### Impact
  Any CLI command issued to a Coordinator after the Manifest has been set, is susceptible to be redirected to another MarbleRun Coordinator instance, which runs the same binary, but potentially a different manifest.

  ### Patches
   The issue has been patched in [`v1.4.0`](https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

  ### Workarounds

  Directly using the REST API of the Coordinator and manually verifying and pinning the certificate to a set Manifest avoids the issue.
