aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31669
summary: |
  ### Impact
  Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating tag immutability policies - API call:

    PUT /projects/{project_name_or_id}/immutabletagrules/{immutable_rule_id}

  By sending a request to update a tag immutability policy with an id that belongs to a
  project that the currently authenticated user doesn’t have access to, the attacker could
  modify tag immutability policies configured in other projects.

  ### Patches
  This and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no workarounds available.
