summary: |
  teler dashboard vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS)
  ### Description

  teler prior to version <= 2.0.0-rc.4 is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) in the teler dashboard. When teler requests messages from the event stream on the `/events` endpoint, the log data displayed on the dashboard are not sanitized.

  ### Impact

  This only affects authenticated users and can only be exploited based on detected threats if the log contains a DOM scripting payload. This indicates a low severity and there is no significant impact on the users.

  ### Affected Version

  This issue was introduced from version `v2.0.0-rc` to `v2.0.0-rc.3` & `v2.0.0-dev`.

  ### Patches

  This vulnerability has been fixed on version `v2.0.0-rc.4` & `v2.0.0-dev.2`.

  ### Workarounds

  Here are some workarounds to handle this case:
  - Deactivate the live event dashboard from the configuration file, or
  - Upgrade teler version to `v2.0.0-rc.4` or `v2.0.0-dev.2` & above.
