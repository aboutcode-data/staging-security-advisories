summary: "restforce vulnerable to Improper Input Validation\nA flaw in how restforce constructs\
  \ URLs may allow an attacker to inject additional parameters into Salesforce API requests.\
  \   \n\nImpact\n------\nThis flaw is only exploitable in applications that pass user input\
  \ directly to restforce's select, find, describe, update, upsert, and destroy methods. \n\n\
  Vulnerable code might look like:\n```ruby\n  client.select('SomeSalesForceObject', params[:some-id],\n\
  \     ...)\n```\n\nIn such an application, attackers could pass `0016000000MRatd/describe`\
  \  as a request parameter, causing the server to make a request to a different endpoint than\
  \ the server is designed to handle. Since the Salesforce REST API supports overriding HTTP\
  \ methods via a request parameter, an attacker could also cause the client's `select()` method\
  \ to modify data, by passing `0016000000MRatd/?_HttpMethod=PATCH&other-query-params=...`.\n\
  \nWorkarounds\n------\nIf possible, applications should track salesforce IDs internally, rather\
  \ than passing user-supplied IDs to salesforce. Such practice mitigates this vulnerability,\
  \ and in general is desirable for ensuring strong access control."
