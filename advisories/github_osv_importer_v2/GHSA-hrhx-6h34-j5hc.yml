aliases:
  - CVE-2022-23632
summary: |
  Skip the router TLS configuration when the host header is an FQDN
  ### Impact

  People that configure mTLS between Traefik and clients.

  For a request, the TLS configuration choice can be different than the router choice, which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration.

  - When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration, the TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the configured one.

  - If the CNAME flattening is enabled, the selected TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value, so this can skip the expected TLS configuration.

  ### Patches

  Traefik v2.6.x: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.6.1

  ### Workarounds

  Add the FDQN to the host rule:

  Example:

  ```yml
    whoami:
      image: traefik/whoami:v1.7.1
      labels:
        traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule: Host(`whoami.example.com`, `whoami.example.com.`)
        traefik.http.routers.whoami.tls: true
        traefik.http.routers.whoami.tls.options: mtls@file
  ```

  There is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.
