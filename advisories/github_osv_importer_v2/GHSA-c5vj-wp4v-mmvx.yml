  - CVE-2023-33265
summary: |
  Hazelcast Executor Services don't check client permissions properly
  ### Impact
  In Hazelcast Platform, 5.0 through 5.0.4, 5.1 through 5.1.6, and 5.2 through 5.2.3, and Hazelcast IMDG (all versions up to 4.2.z), Executor Services don't check client permissions properly, allowing authenticated users to execute tasks on members without the required permissions granted.

  ### Patches
  Fix versions: 5.3.0, 5.2.4, 5.1.7, 5.0.5

  ### Workarounds
  Users are only affected when they already use executor services (i.e., an instance exists as a distributed data structure).
