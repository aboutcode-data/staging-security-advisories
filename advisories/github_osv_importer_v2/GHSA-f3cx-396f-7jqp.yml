summary: |
  Livewire Remote Code Execution on File Uploads
  In livewire/livewire prior to `v2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension.
  If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack:

  - Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`
  - Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk
  - Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files

  ### PoC
  In the following scenario, an attacker could upload a file called `shell.php` with an `image/png` MIME type and execute it on the remote server.
  ```php
  class SomeComponent extends Component
  {
      use WithFileUploads;

      #[Validate('image|extensions:png')]
      public $file;

      public function save()
      {
          $this->validate();

          $this->file->storeAs(
              path: 'images',
              name: $this->file->getClientOriginalName(),
              options: ['disk' => 'public'],
          );
      }
  }
  ```
