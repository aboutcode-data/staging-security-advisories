  - CVE-2021-32824
summary: "Apache Dubbo vulnerable to remote code execution via Telnet Handler\nApache Dubbo\
  \ is a Java based, open source RPC framework. Versions prior to 2.6.10 and 2.7.10 are vulnerable\
  \ to pre-authorization remote code execution via arbitrary bean manipulation in the Telnet\
  \ handler. The Dubbo main service port can be used to access a Telnet Handler which offers\
  \ some basic methods to collect information about the providers and methods exposed by the\
  \ service and it can even allow to shutdown the service. This endpoint is unprotected. \n\n\
  Additionally, a provider method can be invoked using the `invoke` handler. This handler uses\
  \ a safe version of FastJson to process the call arguments. However, the resulting list is\
  \ later processed with `PojoUtils.realize` which can be used to instantiate arbitrary classes\
  \ and invoke its setters. Even though FastJson is properly protected with a default blocklist,\
  \ `PojoUtils.realize` is not, and an attacker can leverage that to achieve remote code execution.\
  \ \n\nVersions 2.6.10 and 2.7.10 contain fixes for this issue."
