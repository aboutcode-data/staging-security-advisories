aliases:
  - CVE-2023-39349
summary: |
  Privilege escalation via ApiTokensEndpoint
  ### Impact
  An attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests.

  There is no evidence that the issue was exploited on https://sentry.io. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens via `https://your-self-hosted-sentry-installation/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/`.

  ### Patches
  The issue was fixed in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/53850 and is available in the release 23.7.2 of [sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/23.7.2) and [self-hosted](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.7.2).

  ### Workarounds
  There are no known workarounds.
