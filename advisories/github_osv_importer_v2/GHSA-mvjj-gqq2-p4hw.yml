aliases:
  - CVE-2018-6341
summary: "Cross-Site Scripting in react-dom\nAffected versions of `react-dom` are vulnerable\
  \ to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to validate attribute names in HTML tags\
  \ which may lead to Cross-Site Scripting in specific scenarios. This may allow attackers to\
  \ execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. To be affected by this vulnerability,\
  \ the application needs to:\n- be a server-side React app\n- be rendered to HTML using `ReactDOMServer`\n\
  - include an attribute name from user input in an HTML tag\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you\
  \ are using `react-dom` 16.0.x, upgrade to 16.0.1 or later.  \nIf you are using `react-dom`\
  \ 16.1.x, upgrade to 16.1.2 or later.  \nIf you are using `react-dom` 16.2.x, upgrade to 16.2.1\
  \ or later.  \nIf you are using `react-dom` 16.3.x, upgrade to 16.3.3 or later.  \nIf you\
  \ are using `react-dom` 16.4.x, upgrade to 16.4.2 or later."
