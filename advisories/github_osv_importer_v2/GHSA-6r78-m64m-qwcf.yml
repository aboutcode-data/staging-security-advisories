  Moq v4.20.0-rc to 4.20.1 share hashed user data
  Moq v4.20.0-rc to 4.20.1 include support for [SponsorLink](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink), which runs an obfuscated DLL at build time that scans local `git config` data and shares the user's hashed email address with SponsorLink's remote servers. There is no option to disable this.

  Moq v4.20.2 has removed this functionality.
