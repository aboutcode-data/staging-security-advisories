summary: "Publify Vulnerable To Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Via Redirects Requiring User Interaction\n\
  ### Summary\nA publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting\
  \ attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality.\n\n### Details\nA publisher\
  \ on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting attack on an administrator\
  \ using the redirect functionality. The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the\
  \ administrator to click a malicious link.\n\nWe can create a redirect to a `javascript:alert()`\
  \ URL. Whilst the redirect itself doesn't work, on the administrative panel, an a tag is created\
  \ with the payload as the URI. Upon clicking this link, the XSS is triggered. \n\nAn attack\
  \ could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or other encodings, as to not make it\
  \ obvious to an administrator that this is a malicious link.\n\n### PoC\nA publisher can create\
  \ a new redirect as shown below. The payload used is `javascript:alert()`.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/295206083-3cf432c6-1f58-49a2-b09c-777e9707e0ff.png)\n\
  \nAn administrator will now see this redirect in their overview of the page.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/295206204-3d4dc59a-8f82-42f3-98b2-a1809790351f.png)\n\
  \nIf they click the link on the right, it triggers the XSS.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/295206292-3fea85f5-6918-4eff-8206-4a275a6e79e4.png)\n\
  \n### Impact\nA publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges\
  \ and become an administrator."
