  Cross-Site Scripting in mrk.js
  Versions of `mrk.js` before 2.0.1 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) when markdown is converted to HTML.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 2.0.1 or later and use `mark.sanitizeURL()` for any `src` and `href` attributes when extending the markdown.
