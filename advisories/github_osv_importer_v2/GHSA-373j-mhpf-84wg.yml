summary: |
  Janssen Config API returns results without scope verification
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_
  The configAPI is an internal service and hence should never be exposed to the internet. With that said, this is a serious vulnerability that has a large internal surface attack area that exposes all sorts of information from the IDP including clients, users, scripts ..etc.

  This affects all users of Janssen <1.8.0 and Gluu Flex <5.8.0

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_
  All users are advised to upgrade immediately to [1.8.0](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/releases/tag/v1.8.0) for Janssen users and [5.8.0](https://github.com/GluuFederation/flex/releases/tag/v5.8.0) For Flex users.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_
  The user can potentially fork and build the config api and patch it in their system following the commit here https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/commit/92eea4d4637f1cae16ad2f07b2c16378ff3fc5f1
