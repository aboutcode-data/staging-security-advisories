summary: "Authenticated users can view job names and groups they do not have authorization to\
  \ view\nAccess to two URLs used in both Rundeck Open Source and Process Automation products\
  \ could allow authenticated users to access the URL path, which provides a list of job names\
  \ and groups for any project, without the necessary authorization checks.\n\nThe affected\
  \ URLs are:\n- `http[s]://[host]/context/rdJob/*` \n- `http[s]://[host]/context/api/*/incubator/jobs`\n\
  \nThe output of these endpoints only exposes the name of job groups and the jobs contained\
  \ within the specified project.  The output is read-only and the access does not allow changes\
  \ to the information.\n\n### Impact\n\nRundeck, Process Automation version 4.17.0 up to 4.17.2\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nPatched versions: 4.17.3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAccess to two URLs used in\
  \ either Rundeck Open Source or Process Automation products could be blocked at a load balancer\
  \ level.\n- `http[s]://host/context/rdJob/*` \n- `http[s]://host/context/api/*/incubator/jobs`\n\
