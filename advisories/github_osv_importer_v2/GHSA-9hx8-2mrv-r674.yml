  - CVE-2021-37578
summary: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Apache jUDDI\nApache jUDDI uses several classes\
  \ related to Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) which (as an extension to UDDI) provides\
  \ an alternate transport for accessing UDDI services.\n\nRMI uses the default Java serialization\
  \ mechanism to pass parameters in RMI invocations. A remote attacker can send a malicious\
  \ serialized object to the above RMI entries. The objects get deserialized without any check\
  \ on the incoming data. In the worst case, it may let the attacker run arbitrary code remotely.\
  \ \n\nFor both jUDDI web service applications and jUDDI clients, the usage of RMI is disabled\
  \ by default. Since this is an optional feature and an extension to the UDDI protocol, the\
  \ likelihood of impact is low. Starting with 3.3.10, all RMI related code was removed."
