summary: |
  Unsafe eval() in summit allows arbitrary code execution
  Affected versions of `summit` allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands via collection names when using the `PouchDB` driver.

  ## Recommendation

  No direct patch is available at this time.

  Currently, the best option to mitigate the issue is to avoid using the `PouchDB` driver, as the package author has abandoned this feature entirely.
