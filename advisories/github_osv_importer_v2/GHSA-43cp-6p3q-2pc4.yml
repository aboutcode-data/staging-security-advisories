summary: |
  HtmlSanitizer vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting in Foreign Content
  ### Impact

  The vulnerability occurs in configurations where foreign content is allowed, i.e. either `svg` or `math` are in the list of allowed elements.
  Specifically, the requirements for the vulnerability are:

  1. Allowing one foreign element: `svg`, or `math`
  2. Comments or one raw text element: `iframe`, `noembed`, `xmp`, `title`, `noframes`, `style` or `noscript`

  Configurations that meet the above requirements plus the following are vulnerable to an additional vulnerability:

  - Any HTML integration element: `title`, `desc`, `mi`, `mo`, `mn`, `ms`, `mtext`, `annotation-xml`.

  In case an application sanitizes user input with a vulnerable configuration, an attacker could
  bypass the sanitization and inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code.

  Note that in the default configuration the vulnerability is not present.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 8.0.723 and 8.1.722-beta (preview version).

  ### Workarounds

  Disallow foreign elements `svg` and `math`. This is the case in the default configuration, which is therefore not affected by the vulnerability.
