aliases:
  - CVE-2022-36077
summary: |
  Exfiltration of hashed SMB credentials on Windows via file:// redirect
  ### Impact
  When following a redirect, Electron delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.

  ### Patches
  This issue has been fixed in all current stable versions of Electron. Specifically, these versions contain the fixes:

  - 21.0.0-beta.1
  - 20.0.1
  - 19.0.11
  - 18.3.7

  We recommend all apps upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron.

  ### Workarounds
  If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents:

  ```js
  app.on('web-contents-created', (e, webContents) => {
    webContents.on('will-redirect', (e, url) => {
      if (/^file:/.test(url)) e.preventDefault()
    })
  })
  ```
