  Zalgo-like output that crashes the server
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  [`colors`](https://npmjs.com/package/colors) package caused zalgo-like output (see https://github.com/soketi/soketi/issues/276, https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/issues/289), breaking the servers.

  **Only NPM users that recently upgraded or installed the NPM package are affected.**

  Docker users seem to not be affected as the dependencies were bundled at the time of the build, which were tested.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Latest patch. `0.26.1` to be exact at the time of writing.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  You cannot get around this as it's related to dependencies.

  ### References
