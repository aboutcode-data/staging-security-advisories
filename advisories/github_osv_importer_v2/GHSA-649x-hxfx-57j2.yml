summary: "Vitess vulnerable to infinite memory consumption and vtgate crash\n### Summary\n\n\
  When executing the following simple query, the `vtgate` will go into an endless loop that\
  \ also keeps consuming memory and eventually will OOM.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen running the\
  \ following query, the `evalengine` will try evaluate it and runs forever.\n\n```\nselect\
  \ _utf16 0xFF\n```\n\nThe source of the bug lies in the collation logic that we have. The\
  \ bug applies to all `utf16`,  `utf32` and `ucs2` encodings.  In general, the bug is there\
  \ for any encoding where the minimal byte length for a single character is more than 1 byte.\n\
  \nThe decoding functions for these collations all implement logic like the following to enforce\
  \ the minimal character length:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/8f6cfaaa643a08dc111395a75a2d250ee746cfa8/go/mysql/collations/charset/unicode/utf16.go#L69-L71\n\
  \nThe problem is that all the callers of `DecodeRune` expect progress by returning the number\
  \ of bytes consumed. This means that if there's only 1 byte left in an input, it will here\
  \ return still `0` and the caller(s) don't consume the character. \n\nOne example of such\
  \ a caller is the following:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/8f6cfaaa643a08dc111395a75a2d250ee746cfa8/go/mysql/collations/charset/convert.go#L73-L79\n\
  \nThe logic here moves forward the pointer in the input `[]byte` but if `DecodeRune` returns\
  \ `0` in case of error, it will keep running forever. The OOM happens since it keeps adding\
  \ the `?` as the invalid character to the destination buffer infinitely, growing forever until\
  \ it runs out of memory.\n\nThe fix here would be to always return forward progress also on\
  \ invalid strings. \n\nThere's also a separate bug here that even if progress is guaranteed,\
  \ `select _utf16 0xFF` will return the wrong result currently. MySQL will pad here the input\
  \ when the `_utf16` introducer is used with leading `0x00` bytes and then decode to UTF-16,\
  \ resulting in the output of `ÿ` here. \n\n### PoC\n\n```\nselect _utf16 0xFF\n```\n\n###\
  \ Impact\n\nDenial of service attack by triggering unbounded memory usage."
