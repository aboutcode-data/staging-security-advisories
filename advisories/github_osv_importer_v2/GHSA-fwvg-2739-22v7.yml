summary: |
  Miniflare vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  ### Impact
  Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to Miniflare's server could result in arbitrary HTTP and WebSocket requests being sent from the server. If Miniflare was configured to listen on external network interfaces (as was the default in `wrangler` until `3.19.0`), an attacker on the local network could access other local servers.

  ### Patches
  The issue was fixed in `miniflare@3.20231030.2`.

  ### Workarounds
  Ensure Miniflare is configured to listen on just local interfaces. This is the default behaviour, but can also be configured with the `host: "127.0.0.1"` option.
