summary: "Snowflake JDBC Security Advisory\n### Impacted Products\nSnowflake JDBC driver versions\
  \ >= 3.2.6 & <= 3.19.1 are affected.\n\n### Introduction\nSnowflake recently identified an\
  \ issue affecting JDBC drivers that can result in data being uploaded to an encrypted stage\
  \ without the additional layer of protection provided by client side encryption. The issue,\
  \ which affects only a subset of accounts hosted on Azure and GCP deployments (AWS deployments\
  \ are not affected), manifests in instances where customers create a stage using a JDBC driver\
  \ with the CLIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_SIZE account parameter set to 256-bit rather than the default\
  \ 128-bit. The data is still protected by TLS in transit and server side encryption at rest.\
  \ This missed layer of the additional protection is not visible to the affected customers.\n\
  \n### Incorrect Security Setting Vulnerability \n#### Description\nSnowflake identified an\
  \ incorrect security setting in Snowflake JDBC drivers. Snowflake has evaluated the severity\
  \ of the issue and determined it was in medium range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 5.9.\
  \ \n#### Scenarios and attack vector(s)\nUsers of Snowflake JDBC drivers with accounts on\
  \ Azure and GCP deployments who set the parameter CLIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_SIZE = 256 were subject\
  \ to this incorrect security setting vulnerability as it could result in data being uploaded\
  \ to a stage without an additional layer for encryption. \n#### Our response\nOn July 23,\
  \ 2024, Snowflake discovered this vulnerability. On 10/28/2024, Snowflake released a patch\
  \ in Snowflake JDBC driver Version 3.20.0. The patch fixes the incorrect security setting.\
  \ \n#### Resolution\nWe strongly recommend users to upgrade to 3.20.0 or later versions as\
  \ soon as possible. \n\n### Contact\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our\
  \ products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please\
  \ see our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
