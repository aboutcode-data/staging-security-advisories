summary: |
  Integer overflow due to conversion to unsigned
  ### Impact
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value.

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf

  tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad(
    gradients=[1.0,2.0],
    input=[1.0,1.0],
    input_min=[0.0],
    input_max=[10.0],
    axis=-100)
  ```

  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126) uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer.

  ### Patches
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1).

  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
