  - CVE-2023-33966
summary: |
  Missing "--allow-net" permission check for built-in Node modules
  ### Impact

  Outbound HTTP requests made using the built-in "node:http" or "node:https" modules are incorrectly not checked against the network permission allow list (`--allow-net`). Dependencies relying on these built-in modules are subject to the vulnerability too.

  Users of Deno versions prior to 1.34.0 are unaffected. Deno Deploy users are unaffected.

  ### Patches

  This problem has been patched in Deno v1.34.1 and all users are recommended to update to this version.

  ### Workarounds

  No workaround is available for this issue.
