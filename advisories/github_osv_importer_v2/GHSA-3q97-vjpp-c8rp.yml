summary: |
  Socialstream has a Potential Account Takeover Vulnerability in Social Account Linking Due to Missing User Consent After OAuth Callback
  ## Description

  When linking a social account to an already authenticated user, the lack of a confirmation step introduces a security risk. This is exacerbated if ->stateless() is used in the Socialite configuration, bypassing state verification and making the exploit easier. Developers should ensure that users explicitly confirm account linking and avoid configurations that skip critical security checks.

  ## Resolution
  Socialstream v6.2 introduces a new custom route that requires a user to "Confirm" or "Deny" a request to link a social account.
