  - CVE-2025-46816
summary: |
  goshs route not protected, allows command execution
  ### Summary

  It seems that when running **goshs** without arguments it is possible for anyone to execute commands on the server. This was tested on version **1.0.4** of **goshs**. The command function was introduced in version **0.3.4**.

  ### Details

  It seems that the function ```dispatchReadPump``` does not checks the option cli ```-c```, thus allowing anyone to execute arbitrary command through the use of websockets.

  ### PoC

  Used **websocat** for the POC:
  ```bash
  echo -e '{"type": "command", "content": "id"}' |./websocat 'ws://192.168.1.11:8000/?ws' -t
  ```

  ### Impact

  The vulnerability will only impacts goshs server on vulnerable versions.
