summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File in Gradio Flagging
  ### Impact
  The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer.

  ### Patches
  The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the data saved to the csv with single quotes.

  ### Workarounds
  If you are using an older version of `gradio`, don't open csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.
