summary: "Fleet: Sensitive Google Calendar credentials disclosed to low-privileged users\n###\
  \ Summary\n\nA vulnerability in Fleet’s configuration API could expose Google Calendar service\
  \ account credentials to authenticated users with low-privilege roles. This may allow unauthorized\
  \ access to Google Calendar resources associated with the service account.\n\n### Impact\n\
  \nFleet returns configuration data through an API endpoint that is accessible to authenticated\
  \ users, including those with the lowest-privilege “Observer” role. In affected versions,\
  \ Google Calendar service account credentials were not properly obfuscated before being returned.\n\
  \nAs a result, a low-privilege user could retrieve the service account’s private key material.\
  \ Depending on how the Google Calendar integration is configured, this could allow unauthorized\
  \ access to calendar data or other Google Workspace resources associated with the service\
  \ account.\n\nThis issue does not allow escalation of privileges within Fleet or access to\
  \ device management functionality.\n\n### Patches\n\n- v4.80.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf an\
  \ immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators should remove the Google Calendar integration\
  \ from Fleet and rotate the affected Google service account credentials.\n\n### For more information\n\
  \nIf there are any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail Fleet at [security@fleetdm.com](mailto:security@fleetdm.com)\
  \  \nJoin #fleet in [osquery Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw)\n\
  \n### Credits\n\nFleet thanks @secfox-ai for responsibly reporting this issue."
