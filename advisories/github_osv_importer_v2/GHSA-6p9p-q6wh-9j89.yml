summary: "apko affected by unbounded resource consumption in expandapk.Split on attacker-controlled\
  \ .apk streams\n`expandapk.Split` drains the first gzip stream of an APK archive via `io.Copy(io.Discard,\
  \ gzi)` without explicit bounds. With an attacker-controlled input stream, this can force\
  \ large gzip inflation work and lead to resource exhaustion (availability impact).       \
  \                                                                                        \
  \                       \n                                                               \
  \                                                                                        \
  \                                       \nThe `Split` function reads the first tar header,\
  \ then drains the remainder of the gzip stream by reading from the gzip reader directly without\
  \ any maximum uncompressed byte limit or inflate-ratio cap. A caller that parses attacker-controlled\
  \ APK streams may be forced to spend excessive CPU time inflating gzip data, leading to timeouts\
  \ or process slowdown.             \n                                                    \
