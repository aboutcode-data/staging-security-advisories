  scheb/two-factor-bundle bypass two-factor authentication with remember-me option
  In versions prior to 3.26.0 and prior to 4.11.0 of the "scheb/two-factor-bundle" project, a security vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) using the remember_me cookie. When the remember_me checkbox was used during login, a "REMEMBERME" cookie was created. Upon redirection to the 2FA page, attackers could manipulate the SESSIONID key, granting access to the homepage "/" and gaining authentication without completing 2FA.
