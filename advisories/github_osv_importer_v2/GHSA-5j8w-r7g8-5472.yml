  Arrow2 allows double free in `safe` code
  The struct `Ffi_ArrowArray` implements `#derive(Clone)` that is inconsistent with
  its custom implementation of `Drop`, resulting in a double free when cloned.

  Cloning this struct in `safe` results in a segmentation fault, which is unsound.

  This derive was removed from this struct. All users are advised to either:
  * bump the patch version of this crate (for versions `v0.7,v0.8,v0.9`), or
  * migrate to a more recent version of  the crate (when using `<0.7`).

  Doing so elimitates this vulnerability (code no longer compiles).
