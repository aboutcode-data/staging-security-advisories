summary: "Craft Commerce has Stored XSS in Shipping Methods Name Field Leading to Potential\
  \ Privilege Escalation\n## Summary\n\nA stored XSS vulnerability in Craft Commerce allows\
  \ attackers to execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator’s browser. This occurs because\
  \ the Shipping Methods Name field in the **Store Management** section is not properly sanitized\
  \ before being displayed in the admin panel.\n\n---\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### Requirments\n\
  - General permissions:\n\t- Access the control panel\n\t- Access Craft Commerce\n- Craft Commerce\
  \ permissions:\n\t- Manage store settings\n\t- Manage shipping\n- An active administrator\
  \ elevated session\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Log in to the Admin Panel with the attacker\
  \ account with the permissions mentioned above.\n2. Navigate to **Commerce** -> **Store Management**\
  \ -> **Shipping Methods** (`/admin/commerce/store-management/primary/shippingmethods`).\n\
  3. Create a new shipping method.\n4. In the **Name** field, enter the following payload:\n\
  ```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"alert(document.domain)\">\n```\n4. Click **Save** & Go back\
  \ to the previous page.\n5. Notice the alert proving JavaScript execution.\n\n\n### Privilege\
  \ Escalation to Administrator:\n\n1. Do the same steps above, but replace the payload with\
  \ a malicious one.\n2. The following payload elevates the attacker’s account to Admin if there’s\
  \ already an elevated session, replace the `<UserID>` with your attacker id:\n3. \n```html\n\
  <img src=x onerror=\"fetch('/admin/users/<UserID>/permissions',{method:'POST',body:`CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN=${Craft.csrfTokenValue}&userId=<UserID>&admin=1&action=users/save-permissions`,headers:{'content-type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}})\"\
  >\n```\n\n4. In another browser, log in as an admin & go to the vulnerable page (shipping\
  \ methods page).\n5. Go back to your attacker account & notice you are now an admin.\n\nThe\
  \ privilege escalation requires an elevated session. In a real-world scenario, an attacker\
  \ can automate the process by forcing a logout if the victim’s session is stale; upon re-authentication,\
  \ the stored XSS payload executes within a fresh, elevated session to complete the attack.\n\
  Or even easier (and smarter), an attacker (using the XSS) can create a fake 'Session Expired'\
  \ login modal overlay. Since it’s on the trusted domain, administrators will likely enter\
  \ their credentials, sending them directly to the attacker.\n\n### Resources:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/commerce/commit/fa273330807807d05b564d37c88654cd772839ee"
