summary: "Claude Code permission deny bypass through symlink\nClaude Code failed to account\
  \ for symlinks when checking permission deny rules. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code\
  \ access to a file and Claude Code had access to a symlink pointing to that file, it was possible\
  \ for Claude Code to access the file. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update will have\
  \ received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to\
  \ the latest version.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/vinai for reporting this issue!"
