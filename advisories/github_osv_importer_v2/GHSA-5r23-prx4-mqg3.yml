aliases:
  - CVE-2026-26963
summary: |
  Cilium may not enforce host firewall policies when Native Routing, WireGuard and Node Encryption are enabled
  ### Impact

  [Host Policies](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#host-policies) will incorrectly permit traffic from Pods on other nodes when all of the following configurations are enabled:
  * [Native Routing](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/concepts/routing/#native-routing)
  * [WireGuard](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#host-policies)
  * [Node Encryption](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-wireguard/#node-to-node-encryption-beta) (beta)

  These options are disabled by default in Cilium.

  ### Patches

  This issue was fixed by #42892.

  This issue affects:

  * Cilium v1.18 between v1.18.0 and v1.18.5 inclusive

  This issue is fixed in:

  * Cilium v1.18.6

  ### Workarounds

  There is currently no officially verified or comprehensive workaround for this issue. The following procedure has been validated strictly within a local 'Kind' environment and has not undergone exhaustive testing across diverse production architectures. Proceed with caution.

  To mitigate the identified traffic bypass, ensure all ingress traffic from the `cilium_wg0` interface is explicitly routed to `cilium_host` for policy enforcement. This ensures that host-level security policies are applied to decrypted WireGuard traffic. Execute the following configuration on each CiliumNode:

  ```bash
  # IPv4 Traffic
  ip rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300
  ip route add default dev cilium_host table 300

  # IPv6 Traffic
  ip -6 rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300
  ip -6 route add default dev cilium_net table 300
  ```
