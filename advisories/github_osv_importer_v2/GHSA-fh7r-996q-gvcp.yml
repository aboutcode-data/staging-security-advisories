aliases:
  - CVE-2023-30838
summary: |
  Possible XSS injection through Validate::isCleanHTML method
  ### Impact
  ValidateCore::isCleanHTML() method of Prestashop misses hijickable events which can lead to XSS injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup @keyframes methods.

  This XSS which hijacks HTML attributes will be triggered without any interaction of the visitor/administrator which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS.

  Contrary to most XSS which target HTML attributes and which are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope.

  ### Patches
  The patch will be on PS 8.0.4 and PS 1.7.8.9
