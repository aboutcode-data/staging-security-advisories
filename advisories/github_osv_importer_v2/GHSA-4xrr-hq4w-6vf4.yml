summary: "Caddy: Improper sanitization of glob characters in file matcher may lead to bypassing\
  \ security protections\n### Summary\n\nThe path sanitization in [file matcher](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/68d50020eef0d4c3398b878f17c8092ca5b58ca0/modules/caddyhttp/fileserver/matcher.go#L361)\
  \ doesn't sanitize backslashes which can lead to bypassing path related security protections.\n\
  \n### Details\n\nThe [try_files](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/try_files)\
  \ directive is used to rewrite the request uri. It accepts a list of patterns and checks if\
  \ any files exist in the root that match the provided patterns. It's commonly used in Caddy\
  \ configs. For example, it's used in SPA applications to rewrite every route that doesn't\
  \ exist as a file to `index.html`. \n \n```caddy\nexample.com {\n\troot * /srv\n\tencode\n\
  \ttry_files {path} /index.html\n\tfile_server\n}\n```\n\n`try_files` patterns are actually\
  \ glob patterns and file matcher expands them. The `{path}` in the pattern is replaced with\n\
  the request path and then [is expanded by `fs.Glob`](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/68d50020eef0d4c3398b878f17c8092ca5b58ca0/modules/caddyhttp/fileserver/matcher.go#L398).\
  \ The request path is sanitized before being placed inside the pattern and the special chars\
  \ are escaped . [The following code](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/68d50020eef0d4c3398b878f17c8092ca5b58ca0/modules/caddyhttp/fileserver/matcher.go#L361)\
  \ is the sanitization part.   \n\n```go\nvar globSafeRepl = strings.NewReplacer(\n\t\"*\"\
  , \"\\\\*\",\n\t\"[\", \"\\\\[\",\n\t\"?\", \"\\\\?\",\n)\n\nexpandedFile, err := repl.ReplaceFunc(file,\
  \ func(variable string, val any) (any, error) {\n    if runtime.GOOS == \"windows\" {\n  \
  \      return val, nil\n    }\n    switch v := val.(type) {\n    case string:\n        return\
  \ globSafeRepl.Replace(v), nil\n    case fmt.Stringer:\n        return globSafeRepl.Replace(v.String()),\
  \ nil\n    }\n    return val, nil\n})\n```\n\nThe problem here is that it does not escape\
  \ backslashes. `/something-\\*/` can match a file named `something-\\-anything.txt`, but it\
  \ should not. The primitive that this vulnerability provides is not very useful, as it only\
  \ allows an attacker to guess filenames that contain a backslash and they should also know\
  \ the characters before that backslash.\n\nThe backslash is mainly used to escape special\
  \ characters in glob patterns, but when it appears before non special characters, it is ignored.\
  \ This means that `h\\ello*` matches `hello world` even though `e` is not a special character.\
  \ This behavior can be abused to bypass path protections that might be in place. For example,\
  \ if there is a reverse proxy that only allows `/documents/*` to the internal network and\
  \ its upstream is a Caddy server that uses `try_files`, the reverse proxy's protection can\
  \ be bypassed by requesting the path `/do%5ccuments/`.\n\nSome configurations that implement\
  \ blacklisting and serving together in Caddy are also vulnerable but there's a condition that\
  \ the `try_files` directive and the filtering `route`/`handle` must not be in a same block\
  \ because `try_files` directive [executes before `route` and `handle` directives](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives#directive-order).\
  \ \n\nFor example the following config isn't vulnerable.\n\n```caddy\n:80 {\n    root * /srv\n\
  \n    route /documents/* {\n        respond \"Access denied\" 403\n    }\n\n    try_files\
  \ {path} /index.html\n    file_server\n}\n```\n\nBut this one is vulnerable.\n\n```caddy\n\
  :80 {\n    root * /srv\n\n    route /documents/* {\n        respond \"Access denied\" 403\n\
  \    }\n\n    route /* {\n        try_files {path} /index.html\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\
  ```\n\nThis config is also vulnerable because `Header` directives executes before `try_files`.\
  \ \n\n```caddy\n:80 {\n    root * /srv \n    header /uploads/* {\n        X-Content-Type-Options\
  \ \"nosniff\"\n        Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'none';\"\n    }\n    try_files\
  \ {path} /index.html\n    file_server\n}\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nPaste this script somewhere and\
  \ run it. It should print \"some content\" which means that the nginx protection has failed.\n\
  \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmkdir secret\necho 'some content' > secret/secret.txt\n\ncat > Caddyfile\
  \ <<'EOF'\n:80 {\n    root * /srv\n\n    try_files {path} /index.html\n    file_server\n}\n\
  EOF\n\ncat > nginx.conf <<'EOF'\nevents {}\n\nhttp {\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n \
  \       \n        location /secret {\n            return 403;\n        }\n\n        location\
  \ / {\n            proxy_pass http://caddy;\n            proxy_set_header Host $host;\n  \
  \      }\n    }\n}\nEOF\n\ncat > docker-compose.yml <<'EOF'\nservices:\n  caddy:\n    # caddy@sha256:c3d7ee5d2b11f9dc54f947f68a734c84e9c9666c92c88a7f30b9cba5da182adb\n\

  \  - ./secret:/srv/secret:ro\n  nginx:\n    # nginx@sha256:341bf0f3ce6c5277d6002cf6e1fb0319fa4252add24ab6a0e262e0056d313208\n\
