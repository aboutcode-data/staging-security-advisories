summary: |
  Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack Multipart Parsing
  There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the multipart parsing component of Rack.  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-30122.

  Versions Affected:  >= 1.2
  Not affected:       < 1.2
  Fixed Versions:     2.0.9.1, 2.1.4.1, 2.2.3.1

  ## Impact
  Carefully crafted multipart POST requests can cause Rack's multipart parser to take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service vulnerability.

  Impacted code will use Rack's multipart parser to parse multipart posts.  This includes directly using the multipart parser like this:

  ```
  params = Rack::Multipart.parse_multipart(env)
  ```

  But it also includes reading POST data from a Rack request object like this:

  ```
  p request.POST # read POST data
  p request.params # reads both query params and POST data
  ```

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

  ## Workarounds
  There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
