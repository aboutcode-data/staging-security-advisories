aliases:
  - CVE-2021-22964
summary: |
  DOS and Open Redirect with user input
  ### Impact

  A redirect vulnerability in the `fastify-static` module allows remote attackers to redirect Mozilla Firefox users to arbitrary websites via a double slash `//` followed by a domain: `http://localhost:3000//a//youtube.com/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e`.

  A DOS vulnerability is possible if the URL contains invalid characters `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000//^/.."`

  The issue shows up on all the `fastify-static` applications that set `redirect: true` option. By default, it is `false`.

  ### Patches
  The issue has been patched in `fastify-static@4.4.1`

  ### Workarounds
  If updating is not an option, you can sanitize the input URLs using the [`rewriteUrl`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Server/#rewriteurl) server option.
