summary: |
  AutoUpdater module fails to validate certain nested components of the bundle
  ### Impact
  This vulnerability allows attackers who have control over a given apps update server / update storage to serve maliciously crafted update packages that pass the code signing validation check but contain malicious code in some components.

  Please note that this kind of attack would require **significant** privileges in your own auto updating infrastructure and the ease of that attack entirely depends on your infrastructure security.

  * `18.0.0-beta.6`
  * `17.2.0`
  * `16.2.0`
  * `15.5.0`
