summary: |
  DynamicPageList3 vulnerability exposes hidden/suppressed usernames
  ### Summary
  Several `#dpl` parameters can leak usernames that have been hidden using revision deletion, suppression, or the `hideuser` block flag.

  ### Details
  The parameters `adduser`, `addauthor`, and `addlasteditor` output the page creator or last editor using the `%USER%` placeholder. These display the actual username, even when that name has been hidden using revision deletion, suppression (oversight), or `hideuser`.

  The `%CONTRIBUTOR%` placeholder, used with `addcontribution`, behaves similarly and also reveals hidden usernames.

  In addition, the following parameters can expose suppressed usernames when combined with `%USER%` or similar output placeholders:
  - `lastrevisionbefore`
  - `allrevisionsbefore`
  - `firstrevisionsince`
  - `allrevisionssince`

  These parameters reference specific revisions and allow output of user-related metadata. If a username has been hidden from those revisions, it may still appear in the output.

  Further, the parameters `createdby`, `notcreatedby`, `modifiedby`, `notmodifiedby`, `lastmodifiedby`, and `notlastmodifiedby` accept usernames as input. When the correct (suppressed) username is used, the query may return matching pages or edits. This can reveal the presence and association of a hidden identity, even if not displayed directly. However, this is a more indirect exposure than the output parameters mentioned above.

  ### Proof of Concept

  1. Create a page while logged in as a user.
  2. Revision delete or suppress the username from the page history.
  3. Use a DPL query with one of the affected parameters.
  4. The output reveals the hidden username.

  #### Example

  The following query reveals the suppressed username `Example user`:

  ```wikitext
  {{#dpl:
  | title = File:Example.png
  | addauthor = true
  | format = ,%USER%,,
  }}
  ```

  Similar behavior occurs using parameters like `lastrevisionbefore` with `%USER%` in the `format` string.

  ### Impact
  This issue causes the exposure of usernames that were intentionally hidden by administrators. It directly undermines revision deletion, user suppression, and block-related privacy measures. In some cases, usernames can be revealed both directly through output and indirectly through query behavior.
