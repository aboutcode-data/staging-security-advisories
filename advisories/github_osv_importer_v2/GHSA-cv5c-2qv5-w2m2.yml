  Passbolt Api Remote code execution
  Passbolt provides a way for system administrators to generate a PGP key for the server during installation. The wizard requests a username, an e-mail address and an optional comment. No escaping or verification is done by Passbolt, effectively allowing a user to inject bash code.

  The impact is very high, but the probability is very low given that this vulnerability can only be exploited during Passbolt’s installation stage.
