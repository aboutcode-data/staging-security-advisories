summary: |
  Cross-Site Request Forgery in Jenkins
  A race condition during Jenkins 2.94 and earlier; 2.89.1 and earlier startup could result in the wrong order of execution of commands during initialization. There is a very short window of time after startup during which Jenkins may no longer show the 'Please wait while Jenkins is getting ready to work' message but Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection may not yet be effective.
