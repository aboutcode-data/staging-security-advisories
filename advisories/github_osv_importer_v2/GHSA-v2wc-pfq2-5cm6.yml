summary: |
  Possible XSS attack in Wagtail
  ### Impact
  A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on the page revision comparison view within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft a page revision history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.

  ### Patches
  Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch).

  ### Workarounds
  Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable the revision comparison view by adding the following URL route to the top of their project's `urls.py` configuration:

      from django.views.generic.base import RedirectView

      urlpatterns = [
          url(r'^admin/pages/(\d+)/revisions/compare/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/admin/')),
          # ...
      ]

  Many thanks to Vlad Gerasimenko for reporting this issue.
