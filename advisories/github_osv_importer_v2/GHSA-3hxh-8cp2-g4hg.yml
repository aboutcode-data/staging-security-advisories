summary: "Use after free and segfault in shape inference functions\n### Impact\nWhen running\
  \ shape functions, some functions (such as `MutableHashTableShape`) produce extra output information\
  \ in the form of a `ShapeAndType` struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by\
  \ an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts\
  \ to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault.\n\n`ShapeRefiner` is mitigating\
  \ this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape\
  \ under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but we were not doing the same\
  \ for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and\
  \ types.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1).\
  \                                                                                        \
  \                  \n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick\
  \ this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also\
  \ affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our\
  \ security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more\
  \ information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions."
