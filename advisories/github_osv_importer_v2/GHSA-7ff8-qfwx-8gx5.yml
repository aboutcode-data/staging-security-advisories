summary: |
  Improper masking of some secrets in Jenkins Credentials Binding Plugin
  Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds. As a side effect of the fix for [SECURITY-698](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-02-05/#credentials-binding), `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`. This will then be expanded to $ again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.

  Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`). This occurs for example in the \"Execute Maven top-level targets\" build step included in Jenkins.\n\nCredentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets both in their original form and with escaped `$` characters, so they will be masked even if printed before value expansion.
