aliases:
  - CVE-2023-4918
summary: "Keycloak vulnerable to Plaintext Storage of User Password\nA flaw was discovered in\
  \ Keycloak Core package.  When a user registers itself through registration flow, the \"password\"\
  \ and \"password-confirm\" field from the form will occur as regular attributes in the users\
  \ attributes. The password is also created, but the user attributes must not be there. This\
  \ way, any entities (all users and clients with proper rights/roles) are able to retrieve\
  \ the users passwords in clear-text. \n\n### Impact\nPasswords for self-registered users are\
  \ stored as cleartext attributes associated with the user. \n\n### Mitigation\nDisable self-registration\
  \ for users in all realms until patched."
