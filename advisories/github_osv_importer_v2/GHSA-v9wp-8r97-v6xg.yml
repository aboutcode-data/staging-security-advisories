summary: "Cross-Site Scripting in jquery.json-viewer\nVersions of `jquery.json-viewer` prior\
  \ to 1.3.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package insufficiently sanitizes\
  \ user input when creating links, and concatenates the user input in an `<a>` tag. This allows\
  \ attackers to create malicious links with JSON payloads such as: \n```\n{\n  \"foo\": \"\
  https://bar.com\\\" onmouseover=alert('xss') \\\"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis may lead to arbitrary\
  \ JavaScript execution in a victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version\
  \ 1.3.0 or later."
