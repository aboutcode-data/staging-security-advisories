summary: "Authorization Bypass in I hate money\n### Impact\nAn authenticated member of one project\
  \ can modify and delete members of another project, without knowledge of this other project's\
  \ private code. This can be further exploited to access all bills of another project without\
  \ knowledge of this other project's private code.\n\nWith the default configuration, anybody\
  \ is allowed to create a new project. An attacker can create a new project and then use it\
  \ to become authenticated and exploit this flaw. As such, the exposure is similar to an unauthenticated\
  \ attack, because it is trivial to become authenticated.\n\n### Patches\n```diff\n ihatemoney/models.py\

  \ limit the impact, it is possible to disable public project creation by setting `ALLOW_PUBLIC_PROJECT_CREATION\
  \ = False` in the configuration (see [documentation](https://ihatemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html)).\
  \ Existing users will still be able to exploit the flaw, but this will prevent an external\
  \ attacker from creating a new project.\n\n### For more information\n\n`Person.query.get()`\
  \ and `Person.query.get_by_name()` were mistakenly running a database join on the Project\
  \ table without constraining the result.\n\nAs a result, `Person.query.get(42, \"projectfoo\"\
  )` would return the Person with id=42, even if it is not associated to the project \"projectfoo\"\
  .  The only condition is that \"projectfoo\" must exist.\n\nThis flaw can be exploited in\
  \ several places:\n\n1) API: PUT requests to `/api/projects/<project>/members/<personID>`\
  \ will succeed even though `<personID>` is not a member of `<project>`.\n\n   This allows\
  \ an authenticated attacker to alter the state of a member (name, weight, activated) in any\
  \ project.  In addition, the altered member will no longer be associated with its original\
  \ project but will be associated to the attacker project instead, breaking many features of\
  \ IHateMoney.  For instance, bills referencing the altered member will no longer be visible\
  \ in the original project.\n\n   This causes an additional information disclosure and loss\
  \ of integrity on bills: the attacker will now be able to see, edit and delete bills belonging\
  \ to the altered member, because IHateMoney now believes that these bills are associated to\
  \ the attacker project through the altered member.\n\n   For instance, assume that `Person(id=42)`\
  \ is a member of project \"targetProject\", and that the attacker has access to another project\
  \ \"attackerProject\" with the private code \"attackerPassword\".  The attacker can modify\
  \ `Person(id=42)` with this command:\n\n     $ curl -X PUT -d \"name=Pwn3d&activated=1\" --basic\
  \ -u attackerProject:attackerPassword http://$SERVER/api/projects/attackerProject/members/42\n\
  \n   The attacker can now see, edit and delete bills paid by `Person(id=42)` by simply browsing\
  \ to http://$SERVER/attackerProject/\n\n2) Editing a member through the web interface at `/<project>/members/<personID>/edit`\
  \ will succeed even though `<personID>` is not a member of `<project>`.\n\n   This is very\
  \ similar to the PUT exploit.  Reusing the same example, the attacker needs to login to its\
  \ \"attackerProject\" project with the private code \"attackerPassword\".  It can then alter\
  \ the state of `Person(id=42)` by accessing the edit form at the following URL:\n\n     http://$SERVER/attackerProject/members/42/edit\n\
  \n   Again, as a result of the alteration, the altered member will become associated to the\
  \ project \"attackerProject\", resulting in the same information disclosure and loss of integrity\
  \ on bills.\n\n3) API: DELETE requests to `/api/projects/<project>/members/<personID>` will\
  \ similarly allow to delete the member `<personID>` even if it belongs to a different project\
  \ than `<project>`.\n\n     $ curl -X DELETE --basic -u attackerProject:attackerPassword http://$SERVER/api/projects/attackerProject/members/42\n\
  \n   The impact is less serious than with PUT, because DELETE only deactivates a member (it\
  \ does not really delete it).\n\nAll these exploits require authentication: an attacker needs\
  \ to know a valid project name and its associated \"private code\".  Once this requirement\
  \ is fullfilled, the attacker can exploit this flaw to alter the state of members in any other\
  \ project, without needing to know the target project name or its private code.\n\n`Person.query.get_by_name()`\
  \ suffers from the same issue as `Person.query.get()`.  It has an additional issue: if multiple\
  \ Person objects with the same name exist (this is possible if they are associated to different\
  \ projects), `get_by_name()` will crash with `MultipleResultsFound` because of the call to\
  \ `one()`.\n\nHowever, since `Person.query.get_by_name()` is currently not used anywhere in\
  \ IHateMoney, the bug affecting this function has no impact and is not exploitable."
