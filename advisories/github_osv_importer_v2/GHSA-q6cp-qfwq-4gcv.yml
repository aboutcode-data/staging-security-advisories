  h2 servers vulnerable to degradation of service with CONTINUATION Flood
  An attacker can send a flood of CONTINUATION frames, causing `h2` to process them indefinitely. This results in an increase in CPU usage.

  Tokio task budget helps prevent this from a complete denial-of-service, as the server can still respond to legitimate requests, albeit with increased latency.

  More details at https://seanmonstar.com/blog/hyper-http2-continuation-flood/.

  Patches available for 0.4.x and 0.3.x versions.
