  Dep Group Remote Memory Exhaustion (Denial of Service) in ckb
  ### Impact
  A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust ckb process memory of an affected node.

  ### Patches
  Upgrade to 0.43.1 or later.

  ### References
  After resolving the outpoints of one dep group, we put the corresponding content into a vec ( https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/v0.42.0/util/types/src/core/cell.rs#L600-L617 ), there is a vulnerability to a memory dos attack because there is no determination of whether the outpoints is duplicated.

  PoC:
  ```
  before send dos tx rss:
  105700

  after rss:
  2306932
  ```

  DoS cost: 25.6 KB * 150 + dep_tx out_points capacity ( 36 * 150 * 100 = 540000 ) = 4380000 CKB
  Send 50 dos_tx, memory exhausted: (25.6 KB * 150  * 100) * 50 = 19.2 GB
