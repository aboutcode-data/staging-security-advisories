  Cross-Site Scripting in node-red
  Versions of `node-red` prior to 0.18.6 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to sanitize the `name` field in new items, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 0.18.6 or later.
