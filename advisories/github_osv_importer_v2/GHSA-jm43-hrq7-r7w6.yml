summary: "XWiki allows privilege escalation through link refactoring\n### Impact\n\nPages can\
  \ gain script or programming rights when they contain a link and the target of the link is\
  \ renamed or moved. This might lead to execution of scripts contained in xobjects that should\
  \ have never been executed. \nThis vulnerability affects all version of XWiki since 8.2 and\
  \ 7.4.5.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch consists in only setting the `originalMetadataAuthor`\
  \ when performing such change, so that it's displayed in the history but it has no impact\
  \ on the right evaluation (i.e. the original author of the changes is still used for right\
  \ computation). \n\nThis patch has been applied on XWiki 16.4.7, 17.1.0RC1, 16.10.4.\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround for this vulnerability, except preventing to perform\
  \ any refactoring operation with users having more than edit rights. \nAdministrators are\
  \ strongly advised to upgrade. If not possible, the patch only impacts module `xwiki-platform-refactoring-default`\
  \ so it's possible to apply the commit and rebuild and deploy only that module.\n\n### CVSS\
  \ explanation\n\nAttack vector: Network - Always for XWiki.\nComplexity: Low - The set of\
  \ operations to perform the attack is quite easy.\nAttack requirements: None - Any system\
  \ is vulnerable, it doesn't depend on specific condition other than user interaction.\nPrivileges\
  \ required: Low - The attacker only needs edit rights.\nUser interaction: Active - To be successful\
  \ the attack needs someone with more rights to perform a move/rename of a specific page.\n\
  Confidentiality: High - The attack might lead to execution of any script.\nIntegrity: High\
  \ - The attack might lead to execution of any script.\nAvailability: High - The attack might\
  \ lead to execution of any script.\nSubsequent system impacts: None for any criteria. Only\
  \ current system is affected.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or\
  \ comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n\
