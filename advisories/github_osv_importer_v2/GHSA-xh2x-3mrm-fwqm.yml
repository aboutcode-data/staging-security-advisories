  - CVE-2024-47870
summary: "Gradio has a race condition in update_root_in_config may redirect user traffic\n###\
  \ Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability involves\
  \ a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing an attacker to modify\
  \ the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting\
  \ this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead\
  \ to the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files.\
  \ This impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet,\
  \ where malicious actors could exploit this race condition.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please\
  \ upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue."
