  - CVE-2016-10589
summary: "selenium-binaries downloads resources over HTTP\nVersions of `selenium-binaries` prior\
  \ to 0.15.0 insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn\
  \ scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept\
  \ the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution\
  \ on the system running `selenium-binaries`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nA fix for this vulnerability\
  \ is available on the `master` branch of the repository as part of version 0.15.0.\n\nAnother\
  \ mitigation currently available is to use an alternate package, such as [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver),\
  \ the official selenium bindings for node.js."
