aliases:
  - CVE-2020-2268
summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability in MongoDB Plugin
  Jenkins MongoDB Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to gain access to some metadata of any arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
