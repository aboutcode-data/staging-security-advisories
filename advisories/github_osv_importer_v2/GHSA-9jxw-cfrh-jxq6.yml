  - CVE-2021-39172
summary: |
  Cachet vulnerable to new line injection during configuration edition
  ### Impact

  Authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (_User_ or _Admin_), can exploit a new line injection in the configuration edition feature (e.g. mail settings) and gain arbitrary code execution on the server.

  ### Patches

  This issue was addressed by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of new lines characters in new configuration values.

  ### Workarounds

  Only allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.
