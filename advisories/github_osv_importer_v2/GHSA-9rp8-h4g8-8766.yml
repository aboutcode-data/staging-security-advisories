  - CVE-2026-22251
summary: |
  Weblate wlc has insecure API key configuration
  ### Impact
  Historically, wlc supported providing unscoped API keys in the setting. This practice was discouraged for years, but the code was never removed. This might cause the API key to be used against different server.

  ### Patches
  * https://github.com/WeblateOrg/wlc/pull/1098

  ### Workarounds
  Remove unscoped `key` from wlc configuration. Only use URL-scoped keys in the `[keys]` sections.
