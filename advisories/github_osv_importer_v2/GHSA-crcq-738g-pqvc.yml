summary: |
  Craft CMS Potential Remote Code Execution via Twig SSTI
  Note that users must have administrator access to the Craft Control Panel, and [allowAdminChanges](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#allowadminchanges) must be enabled for this to work, which is against Craft CMS' recommendations for any non-dev environment.

  Note: This is a follow-up to [GHSA-f3cw-hg6r-chfv](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-f3cw-hg6r-chfv)

  Users should update to the patched versions (4.16.6 and 5.8.7) to mitigate the issue.
