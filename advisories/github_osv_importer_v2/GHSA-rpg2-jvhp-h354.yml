  - CVE-2025-3931
summary: "Yggdrasil Vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation\nA flaw was found in Yggdrasil,\
  \ which acts as a system broker, allowing the processes to communicate to other children's\
  \ \"worker\" processes through the DBus component. Yggdrasil creates a DBus method to dispatch\
  \ messages to workers. However, it misses authentication and authorization checks, allowing\
  \ every system user to call it. One available Yggdrasil worker acts as a package manager with\
  \ capabilities to create and enable new repositories and install or remove packages. \n\n\
  This flaw allows an attacker with access to the system to leverage the lack of authentication\
  \ on the dispatch message to force the Yggdrasil worker to install arbitrary RPM packages.\
  \ This issue results in local privilege escalation, enabling the attacker to access and modify\
  \ sensitive system data."
