  - CVE-2016-10661
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in phantomjs-cheniu\nAffected versions of `phantomjs-cheniu`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `phantomjs-cheniu`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for\
  \ this vulnerability.\n\nAs this package is just a fork of Medium's [`phantomjs-prebuilt`](https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs)\
  \ package, the best mitigation is currently to install the `Medium` version of [`phantomjs-prebuilt`](https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs).\
  \ This can be done via the following command:\n```\nnpm i phantomjs-prebuilt\n```"
