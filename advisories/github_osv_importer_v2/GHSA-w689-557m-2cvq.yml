  Server-Side Request Forgery in gogs webhook
  ### Impact

  The malicious user is able to discover services in the internal network through webhook functionality. All installations accepting public traffic are affected.

  ### Patches

  Webhook payload URLs are revalidated before each delivery to make sure they are not resolved to blocked local network addresses. Users should upgrade to 0.12.8 or the latest 0.13.0+dev.

  ### Workarounds

  Run Gogs in its own private network.
