  ## Advisory FAQ

  ### How do I know if I am affected?

  If all of the following are true:

  1. Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#user-content-affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.
  1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.

  ### How do I update to an unaffected version?
