  - CVE-2025-62725
summary: "Docker Compose Vulnerable to Path Traversal via OCI Artifact Layer Annotations\nDocker\
  \ Compose trusts the path information embedded in remote OCI compose artifacts. When a layer\
  \ includes the annotations com.docker.compose.extends or com.docker.compose.envfile, Compose\
  \ joins the attacker‑supplied value from com.docker.compose.file/com.docker.compose.envfile\
  \ with its local cache directory and writes the file there. \n\n### Impact\nThis affects any\
  \ platform or workflow that resolves remote OCI compose artifacts, Docker Desktop, standalone\
  \ Compose binaries on Linux, CI/CD runners, cloud dev environments is affected.\nAn attacker\
  \ can escape the cache directory and overwrite arbitrary files on the machine running docker\
  \ compose, even if the user only runs read‑only commands such as docker compose config or\
  \ docker compose ps.\n\n### Patches\nv2.40.2\n\n### Workarounds\nNA"
