summary: "Pimcore is Vulnerable to Broken Access Control: Missing Function Level Authorization\
  \ on \"Static Routes\" Listing\n### Summary\nThe application fails to enforce proper server-side\
  \ authorization checks on the API endpoint responsible for reading or listing static routes.\
  \ In Pimcore, static routes are custom URL patterns defined via the backend interface or the\
  \ var/config/staticroutes.php file, including details like regex-based patterns, controllers,\
  \ variables, and priorities. These routes are registered automatically through the PimcoreStaticRoutesBundle\
  \ and integrated into the MVC routing system. Testing revealed that an authenticated backend\
  \ user lacking explicit permissions was able to invoke the endpoint (e.g., GET /api/static-routes)\
  \ and retrieve sensitive route configurations. This violates OWASP A01:2021 Broken Access\
  \ Control, as function-level authorization is absent, allowing unauthorized access to internal\
  \ routing metadata. Without validation, the endpoint exposes route structures, potentially\
  \ revealing application architecture, endpoints, or custom logic intended for administrative\
  \ roles only.\n\n### Details\nThe backend user without permission was still able to list \"\
  Static Routes\" item\n\n### Step to Reproduce the issue\nlogin as Admin (full permission)\
  \ and clicked \"Static Routes\"\n<img width=\"945\" height=\"858\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10\

  \ />\n\nAfter that, pasted the copied \"Cookie\" and \"X-Pimcore-Csrf-Token\" to captured\
  \ request\n\n-List API\n \n<img width=\"1132\" height=\"829\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-10\

  \ />\n\n\n\n### Impact\nExploitation enables low-privileged users to enumerate static routes,\
  \ gaining reconnaissance into URL patterns, associated controllers, and parameter handling,\
  \ which could facilitate targeted attacks like path traversal, injection via exposed variables,\
  \ or discovery of hidden administrative paths. In a Pimcore environment, this might expose\
  \ site-specific routing for multi-tenant setups, leading to unauthorized data access, workflow\
  \ manipulation, or escalation to broader system compromise. Business impacts include intellectual\
  \ property leakage of custom routing logic, regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR for exposed\
  \ configs), and increased attack surface for chaining with other vulnerabilities."
