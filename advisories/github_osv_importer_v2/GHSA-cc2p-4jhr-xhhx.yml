summary: |
  False-positive validity for NFT1 genesis transactions in SLPJS
  ### Impact
  In the npm package named "slpjs", versions prior to 0.27.4 are vulnerable to false-positive validation outcomes for the NFT1 Child Genesis transaction type. A poorly implemented SLP wallet or opportunistic attacker could create a seemingly valid NFT1 child token without burning any of the NFT1 Group token type as is required by the NFT1 specification.

  ### Patches
  npm package "slpjs" has been patched and is published and tagged as version 0.27.4.

  ### Workarounds
  Upgrade to slpjs 0.27.4.
