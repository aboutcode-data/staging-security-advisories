  - CVE-2025-62596
summary: |
  youki container escape and denial of service due to arbitrary write gadgets and procfs write redirects
  ### Impact ###

  youki’s apparmor handling performs insufficiently strict write-target validation, which—combined with path substitution during pathname resolution—can allow writes to unintended procfs locations.

  **Weak write-target check**
  youki only verifies that the destination lies somewhere under procfs. As a result, a write intended for `/proc/self/attr/apparmor/exec` can succeed even if the path has been redirected to `/proc/sys/kernel/hostname`(which is also in procfs).

  **Path substitution**
  While resolving a path component-by-component, a shared-mount race can substitute intermediate components and redirect the final target.

  This is a different project, but the core logic is similar to the CVE in runc. Issues were identified in runc, and verification was also conducted in youki to confirm the problems.
