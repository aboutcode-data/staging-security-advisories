summary: "mz-avro's incorrect use of `set_len` allows for un-initialized memory\nAffected versions\
  \ of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` \nimplementation.\n\
  \nArbitrary `Read` implementations can read from the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure)\n\
  and also can return incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer.\nReading from uninitialized\
  \ memory produces undefined values that can quickly invoke\nundefined behavior.\n\nNote: there\
  \ is only UB in the case where a user provides a struct whose `Read`\nimplementation inspects\
  \ the buffer passed to `read_exact` before writing to it.\nThis is an unidiomatic (albeit\
  \ possible) `Read` implementation.\n\nSee https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/8669\
  \ for details."
