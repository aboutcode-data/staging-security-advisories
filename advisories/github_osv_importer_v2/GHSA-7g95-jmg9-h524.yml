summary: |
  Jenkins cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
  Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not require POST requests for the HTTP endpoint toggling collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets (e.g., Build Queue and Build Executor Status widgets), resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  This vulnerability allows attackers to have users toggle their collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets.

  Additionally, as the API accepts any string as the identifier of the panel ID to be toggled, attacker-controlled content can be stored in the victim’s user profile in Jenkins.

  Jenkins 2.500, LTS 2.492.2 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.
