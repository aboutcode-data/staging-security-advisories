  1. [low] A user with permission to read any one of tags, branches, or commits on a repository may read all of them.
  1. [low] A user allowed to list objects in a repository _or_ read repository meta-data may retrieve graveler information about the location on underlying storage of all objects stored in any commit that they can view.
