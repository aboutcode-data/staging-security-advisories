summary: "Denial of service in go-ethereum due to CVE-2020-28362\n### Impact\nVersions of Geth\
  \ built with Go `<1.15.5` or `<1.14.12` are most likely affected by a critical DoS-related\
  \ security vulnerability. The golang team has registered the underlying flaw as ‘CVE-2020-28362’.\n\
  \nWe recommend all users to rebuild (ideally `v1.9.24`) with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12`, to\
  \ avoid node crashes. Alternatively, if you are running binaries distributed via one of our\
  \ official channels, we’re going to release `v1.9.24` ourselves built with Go `1.15.5`.\n\n\
  ### Patches\nThis is not an issue in go-ethereum, rebuilding an older version with Go `1.15.5`\
  \ or `1.14.12` will suffice to address the vulnerability. \n\n### Workarounds\nRebuilding\
  \ with Go `1.15.5` or `1.14.12` will suffice to address the vulnerability. \n\n### References\n\
