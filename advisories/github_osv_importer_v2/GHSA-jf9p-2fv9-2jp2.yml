  - CVE-2025-65947
summary: |
  thread-amount Vulnerable to Resource Exhaustion (Memory and Handle Leaks) on Windows and macOS
  Affected versions of this crate contain resource leaks when querying thread counts on Windows and Apple platforms.

  ### Windows
  The `thread_amount` function calls `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` but fails to close the returned `HANDLE` using `CloseHandle`. Repeated calls to this function will cause the handle count of the process to grow indefinitely, eventually leading to system instability or process termination when the handle limit is reached.

  ### macOS / iOS
  The `thread_amount` function calls `task_threads` (via Mach kernel APIs) which allocates memory for the thread list. The function fails to deallocate this memory using `vm_deallocate`. Repeated calls will result in a steady memory leak, eventually causing the process to be killed by the OOM (Out of Memory) killer.

  ### Impact
  Long-running applications (such as servers, daemons, or monitoring tools) that use this crate to periodically check thread counts will eventually crash due to resource exhaustion.
