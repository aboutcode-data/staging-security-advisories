  - CVE-2023-34242
summary: |
  Cilium vulnerable to information leakage via incorrect ReferenceGrant handling
  ### Impact

  When the [Gateway API](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.13/network/servicemesh/gateway-api/gateway-api/) is enabled in Cilium, the absence of a check on the namespace in which a [ReferenceGrant](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/) is created could result in Cilium gaining visibility of secrets (including certificates) and services across namespaces.

  An attacker on an affected cluster can configure Cilium to use cluster secrets or communicate with services that it should not have access to.

  Gateway API functionality is disabled by default.

  ### Patches

  This vulnerability is fixed in Cilium release 1.13.4.

  Cilium versions <1.13 are not affected.

  ### Workarounds

  There is no workaround to this issue.

  ### Acknowledgements
  The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @meyskens for investigating and fixing the issue.
