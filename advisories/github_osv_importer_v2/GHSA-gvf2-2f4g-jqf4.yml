  - CVE-2024-55638
summary: "Drupal core contains a potential PHP Object Injection vulnerability that (if combined\
  \ with another exploit) could lead to Remote Code Execution. It is not directly exploitable.\n\
  \nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that in order for it to be exploitable, a separate vulnerability\
  \ must be present to allow an attacker to pass unsafe input to `unserialize()`. There are\
  \ no such known exploits in Drupal core.\n\nTo help protect against this potential vulnerability,\
  \ some additional checks have been added to Drupal core's database code. If you use a third-party\
  \ database driver, check the release notes for additional configuration steps that may be\
  \ required in certain cases. \n\nThis issue affects Drupal Core: from 7.0 before 7.102, from\
  \ 8.0.0 before 10.2.11, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.9."
