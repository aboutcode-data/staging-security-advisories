  Symlink reference outside of node_modules in bin-links
  Versions of `bin-links` prior to 1.1.5 are vulnerable to a Symlink reference outside of node_modules. It is possible to create symlinks to files outside of the`node_modules` folder through the `bin` field. This may allow attackers to access unauthorized files.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.1.5 or later.
