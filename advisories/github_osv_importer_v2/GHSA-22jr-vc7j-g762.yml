summary: |
  Potential buffer overflow in psd-tools
  ### Impact
  An issue was discovered in psd-tools before 1.9.4. The Cython implementation of RLE decoding did not check for malformed PSD input data during decoding to the PIL.Image or NumPy format, leading to a Buffer Overflow.

  ### Patches
  Users of psd-tools version v1.8.37 to v1.9.3 should upgrade to v1.9.4.

  ### Workarounds
  Without Cython present on installation, buffer overflow does not occur but IndexError will be thrown. However, already installed psd-tools with Cython extention should be upgraded.
