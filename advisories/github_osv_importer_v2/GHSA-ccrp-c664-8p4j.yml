  Cross-Site Scripting in markdown-to-jsx
  Versions of `markdown-to-jsx` prior to 6.11.4 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Due to insufficient input sanitization the package may render output containing malicious JavaScript. This vulnerability can be exploited through input of links containing `data` or VBScript URIs and a base64-encoded payload.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 6.11.4 or later.
