summary: "NoSQL injection in express-cart\nVersions of `express-cart` before 1.1.8 are vulnerable\
  \ to NoSQL injection. \n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the lack of user input sanitization\
  \ in the login handlers. In both cases, the customer login and the admin login, parameters\
  \ from the JSON body are sent directly into the MongoDB query which allows to insert operators.\
  \ \n\nThese operators can be used to extract the value of the field blindly in the same manner\
  \ of a blind SQL injection. In this case, the `$regex` operator is used to guess each character\
  \ of the token from the start.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.1.8 or later."
