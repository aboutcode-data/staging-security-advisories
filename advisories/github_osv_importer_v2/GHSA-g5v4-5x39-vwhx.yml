summary: "Zip slip directory exploit in github.com/deislabs/oras\n### Impact\nThe directory\
  \ support (#55) allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the\
  \ user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links.\n\nA\
  \ well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or\
  \ overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory\
  \ unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. \n\nPrecisely,\
  \ the following users of the affected versions are impacted\n- `oras` CLI users who runs `oras\
  \ pull`.\n- Go programs, which invokes `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`.\n\
  \n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched by the PR linked with this advisory. Users should\
  \ upgrade their `oras` CLI and packages to `0.9.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor `oras` CLI users,\
  \ there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider.\n\nFor `oras`\
  \ package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`,\
  \ and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n### References\n\
