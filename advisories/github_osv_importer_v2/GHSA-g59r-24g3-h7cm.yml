aliases:
  - CVE-2025-64112
summary: |
  Statamic Vulnerable to Superadmin Account Takeover via Stored Cross-Site Scripting and Lack of Proper X-CSRF-TOKEN Server-Side Validation
  ### Impact

  Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Collections and Taxonomies allow authenticated users with content creation permissions to inject malicious JavaScript that executes when viewed by higher-privileged users.

  This affects:

  - Control panel users with permission to create or edit Collections and Taxonomies
  - Versions up to and including 5.22.0

  The vulnerability can be exploited to:

  - Change a super admin's password (versions ≤ 5.21.0)
  - Change a super admin's email address to initiate password reset (version 5.22.0)
  - Gain unauthorized access to superadmin accounts

  The attack requires:

  - An authenticated user with control panel and content creation permissions
  - A super admin to view the compromised content

  ### Patches

  This has been fixed in 5.22.1.
