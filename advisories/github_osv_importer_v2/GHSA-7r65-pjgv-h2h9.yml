summary: |
  Jenkins OpsGenie Plugin vulnerable to Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
  Jenkins OpsGenie Plugin 1.9 and earlier stores API keys unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.opsgenie.integration.jenkins.OpsGenieNotifier.xml` and in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

  Additionally, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the respective configuration forms.

  These API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission (job `config.xml` only) or access to the Jenkins controller file system (both).

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
