summary: |
  Tendermint light client verification not taking into account chain ID
  ### Impact

  Anyone using the `tendermint-light-client` and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes).

  At present, the light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client.

  The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks.

  ### Patches

  Users of the light client-related crates can currently upgrade to `v0.28.0`.

  ### Workarounds

  None
