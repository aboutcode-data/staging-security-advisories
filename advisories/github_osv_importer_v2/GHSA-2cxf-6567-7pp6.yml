summary: "Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n### Impact\nLocal information disclosure\
  \ of sensitive information downloaded via the API using the API Client. \n\n### Finding\n\
  The Datadog API is executed on a unix-like system with multiple users. The API is used to\
  \ download a file containing sensitive information. This sensitive information is exposed\
  \ locally to other users. This vulnerability exists in the API Client for version 1 and 2.\
  \ The method `prepareDownloadFilecreates` creates a temporary file with the permissions bits\
  \ of `-rw-r--r--` on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory\
  \ is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded via the `downloadFileFromResponse`\
  \ method will be visible to all other users on the local system.\n\nAnalysis of the finding\
  \ determined that the affected code was unused, meaning that the exploitation likelihood is\
  \ low. The unused code has been removed, effectively mitigating this issue. \n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ was found due to [this query](https://lgtm.com/query/8938575359870595124/) that [Jonathan\
  \ Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) contributed to the Semmle QL project.\n\n###\
  \ Patches\nThis issue has been patched in [version 1.0.0-beta.9](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-java/releases/tag/datadog-api-client-1.0.0-beta.9).\
  \ \n\nSee also [Remove unused downloadFile helpers](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-java/pull/637).\
  \ \n\n### Workarounds\nThe recommended workaround is to specify `java.io.tmpdir` when starting\
  \ the JVM with the flag `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, specifying a path to a directory with `drw-------`\
  \ permissions owned by `dd-agent`.\n\n### References\n* [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File\
  \ With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n* [CWE-379:\
  \ Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n\
