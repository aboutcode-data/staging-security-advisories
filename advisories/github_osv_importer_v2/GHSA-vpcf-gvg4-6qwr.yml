summary: "n8n: Expression Sandbox Escape Leads to RCE\n## Impact\nAdditional exploits in the\
  \ expression evaluation of n8n have been identified and patched following [CVE-2025-68613](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-v98v-ff95-f3cp).\
  \ \nAn authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse crafted\
  \ expressions in workflow parameters to trigger unintended system command execution on the\
  \ host running n8n.\n\n## Patches\nThe issues have been fixed in n8n versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3,\
  \ and 1.123.22. Users should upgrade to one of these versions or later to remediate all known\
  \ vulnerabilities.\n\n## Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators\
  \ should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n- Limit workflow creation and editing\
  \ permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted\
  \ operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.\n\
  \nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term\
  \ mitigation measures.\n\n### Resources\n- Best practices for [securing n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/overview/)\n\
