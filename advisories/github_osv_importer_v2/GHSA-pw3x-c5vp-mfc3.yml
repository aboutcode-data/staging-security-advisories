  - CVE-2024-47878
summary: |
  OpenRefine has a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) in GData extension (authorized.vt)
  ### Summary

  The `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so without escaping.

  An attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine.

  ### Details

  The `state` GET parameter is read from:

  * extensions/gdata/module/MOD-INF/controller.js:105

  It is used (as `$state`) in:

  * extensions/gdata/module/authorized.vt:43

  There is no check that the state has the expected format (base64-encoded JSON with values like "openrefine123..." and "cb123..."), or that the page was indeed opened as part of the authorization flow.

  ### PoC

  Navigate to:

      http://localhost:3333/extension/gdata/authorized?state=%22,alert(1),%22&error=

  An alert box pops up.

  The gdata extension needs to be present. No other configuration is needed; specifically, it is not required to have a client ID or client secret set.

  ### Impact

  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those extensions are also present.
