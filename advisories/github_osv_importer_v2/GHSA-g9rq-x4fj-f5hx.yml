  - CVE-2020-5256
summary: "Remote Code Execution Through Image Uploads in BookStack\n### Impact\n\nA user could\
  \ upload PHP files through image upload functions, which would allow them to execute code\
  \ on the host system remotely. They would then have the permissions of the PHP process.\n\n\
  This most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission to upload images\
  \ in any area of the application. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was addressed in a series of\
  \ patches: v0.25.3, v0.25.4 and v0.25.5.\nUsers should upgrade to at least v0.25.5 to avoid\
  \ this patch but ideally the latest BookStack version as previous versions are un-supported.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nDepending on BookStack version, you could use the [local_secure](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/upload-config/#local-secure)\
  \ image storage option, or use s3 or a similar compatible service.\n\nPreventing direct execution\
  \ of any `php` files, apart from the `public/index.php` file, though web-server configuration\
  \ would also prevent this.\n\n### References\n\n[BookStack Beta v0.25.3](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.3)\n\
  [BookStack Beta v0.25.4](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.4)\n\
  [BookStack Beta v0.25.5](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.5)\n\
