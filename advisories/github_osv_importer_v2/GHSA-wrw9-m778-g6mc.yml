  Memory Exposure in bl
  Versions of `bl` before 0.9.5 and 1.0.1 are vulnerable to memory exposure.

  `bl.append(number)` in the affected `bl` versions passes a number to Buffer constructor, appending a chunk of uninitialized memory


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 0.9.5, 1.0.1 or later.
