summary: |
  teler-waf contains detection rule bypass via Entities payload
  ### Description

  teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS functionality to protect against web-based attacks. teler-waf prior to version v0.2.0 is vulnerable to a bypass attack when a specific case-sensitive hex entities payload with special characters such as CR/LF and horizontal tab is used. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application.

  ### Impact

  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens, or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions.

  ### Patches

  Version [v0.2.0](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf/releases/tag/v0.2.0) includes a patch for this vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds

  We advised updating their installations to version v0.2.0 and frontwards immediately.
