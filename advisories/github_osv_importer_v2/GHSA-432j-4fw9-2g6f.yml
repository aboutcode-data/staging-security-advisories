  - CVE-2016-10668
summary: "libsbml downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `libsbml` insecurely download\
  \ an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has\
  \ a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the\
  \ executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `libsbml`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability, and the package\
  \ has not seen an update since 2013.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this\
  \ package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation\
  \ can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public\
  \ network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit\
  \ this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged\
  \ access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
