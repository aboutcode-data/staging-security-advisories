summary: |
  Clipboard-based XSS
  ### Impact
  XSS against the user.

  ### Details
  jsuites is vulnerable to DOM based XSS if the user can be tricked into copying _anything_ from a malicious and pasting it into the html editor. This is because a part of the clipboard content is directly written to `innerHTML` causing XSS.
