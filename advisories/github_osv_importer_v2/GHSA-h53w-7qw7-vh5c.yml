summary: "Snowflake NodeJS Driver vulnerable to Command Injection\n### Issue\nSnowflake was\
  \ informed via our bug bounty program of a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake\
  \ NodeJS driver via SSO browser URL authentication.\n\n### Impacted driver package: \nsnowflake-connector-nodejs\n\
  \n### Impacted version range: \nbefore [Version 1.6.21](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Node-js-Driver-Release-Notes)\
  \ \n\n### Attack Scenario\nIn order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker\
  \ would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting\
  \ users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible\
  \ server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked\
  \ a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would\
  \ render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. \n\nThis attack scenario\
  \ can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.  \n\
  \n### Solution\nOn April 18, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection\
  \ vulnerability in the Snowflake NodeJS driver via SSO browser URL authentication. The vulnerability\
  \ affected the Snowflake NodeJS driver before Version 1.6.21. We strongly recommend users\
  \ upgrade to Version 1.6.21 as soon as possible via the following resources: [Snowflake NodeJS\
  \ Driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/node-js/nodejs-driver)\n\n### Additional\
  \ Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites,\
  \ please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our [Vulnerability\
  \ Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
