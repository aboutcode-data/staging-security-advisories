summary: |
  1Panel IP Access Control Bypass via Untrusted X-Forwarded-For Headers
  ### Summary
  The server trusts all reverse-proxy headers by default, so any remote client can spoof `X-Forwarded-For` to bypass IP-based protections (AllowIPs, API IP whitelist, “localhost-only” checks). All IP-based access control becomes ineffective.

  ### Details
  - Gin is created with defaults (`gin.Default()`), which sets `TrustedProxies = 0.0.0.0/0` and uses `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` to compute `ClientIP()`.

  - IP-based controls rely on `ClientIP()`:
      - AllowIPs / BindDomain (core/middleware/ip_limit.go, core/utils/security/security.go).
      - API IP whitelist (core/middleware/api_auth.go).
      - "localhost-only" checks that depend on `ClientIP()`.

  - Because no trusted-proxy range is enforced, any client can send `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` (or a whitelisted IP) and be treated as coming from that address.

  ### Impact
  All IP-based access control is rendered ineffective: remote clients can masquerade as localhost or any whitelisted IP, defeating AllowIPs, API IP whitelists, and “localhost-only” protections.
