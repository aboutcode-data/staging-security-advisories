  tanton_engine has unsound public API
  The following functions in the `tanton_engine` crate are unsound due to lack of sufficient boundary
  checks in public API:

  - `Stack::offset()`
  - `ThreadStack::get()`
  - `RootMoveList::insert_score_depth()`
  - `RootMoveList::insert_score()`

  The tanton_engine crate is no longer maintained, so there are no plans to fix this issue.
