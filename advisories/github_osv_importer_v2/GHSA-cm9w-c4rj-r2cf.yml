summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in view_component
  This is an XSS vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display.

  Versions 2.29.1 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability.

  Avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.
