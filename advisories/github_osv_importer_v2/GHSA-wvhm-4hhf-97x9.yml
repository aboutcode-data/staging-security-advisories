summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting in Prism
  ### Impact
  The easing preview of the Previewers plugin has an XSS vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in Safari and Internet Explorer.

  This impacts all Safari and Internet Explorer users of Prism >=v1.1.0 that use the _Previewers_ plugin (>=v1.10.0) or the _Previewer: Easing_ plugin (v1.1.0 to v1.9.0).

  ### Patches
  This problem is patched in v1.21.0.

  ### Workarounds
  To workaround the issue without upgrading, [disable the easing preview](https://prismjs.com/plugins/previewers/#disabling-a-previewer) on all impacted code blocks. You need Prism v1.10.0 or newer to apply this workaround.
