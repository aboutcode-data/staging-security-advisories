aliases:
  - CVE-2022-43434
summary: |
  Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by Jenkins NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin
  Jenkins sets the Content-Security-Policy header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

  NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.20 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins whenever the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' build step is executed. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

  Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url) configured are unaffected.
