  - CVE-2021-3978
summary: "Improper Preservation of Permissions in github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/cmd/octorpki\n\
  ### Impact\n\nWhen copying files with rsync, octorpki uses the \"-a\" flag 0, which forces\
  \ rsync to copy binaries with the suid bit set as root. Since the provided service definition\
  \ defaults to root (https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/blob/master/package/octorpki.service)\
  \ this could allow for a vector, when combined with another vulnerability that causes octorpki\
  \ to process a malicious TAL file, for a local privilege escalation.  \n\n## For more information\n\
  \nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at security@cloudflare.com"
