summary: "sigstore has insufficient validation of integration timestamp during verification\n\
  ### Summary\n\nVersions of sigstore-python newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0 perform insufficient\
  \ validation of the \"integration time\" present in \"v2\" and \"v3\" bundles during the verification\
  \ flow: the \"integration time\" is verified *if* a source of signed time (such as an inclusion\
  \ promise) is present, but is otherwise trusted if no source of signed time is present.\n\n\
  This does not affect \"v1\" bundles, as the \"v1\" bundle format always requires an inclusion\
  \ promise.\n\n### Details\n\nSigstore uses signed time to support verification of signatures\
  \ made against short-lived signing keys. \n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact and severity of this\
  \ weakness is *low*, as Sigstore contains multiple other enforcing components that prevent\
  \ an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp within a bundle from impersonating a\
  \ valid signature. In particular, an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp can induce\
  \ a Denial of Service, but in no different manner than already possible with bundle access\
  \ (e.g. modifying the signature itself such that it fails to verify).\n\nSeparately, an attacker\
  \ could upload a *new* entry to the transparency service, and substitute their new entry's\
  \ time. However, this would still be rejected at validation time, as the new entry's (valid)\
  \ signed time would be outside the validity window of the original signing certificate and\
  \ would nonetheless render the attacker auditable."
