summary: |
  Sensitive Information leak via Script File in TinaCMS
  ### Impact

  Sensitive Information leaked via script File in TinaCMS. Sites building with @tinacms/cli >= 1.0.0 && < 1.0.9 that store sensitive values in process.env var are impacted. If you're on a version prior to 1.0.0 this vulnerability does not affect you.

  If your Tina-enabled website has sensitive credentials stored as environment variables (eg. Algolia API keys) you should rotate those keys immediately.

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.0.9

  ### Workarounds

  Upgrading, and rotating secure & exposed keys is required for the proper fix.
