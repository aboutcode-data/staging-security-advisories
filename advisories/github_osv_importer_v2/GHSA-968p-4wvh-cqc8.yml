summary: |
  Babel has inefficient RegExp complexity in generated code with .replace when transpiling named capturing groups
  ### Impact

  When using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).

  Your generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:
  - You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)
  - You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups
  - **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**

  If you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:
  - you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23
  - you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10

  You can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).


  ### Patches

  This problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.

  Please note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.

  ### Workarounds

  If you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).
