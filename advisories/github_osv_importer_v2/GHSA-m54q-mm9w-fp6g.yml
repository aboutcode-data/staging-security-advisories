  - CVE-2025-55304
summary: |
  Exiv2 has quadratic performance in ICC profile parsing in JpegBase::readMetadata
  ### Impact
  A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.5: a quadratic algorithm in the ICC profile parsing code in `jpegBase::readMetadata()` can cause Exiv2 to run for a long time. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted jpg image file.

  ### Patches
  The bug is fixed in version v0.28.6.
