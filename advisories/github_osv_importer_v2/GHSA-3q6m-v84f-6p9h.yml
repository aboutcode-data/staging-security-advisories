summary: |
  quic-go vulnerable to pointer dereference that can lead to panic
  quic-go is an implementation of the [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000) transport protocol in Go. By serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space.

  **Impact**

  An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets.

  **Patches**

  [v0.37.3](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.37.3) contains a patch. Versions before v0.37.0 are not affected.
