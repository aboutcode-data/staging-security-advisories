summary: "Sydent does not verify email server certificates\n## Impact\n\nIf configured to send\
  \ emails using TLS, Sydent does not verify SMTP servers' certificates. This makes  Sydent's\
  \ emails vulnerable to interception via a [man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).\
  \ Attackers with privileged access to the network can intercept room invitations and address\
  \ confirmation emails.\n\nCVSS 3.1 overall score: 3.3 - [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/CR:L/IR:L/AR:X/MAV:A/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:C/MC:L/MI:L/MA:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/CR:L/IR:L/AR:X/MAV:A/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:C/MC:L/MI:L/MA:N&version=3.1)\n\
  \n_Reported by Martin Schobert, [Pentagrid AG](https://pentagrid.ch/)._\n\n### Details\n\n\
  Sydent can be configured to send emails over a TLS-encrypted socket by setting\n\n```yaml\n\
  email:\n    tlsmode: \"TLS\"  # or the legacy value \"SSL\"\n```\n\nin its config file. Alternatively\
  \ it can be configured to use [Opportunistic TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS)\
  \ by setting\n\n```yaml\nemail:\n    tlsmode: \"STARTTLS\"\n```\n\nIn both situations, Sydent\
  \ will encrypt its communication with the SMTP server when sending emails. **In affected versions,\
  \ Sydent will not verify the destination server's certificate.**\n\n### Vulnerability \n\n\
  Sydent sends email for two purposes:\n- to inform a third party that they have been invited\
  \ to a Matrix room by their email address; and\n- to verify that a given Matrix user controls\
  \ an email address.\n\nTherefore, attackers capable of running a MITM attack can\n\n1. Intercept\
  \ room invitations sent to an email address. The invitation includes \n   - the room ID and\
  \ its avatar, and\n   - the inviter's username, displayname and their avatar, and\n   - credentials\
  \ for a guest Matrix account on the inviter's homeserver.\n2. Intercept address ownership\
  \ confirmation emails. This would allow the attacker to falsely claim ownership of the indented\
  \ recipient's Matrix account, if that account was permitted to log in using an email address\
  \ and no other authentication factors.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is patched in [Sydent 2.5.6](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.6),\
  \ see PR https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/574.\n\nWhen patching, make sure that Sydent\
  \ trusts the certificate of the server it is connecting to. This should happen automatically\
  \ when using properly issued certificates. If you are using self-signed certificates, make\
  \ sure to copy your Certification Authority certificate, or your self signed certificate if\
  \ using only one, to the trust store of your operating system.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOne can\
  \ ensure Sydent's emails fail to send by setting the configured SMTP server to a loopback\
  \ or [non-routable](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918#section-3) address under\
  \ your control which does not have a listening SMTP server. For example:\n\n```yaml\nemail:\n\
  \    smtphost: \"localhost\"  # Assuming there is no SMTP server listening on localhost\n\
  ```\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/574 implements the fix.\n\
