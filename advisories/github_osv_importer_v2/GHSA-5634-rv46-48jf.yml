  Cross-Site Scripting in bleach
  All versions of `bleach` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. It is possible to bypass the package's HTML sanitization with payloads such as `"<<script><</script>script>alert('xss');</<script><</script>script>"` regardless of the passed options. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
