  - CVE-2021-39144
summary: |
  XStream is vulnerable to a Remote Command Execution attack
  ### Impact
  The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker has sufficient rights to execute commands of the host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.

  ### Patches
  XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.

  ### Workarounds
  See [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.

  ### References
  See full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39144](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39144.html).
