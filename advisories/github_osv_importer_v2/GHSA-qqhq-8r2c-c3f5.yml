  nvdApiKey is logged in debug mode
  ### Summary
  The value of `nvdApiKey` configuration parameter is logged in clear text in debug mode.

  ### Details
  The NVD API key is a kind of secret and should be treated like other secrets when logging in debug mode.
  Expecting the same behavior as for several password configurations: just print `******`

  Note that while the NVD API Key is an access token for the NVD API - they are not that sensitive. The only thing an NVD API Token grants is a higher rate limit when making calls to publicly available data. The data available from the NVD API is the same whether you have an API Key or not.

  ### PoC
  The nvdApiKey is configured to use an environment variable; when running `mvn -X dependency-check:check` the clear value is logged twice.

  ### Impact
  The NVD API key is a kind of secret and should not be exposed. If stolen, an attacker can use this key to obtain already public information.
