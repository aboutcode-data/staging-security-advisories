  - CVE-2023-6180
summary: |
  tokio-boring vulnerable to resource exhaustion via memory leak
  ### Impact
  The tokio-boring library in version 4.0.0 is affected by a memory leak issue that can lead to excessive resource consumption and potential DoS by resource exhaustion. The `set_ex_data` function used by the library did not deallocate memory used by pre-existing data in memory each time after completing a TLS connection causing the program to consume more resources with each new connection.

  ### Patches
  The issue is fixed in version 4.1.0 of tokio-boring.
