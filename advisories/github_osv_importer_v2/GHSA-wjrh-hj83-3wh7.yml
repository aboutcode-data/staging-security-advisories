summary: |
  Django-Select2 Vulnerable to Widget Instance Secret Cache Key Leaking
  ### Impact

  Instances of `HeavySelect2Mixin` subclasses like the `ModelSelect2MultipleWidget` and `ModelSelect2Widget` can secret access tokens across requests. This can allow users to access restricted querysets and restricted data.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been patched in version 8.4.1 and all following versions.

  ### Workarounds

  This vulnerability is limited use cases where instances of widget classes are created during app loading (not during a request).

  Example of affected code:
  ```python
  class MyForm(forms.ModelForm):
      class Meta:
          widgets = {"my_select_field": Select2ModelWidget()}
  ```

  Django allows you to pass just the widget class (not the instance). This can be used to mitigate the session request leak.

  Example of affected code:
  ```python
  class MyForm(forms.ModelForm):
      class Meta:
          widgets = {"my_select_field": Select2ModelWidget}
  ```
