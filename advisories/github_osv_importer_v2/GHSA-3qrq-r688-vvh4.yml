summary: |
  Multiple valid tokens for password reset in Shopware
  ### Impact
  Multiple tokens for password reset could be requested. All tokens could be used to change the password.
  This makes it possible for an attacker to take over the victims account if s/he gains access to the victims email account and finds unused password reset token in the emails within the time frame of two hours.

  ### Patches
  We recommend updating to the current version 5.7.9. You can get the update to 5.7.9 regularly via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview.
