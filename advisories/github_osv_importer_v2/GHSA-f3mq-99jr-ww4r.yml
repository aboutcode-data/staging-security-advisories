aliases:
  - CVE-2020-36467
summary: |
  Multiple soundness issues in cgc
  Affected versions of this crate have the following issues:

  1. `Ptr` implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types, this can lead to data
     races by sending non-thread safe types across threads.

  2. `Ptr::get` violates mutable alias rules by returning multiple mutable
     references to the same object.

  3. `Ptr::write` uses non-atomic writes to the underlying pointer. This means
     that when used across threads it can lead to data races.
