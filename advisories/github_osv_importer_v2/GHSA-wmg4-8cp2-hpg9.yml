  - CVE-2021-29430
summary: |
  Sydent vulnerable to denial of service attack via memory exhaustion
  ### Impact

  Sydent does not limit the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to disk space exhaustion and denial of service.

  Sydent also does not limit response size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.

  This affects any server which accepts registration requests from untrusted clients.

  ### Patches

  Patched by 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3.

  ### Workarounds

  Request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy.

  There are no known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.
