  - CVE-2025-66516
summary: "Apache Tika has XXE vulnerability\nCritical XXE in Apache Tika tika-core (1.13-3.2.1),\
  \ tika-pdf-module (2.0.0-3.2.1) and tika-parsers (1.13-1.28.5) modules on all platforms allows\
  \ an attacker to carry out XML External Entity injection via a crafted XFA file inside of\
  \ a PDF. \n\nThis CVE covers the same vulnerability as in CVE-2025-54988. However, this CVE\
  \ expands the scope of affected packages in two ways. \n\nFirst, while the entrypoint for\
  \ the vulnerability was the tika-parser-pdf-module as reported in CVE-2025-54988, the vulnerability\
  \ and its fix were in tika-core. Users who upgraded the tika-parser-pdf-module but did not\
  \ upgrade tika-core to >= 3.2.2 would still be vulnerable. \n\nSecond, the original report\
  \ failed to mention that in the 1.x Tika releases, the PDFParser was in the \"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers\"\
  \ module."
