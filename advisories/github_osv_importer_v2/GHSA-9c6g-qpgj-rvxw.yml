summary: "Streamlit publishes previously-patched Cross-site Scripting vulnerability\n**Synopsis:**\
  \  Streamlit open source publicizes a prior security fix implemented in 2021. The vulnerability\
  \ affected Streamlit versions between 0.63.0 and 0.80.0 (inclusive) and was patched on April\
  \ 21, 2021.  If you are using Streamlit with version before 0.63.0 or after 0.80.0, no action\
  \ is required. \n# 1. Impacted Products\nStreamilt Open Source versions between 0.63.0 and\
  \ 0.80.0.\n# 2. Introduction\nOn April 21, 2021, Streamlit merged a patch that fixed a cross-site\
  \ scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Streamlit open source library, without an associated\
  \ public advisory.  The vulnerability affected Streamlit versions between 0.63.0 and 0.80.0\
  \ (inclusive), which are no longer supported. We recommend using the latest version of our\
  \ library, but so long as you are not using an affected Streamlit version, no action is required.\
  \ \n# 3. Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability \n## 3.1 Description\nOn April 20, 2021, Streamlit\
  \ was informed via our support forum about a XSS vulnerability in the open source library.\
  \ We fixed and merged a patch remediating the vulnerability on April 21st, 2021. The issue\
  \ was determined to be in the moderate severity range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of\
  \ [5.9](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)\n\
  ## 3.2 Scenarios and attack vector(s)\nUsers of hosted Streamlit app(s) were vulnerable to\
  \ a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious URL with Javascript payloads\
  \ to a Streamlit app. The attacker could then trick the user into visiting the malicious URL\
  \ and, if successful, the server would render the malicious javascript payload as-is, leading\
  \ to an XSS. \n## 3.3 Our response\nStreamlit fixed and merged a patch for this vulnerability\
  \ on April 21, 2021. The vulnerability was fixed within 24hrs of notification to Streamlit.\
  \ \n## 3.4 Resolution\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in all Streamlit versions released\
  \ since April 21, 2021.  The affected versions – those between 0.63.0 and 0.80.0 (inclusive)\
  \ – are no longer supported. We recommend always using supported versions of the Streamlit\
  \ open source library. Version 1.19.0 is current as of this advisory. \n# 4. Contact\nPlease\
