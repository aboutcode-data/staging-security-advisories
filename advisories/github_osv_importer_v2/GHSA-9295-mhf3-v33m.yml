summary: |
  Insecure temporary file in Netflix OSS Hollow
  > ID: NFLX-2021-001
  > Title: Local information disclosure in Hollow
  > Release Date: 2021-03-23
  > Credit: Security Researcher @JLLeitschuh

  # Overview

  Security researcher @JLLeitschuh reported that Netflix Hollow (a Netflix OSS project available here: https://github.com/Netflix/hollow) writes to a local temporary directory before validating the permissions on it.

  # Impact

  An attacker with the ability to create directories and set permissions on the local filesystem could pre-create this directory and read or modify anything written there by the Hollow process.

  # Description

  Since the `Files.exists(parent)` is run before creating the directories, an attacker can pre-create these directories with wide permissions. Additionally, since an insecure source of randomness is used, the file names to be created can be deterministically calculated.

  # Workarounds and Fixes

  Avoid running Hollow in configurations that share a filesystem with less-trusted processes. May be fixed in a future release.
