  Cross-site Scripting in invenio-previewer
  ## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in JSON, Markdown and iPython Notebook previewers

  ### Impact
  Several Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been found in the JSON, Markdown and iPython Notebook previewers. The vulnerabilities would allow a malicous user to upload a JSON, Markdown or Notebook file with embedded scripts that would be executed by a victims browser.

  ### Patches
  Invenio-Previewer v1.0.0a12 fixes the issue.

  ### Workarounds
  You can remediate the vulnerability without upgrading by disabling the affected previewers. You do this by adding the following to your configuration:

  ```python
  PREVIEWER_PREFERENCE = [
      'csv_dthreejs',
      'simple_image',
      # 'json_prismjs',
      'xml_prismjs',
      # 'mistune',
      'pdfjs',
      # 'ipynb',
      'zip',
  ]
  ```

  Afterwards, you should not be able to preview JSON, Markdown or iPython Notebook files.
