summary: |
  Drainage of FeeCollector's Block Transaction Fees in cronos
  ### Impact
  In Cronos nodes running versions before v0.6.5, it is possible to take transaction fees from Cosmos SDK's FeeCollector for the current block by sending a custom crafted MsgEthereumTx.

  User funds and balances are safe.


  ### Patches
  This problem has been patched in Cronos v0.6.5 on the mempool level.
  The next network upgrade with consensus-breaking changes will patch it on the consensus level.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no tested workarounds. All validator node operators are recommended to upgrade to Cronos v0.6.5 at their earliest possible convenience.

  ### Credits
  Thank you to @zb3 for reporting this issue on [Cronos Immunefi Bug Bounty Program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/), to @cyril-crypto for reproducing the issue and to @yihuang and @thomas-nguy for patching the issue on the CheckTx (mempool) and the DeliverTx (consensus) levels.
