aliases:
  - CVE-2021-32662
summary: |
  Path traversal
  ### Impact

  A malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API.

  This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.
