summary: "PowSyBl Core contains Polynomial REDoS’es\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability\
  \ is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is an advisory for a **potential polynomial Regular Expression\
  \ Denial of Service (ReDoS)** vulnerability in the PowSyBl's DataSource mechanism. When the\
  \ `listNames(String regex)` method is called on a DataSource, the user-supplied regular expression\
  \ (which may be unvalidated) is compiled and evaluated against a collection of file-like resource\
  \ names.\n\nTo trigger a **polynomial ReDoS** via this mechanism, **two attacker-controlled\
  \ conditions** must be met:\n- **Control over the regex input** passed into `listNames(String\
  \ regex)`.\n  - _Example:_ An attacker supplies a malicious pattern like `(.*a){10000}`.\n\
  - **Control or influence over the file/resource names** being matched.\n  - _Example:_ Filenames\
  \ such as `\"aaaa...!\"` that induce regex engine backtracking.\n\nIf both conditions are\
  \ satisfied, a malicious actor can cause **significant CPU consumption** due to regex backtracking\
  \ — even\nwith polynomial patterns. Since both inputs can be controlled via a publicly accessible\
  \ method or external filesystem handling,\nthe `listNames(String regex)` method is considered\
  \ vulnerable to polynomial **REDoS**.\n\nUnlike classic _catastrophic exponential_ ReDoS,\
  \ this subtle attack exploits a greedy `.*` prefix followed by a fixed suffix, repeated multiple\
  \ times.  \nWhen applied to long filenames that almost match the pattern, the regex engine\
  \ performs extensive backtracking, degrading performance predictably with input size. In a\
  \ multi-tenant environment, an attacker can degrade the performance - and thereby the availability\
  \ - of the server to an extent that it affects other users of the application. This can for\
  \ example be useful if an attacker wants to delay other users in a scenario where a time advantage\
  \ can be a competitive advantage.  \nA tricky part in this is that the attacker needs to control\
  \ both the pattern and the input which may not always be the case.\n\n#### Am I impacted?\n\
  You are vulnerable if you make direct calls to the `listNames(String regex)` method on a class\
  \ implementing the `ReadOnlyDataSource` interface, don't control the regular expression used\
  \ as `regex` parameter, and if this datasource points to an archive or directory where an\
  \ untrusted user may edit the filenames.\nFor instance, this could be the case if you want\
  \ to list the files made available by a datasource which names respect a user-provided regular\
  \ expression.\nNote that only direct calls to this method are concerned. There are several\
  \ usages of this method in powsybl, but the provided regular expressions are all hardcoded\
  \ and therefore cannot be provided by a malicious user.\n\n### Patches\ncom.powsybl:powsybl-commons:6.7.2\
