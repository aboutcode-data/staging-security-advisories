summary: "LibreNMS has Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in \"Alert Templates\" feature\n\
  ### Summary\nA Self Cross-Site Scripting (Self-XSS) vulnerability in the \"Alert Templates\"\
  \ feature allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the alert template's name. This\
  \ script executes immediately upon submission but does not persist after a page refresh.\n\
  \n### Details\nThe vulnerability occurs when creating an alert template in the LibreNMS interface.\
  \ Although the application sanitizes the \"name\" field when storing it in the database, this\
  \ newly created template is immediately added to the table without any sanitization being\
  \ applied to the name, allowing users to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This script executes\
  \ when the template is created but does not persist in the database, thus preventing stored\
  \ XSS.\n\nFor instance, the following payload can be used to exploit the vulnerability:\n\
  ```test1<script>{onerror=alert}throw 1337</script>```\n\nThe root cause of this vulnerability\
  \ lies in the lack of sanitization of the \"name\" variable before it is rendered in the table.\
  \ The vulnerability exists because the bootgrid function of the jQuery grid plugin does not\
  \ sanitize the text being added to the table. Although tags are stripped before being added\
  \ to the database (as shown in the code below), the vulnerability still allows Self-XSS during\
  \ the creation of the template.\n\nWhere the variable is being sanitized before being stored\
  \ in the database:\nhttps://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/0e741e365aa974a74aee6b43d1b4b759158a5c7e/includes/html/forms/alert-templates.inc.php#L40\n\
  \nWhere the vulnerability is happening:\nhttps://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/0e741e365aa974a74aee6b43d1b4b759158a5c7e/includes/html/modal/alert_template.inc.php#L205\
  \ \n\n### PoC\n1. Navigate to the \"Alert Templates\" creation page in the LibreNMS interface.\n\
  2. In the \"Name\" field, input the following payload:\n```test1<script>{onerror=alert}throw\
  \ 1337</script>```\n3. Submit the form to create the alert template.\n4. Observe that the\
  \ JavaScript executes immediately, triggering an alert popup. However, this code does not\
  \ persist after refreshing the page.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a Self Cross-Site Scripting (Self-XSS)\
  \ vulnerability. Although the risk is lower compared to traditional XSS, it can still be exploited\
  \ through social engineering or tricking users into entering or interacting with malicious\
  \ code. This can lead to unauthorized actions or data exposure in the context of the affected\
  \ user's session."
