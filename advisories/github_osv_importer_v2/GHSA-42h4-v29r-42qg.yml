summary: |
  yt-dlp on Windows vulnerable to `--exec` command injection when using `%q`
  ### Impact
  [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) allows the user to provide shell commands to be executed at various stages in its download process through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that video metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell.

  However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) did not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`.

  Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version [2021.04.11](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2021.04.11).

  ### Patches
  yt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special character.
  `\n` will be replaced by `\r`, as no way of escaping it has been found.

  ### Workarounds
  It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous.

  For Windows users who are not able to upgrade:
  - Avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath).
  - If expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `"`, `|` or `&`.
  - Instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.
