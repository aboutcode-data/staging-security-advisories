  - CVE-2024-27101
summary: |
  Integer overflow in chunking helper causes dispatching to miss elements or panic
  Any SpiceDB cluster with any schema where a resource being checked has more than 65535 relationships for the same resource and subject type is affected by this problem.

  The issue may also lead to a panic rendering the server unavailable

  The following API methods are affected:
  - [CheckPermission](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.CheckPermission)
  - [BulkCheckPermission](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.ExperimentalService.BulkCheckPermission)
  - [LookupSubjects](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.LookupSubjects)

  #### Impact

  Permission checks that are expected to be allowed are instead denied, and lookup subjects will return fewer subjects than expected.

  #### Workarounds

  There is no workaround other than making sure that the SpiceDB cluster does not have very wide relations, with the maximum value being the maximum value of an 16-bit unsigned integer
