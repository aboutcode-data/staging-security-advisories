  Cross-Site Scripting in semantic-ui-search
  All versions of `semantic-ui-search` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Lack of output encoding on the selection dropdowns can lead to user input being executed instead of printed as text.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
