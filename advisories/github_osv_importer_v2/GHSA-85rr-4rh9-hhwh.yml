  - CVE-2020-26243
summary: |
  Memory leak in Nanopb
  ### Impact
  Decoding specifically formed message can leak memory if dynamic allocation is enabled and an oneof field contains a static submessage that contains a dynamic field, and the message being decoded contains the submessage multiple times. This is rare in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed.

  ### Patches
  Preliminary patch is [available on git](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/commit/edf6dcbffee4d614ac0c2c1b258ab95185bdb6e9) and problem will be patched in versions 0.3.9.7 and 0.4.4 once testing has been completed.

  ### Workarounds
  Following workarounds are available:
  * Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This will generate fields as separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic code.
  * Set the type of the submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This way the whole submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematic code is not executed.
  * Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sure all memory can be released afterwards.
