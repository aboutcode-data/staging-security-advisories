summary: "Kyverno resource with a deletionTimestamp may allow policy circumvention\n### Impact\n\
  \nIn versions of Kyverno prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field\
  \ defined can bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where\
  \ the `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. \n\nThis situation occurs as resources\
  \ pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce processing\
  \ load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being deleted. \n\nHowever,\
  \ this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to leverage the [Kubernetes finalizers\
  \ feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/)\
  \ by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp`\
  \ and then not completing the delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno\
  \ policy. \n\nNote that this is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes\
  \ Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies.\n\n\
  \n### Patches\nThis is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no known workaround.\n\
  \n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_"
