summary: "Command Injection in ascii-art\nVersions of `ascii-art` before 1.4.4 are vulnerable\
  \ to command injection. This is exploitable when user input is passed into the argument of\
  \ the `ascii-art preview` command. \n\n\nExample Proof of concept:\n`ascii-art preview 'doom\"\
  ; touch /tmp/malicious; echo \"'`\n\nGiven that the input is passed on the command line and\
  \ none of the api methods are vulnerable to this,  the likely exploitation vector is when\
  \ the ascii-art comment is being called programmatically using something like `execFile`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.4.4 or later."
