  - CVE-2020-36450
summary: "Data races in bunch\nAn issue was discovered in the bunch crate through 2020-11-12\
  \ for Rust. \nAffected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` for\
  \ `Bunch<T>`.\nThis allows users to insert `T: !Sync` to `Bunch<T>`. It is possible to create\
  \ a data race to a `T: !Sync` by invoking the `Bunch::get()` API (which returns `&T`) from\
  \ multiple threads. It is also possible to send `T: !Send` to other threads by inserting `T`\
  \ inside `Bunch<T>` and sending `Bunch<T>` to another thread, allowing to create a data race\
  \ by inserting types like `T = Rc<_>`.\n\nSuch data races can lead to memory corruption."
