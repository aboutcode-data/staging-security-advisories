summary: "Graylog Allows Session Takeover via Insufficient HTML Sanitization\n### Impact\nIt\
  \ is possible to obtain user session cookies by submitting an HTML form as part of an Event\
  \ Definition Remediation Step field. \nFor this attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user\
  \ account with permissions to create event definitions, while the user must have permissions\
  \ to view alerts. Additionally, an active Input must be present on the Graylog server that\
  \ is capable of receiving form data (e.g. a HTTP input, TCP raw or syslog etc).\n\n### Patches\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nNone, as long as the relatively rare prerequisites are met.\n\nAnalysis\
