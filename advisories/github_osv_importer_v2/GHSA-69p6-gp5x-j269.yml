aliases:
  - CVE-2024-29069
summary: In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the destination of
  symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system image and
  so can contain symbolic links and other file types. Various file entries within the snap squashfs
  image (such as icons and desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted.
  An attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which contained symbolic
  links at these paths could then cause snapd to write out the contents of the symbolic link
  destination into a world-readable directory. This in-turn could allow an unprivileged user
  to gain access to privileged information.
