summary: |
  OpenBao leaks HTTPRawBody in Audit Logs
  ### Impact

  OpenBao's audit log experienced a regression wherein raw HTTP bodies used by few endpoints were not correctly redacted (HMAC'd).  This impacted the following subsystems:

   - When using the ACME functionality of PKI, this would result in short-lived ACME verification challenge codes being leaked in the audit logs.
   - When using the OIDC issuer functionality of the identity subsystem, auth and token response codes along with claims could be leaked in the audit logs.

  Third-party plugins may be affected.

  ### Patches

  OpenBao v2.4.2 will patch this issue.

  ### Workarounds

  If users do not use the above functionality, they are not impacted. ACME verification codes are not usable after verification or challenge expiry so are of limited long-term use.
