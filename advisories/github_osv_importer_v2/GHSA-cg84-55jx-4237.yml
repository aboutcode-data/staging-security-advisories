summary: "eZ Platform Password reset vulnerability\nThis Security Update fixes a severe vulnerability\
  \ in the eZ Platform Admin UI, and we recommend that you install it as soon as possible. It\
  \ affects eZ Platform 2.x.\n \nThe functionality for resetting a forgotten password is vulnerable\
  \ to brute force attack. Depending on configuration and other circumstances an attacker may\
  \ exploit this to gain control over user accounts. The update ensures such an attack is exceedingly\
  \ unlikely to succeed.\n \nYou may want to consider a configuration change to further strengthen\
  \ your security. By default a password reset request is valid for 1 hour. Reducing this time\
  \ will make attacks even more difficult, but ensure there is enough time left to account for\
  \ email delivery delays, and user delays. See documentation at https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/user_management/#changing-and-recovering-passwords\n\
  \nTo install, use Composer to update to one of the \"Resolving versions\" mentioned above.\
  \ If you use eZ Platform 2.5, update ezsystems/ezplatform-user to v1.0.1. If you use eZ Platform\
  \ 2.4, update ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui to v1.4.6, and ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui-modules\
  \ to v1.4.4, and ezsystems/repository-forms to v2.4.5)"
