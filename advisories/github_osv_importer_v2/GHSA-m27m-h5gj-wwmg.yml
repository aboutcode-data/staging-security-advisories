aliases:
  - CVE-2024-39933
summary: |
  Gogs allows argument Injection when tagging new releases
  ### Impact

  Unprivileged user accounts with at least one SSH key can read arbitrary files on the system. For instance, they could leak the configuration files that could contain database credentials (`[database] *`) and `[security] SECRET_KEY`. Attackers could also exfiltrate TLS certificates, other users' repositories, and the Gogs database when the SQLite driver is enabled.

  ### Patches

  Unintended Git options has been ignored for creating tags (https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/7872). Users should upgrade to 0.13.1 or the latest 0.14.0+dev.

  ### Workarounds

  No viable workaround available, please only grant access to trusted users to your Gogs instance on affected versions.
