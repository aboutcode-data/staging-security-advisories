  - CVE-2021-29484
summary: "DOM XSS in Theme Preview\n### Impact\nAn unused endpoint added during the development\
  \ of 4.0.0 has left sites vulnerable to untrusted users gaining access to Ghost Admin. Attackers\
  \ can gain access by getting logged in users to click a link containing malicious code. Users\
  \ do not need to enter credentials and may not know they've visited a malicious site. \n\n\
  Ghost(Pro) has already been patched. We can find no evidence that the issue was exploited\
  \ on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added. \n\nSelf-hosters are impacted if running Ghost\
  \ a version between 4.0.0 and 4.3.2. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site\
  \ - see patches & workarounds below.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in 4.3.3, all 4.x sites should\
  \ upgrade as soon as possible.\nAs the endpoint is unused, the patch simply removes it. \n\
  \n### Workarounds\n- Log out of Ghost Admin\n- Suspend any users who cannot log out\n- Block\
  \ access to `/ghost/preview`\n\nExample of how to block access in nginx:\n\n```\nlocation\
  \ ~ /ghost/preview {\n    rewrite ^(\\/(.*\\/)?ghost\\/)(.*)$ $1 redirect;\n}\n```\n\nThis\
  \ redirects the endpoint to `/ghost/`, which mimics the behaviour after the patch is applied.\n\
