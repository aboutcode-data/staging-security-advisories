  Duplicate Advisory: Svix vulnerable to improper comparison of different-length signatures
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-747x-5m58-mq97. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  The `Webhook::verify` function incorrectly compared signatures of different lengths - the two signatures would only be compared up to the length of the shorter signature. This allowed an attacker to pass in `v1,` as the signature, which would always pass verification.
