  - CVE-2016-10599
summary: "sauce-connect downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `sauce-connect`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `sauce-connect`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this\
  \ vulnerability, and this package has not been updated since 2013.\n\nThe best mitigation\
  \ is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively,\
  \ the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while\
  \ connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only\
  \ people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or\
  \ those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
