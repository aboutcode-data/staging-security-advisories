summary: "keyget vulnerable to prototype pollution\n### Overview\nPrototype pollution vulnerability\
  \ in 'keyget' versions 1.0.0 through 2.2.0 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and\
  \ may lead to remote code execution.\n\n### Details\nThe npm module 'keyget' can be abused\
  \ by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function 'setByPath()' did not check for\
  \ the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker\
  \ could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial\
  \ of Service or potentially Remote code execution.\n\n### PoC Details\nThe `setByPath()` function\
  \ accepts three arguments `target, path, value`. Due to the absence of validation, at values\
  \ passed into `path, value` an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the `path`\
  \ value to include the `__proto__` property. Since there is no validation before assigning\
  \ property to check whether the assigned `path` is the Object's own property or not, the property\
  \ `polluted` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object\
  \ prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the value would\
  \ be substituted as \"true\" as it had been polluted.\n\n### PoC Code\n```js\nvar keyget =\
  \ require(\"keyget\")\n keyget.set({}, '__proto__.polluted', 'true');\n console.log(polluted);\
  \ \n```"
