  OpenClaw optional voice-call plugin: webhook verification may be bypassed behind certain proxy configurations
  ## Affected Packages / Versions

  This issue affects the optional voice-call plugin only. It is not enabled by default; it only applies to installations where the plugin is installed and enabled.

  - Package: `@openclaw/voice-call`
  - Vulnerable versions: `< 2026.2.3`
  - Patched versions: `>= 2026.2.3`

  Legacy package name (if you are still using it):

  - Package: `@clawdbot/voice-call`
  - Vulnerable versions: `<= 2026.1.24`
  - Patched versions: none published under this package name; migrate to `@openclaw/voice-call`

  ## Summary

  In certain reverse-proxy / forwarding setups, webhook verification can be bypassed if untrusted forwarded headers are accepted.

  ## Impact

  An external party may be able to send voice-call webhook requests that are accepted as valid, which can result in spoofed webhook events being processed.

  ## Root Cause

  Some deployments implicitly trusted forwarded headers (for example `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-*`) when determining request properties used during webhook verification. If those headers are not overwritten by a trusted proxy, a client can supply them directly and influence verification.

  ## Resolution

  Ignore forwarded headers by default unless explicitly trusted and allowlisted in configuration. Keep any loopback-only development bypass restricted to local development only. Upgrade to a patched version.

  If you cannot upgrade immediately, strip `Forwarded` and `X-Forwarded-*` headers at the edge so clients cannot supply them directly.
