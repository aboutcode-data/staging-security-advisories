  - CVE-2024-53847
summary: "Trix editor subject to XSS vulnerabilities on copy & paste\nThe Trix editor, in versions\
  \ prior to 2.1.9 and 1.3.3, is vulnerable to XSS + mutation XSS attacks when pasting malicious\
  \ code.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker could trick a user to copy and paste malicious code that\
  \ would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially\
  \ leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nUpdate Recommendation: Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.9\
  \ or later, which uses [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to sanitize the pasted\
  \ content. \n\nIf using Trix 1.x, upgrade to version 1.3.3 or later.\n\n### Mitigations\n\n\
  This is not really a workaround but something that should be considered in addition to upgrading\
  \ to the patched version. If affected users can disallow browsers that don't support a Content\
  \ Security Policy, then this would be an effective workaround for this and all XSS vulnerabilities.\
  \ Set CSP policies such as script-src 'self' to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same\
  \ origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using script-src-elem.\n\n###\
  \ References\n\nThe XSS vulnerability was reported by HackerOne researcher [hiumee](https://hackerone.com/hiumee?type=user).\n\
  The mutation XSS vulnerability was reported by HackerOne researcher [sudi](https://hackerone.com/sudi?type=user)."
