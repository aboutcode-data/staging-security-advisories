summary: "Microsoft: CBC Padding Oracle in Azure Blob Storage Encryption Library\n### Summary\n\
  \nThe Azure Storage Encryption library in Java and other languages is vulnerable to a CBC\
  \ Padding Oracle attack, similar to CVE-2020-8911. The library is not vulnerable to the equivalent\
  \ of CVE-2020-8912, but only because it currently only supports AES-CBC as encryption mode.\
  \ \n\n### Severity\n\nModerate - The vulnerability poses insider risks/privilege escalation\
  \ risks, circumventing controls for stored data.\n\n### Further Analysis\nThe Java Azure Blob\
  \ Storage Encryption SDK is impacted by an issue that can result in loss of confidentiality\
  \ and message forgery. The attack requires write access to the container in question, and\
  \ that the attacker has access to an endpoint that reveals decryption failures (without revealing\
  \ the plaintext) and that when encrypting the CBC option was chosen as content cipher.\n\n\
  This advisory describes the plaintext revealing vulnerabilities in the Java Azure Blob Storage\
  \ Encryption SDK, with a similar issue in the other blob storage SDKs being present as well.\n\
  \nIn the current version of the Azure Blob Storage crypto SDK, the only algorithm option that\
  \ allows users to encrypt files is to AES-CBC, without computing a MAC on the data.\n\nThis\
  \ exposes a padding oracle vulnerability: If the attacker has write access to the blob container\
  \ bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to the key can decrypt a file\
  \ (without observing the file contents that the endpoint learns in the process), they can\
  \ reconstruct the plaintext with (on average) 128*length(plaintext) queries to the endpoint,\
  \ by exploiting CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5 padding\
  \ errors.\n\n### Timeline\n**Date reported**: March 29 2022\n**Date preview**: June 16 2022\n\
  **Date GA**: July 11 2022\n**Date disclosed**: July 17 2022"
