  - CVE-2016-10594
summary: "ipip downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `ipip` insecurely downloads\
  \ resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position,\
  \ they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity of impact for a\
  \ vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of the package itself,\
  \ it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all the way up to and including\
  \ remote code execution.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this\
  \ vulnerability, and the README states that the package is deprecated.\n\nThe best mitigation\
  \ is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively,\
  \ the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while\
  \ connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only\
  \ people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or\
  \ those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
