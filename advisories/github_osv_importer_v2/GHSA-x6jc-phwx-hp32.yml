summary: |
  Incus container environment configuration newline injection
  ### Summary
  A user with the ability to launch a container with a custom YAML configuration (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) can create an environment variable containing newlines, which can be used to add additional configuration items in the container’s `lxc.conf` due to the newline injection. This can allow adding arbitrary lifecycle hooks, ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution on the host.

  ### Details
  When passing environment variables in the config block of a new container, values are not checked for the presence of newlines [1], which can result in newline injection inside the generated container `lxc.conf`. This can be used to set arbitrary additional configuration items, such as `lxc.hook.pre-start`. By exploiting this, a user with the ability to launch a container with an arbitrary config can achieve arbitrary command execution as root on the host.

  Exploiting this issue on IncusOS requires a slight modification of the payload to change to a different writable directory for the validation step (e.g /tmp). This can be confirmed with a second container with /tmp mounted from the host (A privileged action for validation only).

  ### PoC
  A proof-of-concept script exploiting this vulnerability can be found attached, named environment_newline_injection.sh, showing arbitrary command execution, which will write a file to the root filesystem (`/newline_injection_command_exec_poc`)

  Manual Reproduction steps:
  1. Launch a new container with a configuration file containing a multiline YAML string as an environment variable value, such as in the listing below.
  2. Observe that the lxc.conf (`/run/incus/user-1000_poc/lxc.conf` in my case) contains an additional `lxc.hook.pre-start` item
  3. Observe the creation of the file in the host root directory, with contents proving command execution as root.

  ```
  incus launch images:alpine/edge --ephemeral poc << EOF
  config:
    environment.FOO: |-
      abc
      lxc.hook.pre-start = /bin/sh -c "id > /newline_injection_command_exec_poc"
  EOF
  ```

  ### Impact
  A user with the ability to launch a container with a custom YAML configuration (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) can achieve arbitrary command execution on the host.
