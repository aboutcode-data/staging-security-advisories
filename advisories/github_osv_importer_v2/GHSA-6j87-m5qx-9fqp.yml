  Craft CMS has Stored XSS in Table Field in its "Row Heading" Column Type
  A stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `editableTable.twig` component when using the `Row Heading` column type. The application fails to sanitize input within row headings, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript when another user views a page with the malicious table field.

  ## Prerequisites
  * An administrator account
  * `allowAdminChanges` must be enabled in production, which is [against security recommendations](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/securing-craft#set-allowAdminChanges-to-false-in-production).

  ## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Fields** and create a new field with Type: **Table**
  1. Add a **Column Heading** and set **Column Type** to `Row Heading`
  1. In **Default Values** section, add a row with the following payload:
      ```html
      <img src=x onerror="alert('XSS')">
      ```
  1. Enable `Static Rows`
  1. Use the field in any object (e.g., user profile fields) → then visit any user’s profile
  1. Notice the XSS execution
