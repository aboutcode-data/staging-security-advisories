summary: "Pepr Has Overly Permissive RBAC ClusterRole in Admin Mode\nSeverity: LOW\nTarget:\
  \ /workspace/pepr/src/lib/assets/rbac.ts\nEndpoint: Kubernetes RBAC configuration\nMethod:\
  \ Deployment\n\n## Response / Rationale\nPepr defaults to `rbacMode: \"admin\"` because the\
  \ initial experience is designed to be frictionless for new users. This mode ensures that\
  \ users can deploy and run the default `hello-pepr.ts` module without needing to understand\
  \ or pre-configure RBAC rules.\n\nIt’s important to note that `hello-pepr.ts` is intended\
  \ strictly as a demo to showcase Pepr features and workflow. It is not intended for production\
  \ use, and the documentation explicitly calls out that admin RBAC should not be used in production\
  \ environments.\n\nThat said, if a user skips the documentation and does not review the `npx\
  \ pepr build` options, they could deploy a module with broader privileges than necessary.\n\
  \nWe consider this low severity because Pepr is a framework: the module author is ultimately\
  \ responsible for selecting the appropriate RBAC scope for their module and environment as\
  \ each module has different RBAC needs and requirements. \n\nOur security focus is on ensuring\
  \ the Pepr controller and runtime components operate securely within Kubernetes, while still\
  \ allowing developers the flexibility to build modules with the access they require.\n\nIn\
  \ order to fix this we will warn the user in logs that the default `ClusterRole` is `cluster-admin`\
  \ and that it is not recommended for production.\n\n## How this can be exploited\n\nThis is\
  \ not an inherently exploitable CVE in the traditional sense. It is being flagged because\
  \ Pepr defaults to a cluster-admin RBAC configuration and does not explicitly force or enforce\
  \ least-privilege guidance for module authors.\n\nThe default behavior exists to make the\
  \ “getting started” experience smooth: new users can experiment with Pepr and create resources\
  \ dynamically without needing to pre-configure RBAC.\n\nRemediation: scope RBAC appropriately\
  \ before deploying to production. Running:\n\n```bash\nnpx pepr build --rbac-mode=scoped\n\
  ```\n\ngenerates the minimum RBAC required for the controller/informer to watch resources.\
  \ Any additional permissions must be added based on the specific Kubernetes resources and\
  \ CRUD operations performed by the module"
