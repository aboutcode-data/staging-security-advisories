  Duplicate Advisory: Data races on syncpool
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-vp6r-mrq9-8f4h. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send` for `Bucket2`. This allows sending non-Send types to other threads.

  This can lead to data races when non Send types like `Cell<T>` or `Rc<T>` are contained inside `Bucket2` and sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead to memory corruption (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue).

  The flaw was corrected in commit `15b2828` by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl of `Bucket2<T>`.
