summary: |
  Regular Expression Denial of Service in timespan
  Affected versions of `timespan` are vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service when parsing dates.

  The amplification for this vulnerability is significant, with 50,000 characters resulting in the event loop being blocked for around 10 seconds.


  ## Recommendation

  No direct patch is available for this vulnerability.

  Currently, the best available solution is to use a functionally equivalent alternative package.

  It is also sufficient to ensure that user input is not being passed into `timespan`, or that the maximum length of such user input is drastically reduced. Limiting the input length to 150 characters should be sufficient in most cases.
