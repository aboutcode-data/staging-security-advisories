  - CVE-2024-24821
summary: "Composer code execution and possible privilege escalation via compromised InstalledVersions.php\
  \ or installed.php\n### Impact\n\nSeveral files within the local working directory are included\
  \ during the invocation of Composer and in the context of the executing user.\n\nAs such,\
  \  under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may lead to local privilege escalation,\
  \ provide lateral user movement or malicious code execution when Composer is invoked within\
  \ a directory with tampered files.\n\nAll Composer CLI commands are affected, including composer.phar's\
  \ self-update.\n\nThe following are of high risk:\n\n- Composer being run with sudo.\n- Pipelines\
  \ which may execute Composer on untrusted projects.\n- Shared environments with developers\
  \ who run Composer individually on the same project.\n\n### Patches\n\n2.7.0, 2.2.23\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\n\n- It is advised that the patched versions are applied at the earliest convenience.\n\
  \nWhere not possible, the following should be addressed:\n- Remove all sudo composer privileges\
  \ for all users to mitigate root privilege escalation.  \n- Avoid running Composer within\
  \ an untrusted directory, or if needed, verify that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php`\
  \ and `vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code. \n\nA reset can also\
  \ be done on these files by the following:\n\n```sh\nrm vendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php\n\
  composer install --no-scripts --no-plugins\n```"
