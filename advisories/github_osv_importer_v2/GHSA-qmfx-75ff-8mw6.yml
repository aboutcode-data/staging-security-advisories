summary: "Listing of upload directory contents possible\nThere's an security issue in prosody-filer\
  \ versions **< 1.0.1** which leads to unwanted directory listings of download directories.\
  \ \n\nAn attacker is able to list previous uploads of a certain user by shortening the URL\
  \ and accessing a URL subdirectors other than `/upload/` (or the corresponding user defined\
  \ root dir)\n\nVersion 1.0.1 and later fix this problem and allow only direct file access\
  \ if the full path is known. Directory listings are blocked entirely."
