  DOS and excessive memory usage when passing untrusted user input to to dag import
  ### Impact
  go-ipfs nodes crash when trying to import certain malformed CAR files due to an issue in the go-car dependency. This impacts nodes running `ipfs dag import` on untrusted user inputs, for example, pinning services with a car ingest endpoint.
  This include the corresponding [HTTP RPC API `v0/dag/import`](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/#api-v0-dag-import) endpoint.

  An attacker controlling the car file passed in can also make the node allocate arbitrary sized buffers creating memory exhaustion attacks.

  ### Patches
  0.13.1, 0.14 and later.

  #### Forks
  For those running on forked versions of go-ipfs, simply updating the version of `github.com/ipld/go-car/v2` you are using to >= v2.4.0 should resolve the issue.

  #### Libraries consumers
  Any users of libraries within the go-ipfs ecosystem, even if not the go-ipfs package or binary itself, may be affected and should upgrade their dependency on go-car.

  You can check if your Go module has a dependency on go-car by running a command such as `go mod graph | grep go-car`  in your module root.

  Note: if you are using other libraries, some parts of go-car (`github.com/ipld/go-car/v2/index/...`) have not fully been fixed yet.  Please see [go-car's security advisory](https://github.com/ipld/go-car/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4h-8wgm-8xfg) for more information.  go-ipfs do not make use of this code.

  ### Workarounds
  The best way to work around this is to control exposure to the [HTTP RPC API endpoint for CAR imports](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/#api-v0-dag-import) to only work with trusted data.

  You can also validate that the car will not crash go-ipfs by running `car verify` on it first (`go install github.com/ipld/go-car/cmd/car@latest`).
