  - CVE-2023-39533
summary: |
  libp2p nodes vulnerable to attack using large RSA keys
  ### Impact
  A malicious peer can use large RSA keys to run a resource exhaustion attack & force a node to spend time doing signature verification of the large key. This vulnerability is present in the core/crypto module of go-libp2p and can occur during the Noise handshake and the libp2p x509 extension verification step.
  To prevent this attack, go-libp2p now restricts RSA keys to <= 8192 bits.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade their go-libp2p versions to >=v0.27.8, >= v0.28.2, or >=v0.29.1
  To protect your application, it's necessary to update to these patch releases **AND** to use the updated Go compiler (1.20.7 or 1.19.12, respectively)

  ### Workarounds
  There are no known workarounds

  ### References
  The Golang crypto/tls package also had this vulnerability ("verifying certificate chains containing large RSA keys is slow” https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460)
