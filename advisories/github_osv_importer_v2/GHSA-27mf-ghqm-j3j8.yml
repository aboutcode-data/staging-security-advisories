aliases:
  - CVE-2024-52303
summary: |
  aiohttp has a memory leak when middleware is enabled when requesting a resource with a non-allowed method
  ### Summary

  A memory leak can occur when a request produces a `MatchInfoError`. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each `MatchInfoError` producing a unique cache entry.

  ### Impact

  If the user is making use of any middlewares with `aiohttp.web` then it is advisable to upgrade immediately.

  An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests.
