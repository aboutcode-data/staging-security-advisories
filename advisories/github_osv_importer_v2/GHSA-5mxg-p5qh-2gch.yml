summary: |
  Jenkins Deployment Dashboard Plugin has Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  Jenkins Deployment Dashboard Plugin 1.0.10 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
