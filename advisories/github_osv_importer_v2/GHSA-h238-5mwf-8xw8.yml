aliases:
  - CVE-2025-64179
summary: |
  lakeFS affected by unauthenticated access to API usage metrics
  ### Impact

  Missing authentication in the `/api/v1/usage-report/summary` endpoint allows anyone to retrieve aggregate API usage counts. While no sensitive data is disclosed, the endpoint may reveal information about service activity or uptime.

  ### Patches
  Upgrade to >v1.70.1

  ### Workarounds

  Any **ONE** of these is sufficient to block this reporting:
  - Disable usage reporting by setting configuration option `usage_report.enabled` or environment variable `LAKEFS_USAGE_REPORT_ENABLED` to `false`.
  - Using load-balancer or application level firewall - blocking the request route /api/v1/usage-report/summary.
