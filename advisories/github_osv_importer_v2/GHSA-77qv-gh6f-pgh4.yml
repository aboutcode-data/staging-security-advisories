summary: |
  Command Injection in Limdu
  ### Impact
  The `trainBatch` function has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the Limdu library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.

  ### Patches
  Patched in version 0.9.5.

  ### Workarounds
  Do not use trainBatch with classifiers that rely on shell execution, such as SVM Perf, SVM Linear or Adaboost

  ### References
  No
