  xml-crypto's HMAC-SHA1 signatures can bypass validation via key confusion
  ### Impact
  An attacker can inject an HMAC-SHA1 signature that is valid using only knowledge of the RSA public key. This allows bypassing signature validation.

  ### Patches
  Version 2.0.0 has the fix.

  ### Workarounds
  The recommendation is to upgrade. In case that is not possible remove the 'http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#hmac-sha1' entry from SignedXml.SignatureAlgorithms.
