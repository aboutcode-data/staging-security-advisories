  Remote Code Execution in pi_video_recording
  All versions of `pi_video_recording` are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. Due to insufficient input validation the server executes arbitrary code through the /api/record/start endpoint.  After running the server, `curl -POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filename": " || touch /tmp/worked;"}' http://localhost:5000/api/record/start`creates a file in the /tmp/ directory


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
