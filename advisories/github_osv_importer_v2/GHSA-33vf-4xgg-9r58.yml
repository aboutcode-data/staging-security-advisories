summary: |
  HTTP Response Splitting (Early Hints) in Puma
  ### Impact
  If an application using Puma allows untrusted input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return character to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as [HTTP Response Splitting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting).

  While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

  This is related to [CVE-2020-5247](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v), which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses.

  ### Patches
  This has been fixed in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.

  ### Workarounds
  Users can not allow untrusted/user input in the Early Hints response header.
