summary: "n8n Merge Node has Arbitrary File Write leading to RCE\n## Impact\n\nA vulnerability\
  \ in the Merge node's SQL Query mode allowed authenticated users with permission to create\
  \ or modify workflows to write arbitrary files to the n8n server's filesystem potentially\
  \ leading to remote code execution.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in n8n version\
  \ 2.4.0, 1.118.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later to remediate the vulnerability.\n\
  \n## Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider\
  \ the following temporary mitigations:\n\n- Limit workflow creation and editing permissions\
  \ to fully trusted users only.\n- Disable or restrict use of the Merge node if not essential\
  \ for operations.\n- Review workflows for suspicious use of the Merge node's SQL Query mode.\n\
  \nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term\
  \ mitigation measures.\n\n## **Resources**\n\n- [n8n Documentation — Blocking nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) —\
  \ how to globally disable specific nodes\n\n\n---\nn8n has adopted CVSS 4.0 as primary score\
  \ for all security advisories. CVSS 3.1 vector strings are provided for backwards compatibility.\
