summary: "Sentry improperly authorizes muting of alert rules\n### Impact\nAn authenticated user\
  \ can mute alert rules from arbitrary organizations and projects given a known given rule\
  \ ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the\
  \ project. \n\nIn our review, we have identified no instances where alerts have been muted\
  \ by unauthorized parties. \n\n### Patches\nA patch was issued to ensure authorization checks\
  \ are properly scoped on requests to mute alert rules. Authenticated users who do not have\
  \ the necessary permissions are no longer able to mute alerts. \n\nSentry SaaS users do not\
  \ need to take any action. [Self-Hosted Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted)\
  \ users should upgrade to version **24.9.0** or higher.\n\n### Affected Versions\nThe rule\
  \ mute feature was generally available as of 23.6.0 but users with early access may have had\
  \ the feature as of 23.4.0. \n\n### Update\nAs of 2024-10-25 and after additional we've updated\
  \ the Severity scoring to reduce Privileged Required from Low to None and Integrity from High\
  \ to Low. Thanks again to @emanuelbeni for the correction on Privileges Required. \n\n###\
