aliases:
  - CVE-2020-29509
summary: |
  Authentication Bypass in github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2
  ### Impact
  Given a valid SAML Response, it may be possible for an attacker to mutate the XML document in such a way that gosaml2 will trust a different portion of the document than was signed.

  Depending on the implementation of the Service Provider this enables a variety of attacks, including users accessing accounts other than the one to which they authenticated in the Identity Provider, or full authentication bypass.

  ### Patches
  Service Providers utilizing gosaml2 should upgrade to v0.6.0 or greater.
