  sweetalert2 v8.19.1 and above contains hidden functionality
  `sweetalert2` versions 8.19.1 and up until 9.0.0 are vulnerable to hidden functionality that was introduced by the maintainer. The package outputs audio and/or video messages that do not pertain to the functionality of the package and is not included in versions below 8.19.1.

  ### Workaround
  Users who are unable to update to the fixed version (11.22.4) can use package versions 8.19.0 and below, as they do not contain the hidden functionality.
