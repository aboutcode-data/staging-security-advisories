summary: |
  RCE in Symfony
  Description
  -----------

  The `CachingHttpClient` class from the HttpClient Symfony component relies on the `HttpCache` class to handle requests. `HttpCache` uses internal headers like `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File` to control the restoration of cached responses. The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by `CachingHttpClient` and if an attacker can control the response for a request being made by the `CachingHttpClient`, remote code execution is possible.

  Resolution
  ----------

  HTTP headers designed for internal use in `HttpCache` are now stripped from remote responses before being passed to `HttpCache`.

  The patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d9910e0b33a2e0f993abff41c6fbc86951b66d78) for the 4.4 branch.

  Credits
  -------

  I would like to thank Matthias Pigulla (webfactory GmbH) for reporting and fixing the issue.
