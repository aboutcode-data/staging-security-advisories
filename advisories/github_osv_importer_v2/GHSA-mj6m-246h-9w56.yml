summary: "Improper regex in htaccess file\n### Impact\nthe default .htaccess file has some restrictions\
  \ in the access to PHP files to only allow specific PHP files to be executed in the root of\
  \ the application.\n\nThis logic isn't correct, as the regex in the second FilesMatch only\
  \ checks the filename, not the full path.\n\n### Patches\nPlease upgrade to 3.3.5 or 4.2.0\
  \ \n\n### Workarounds\nNo\n\n### References\n\n- Release post: https://www.mautic.org/blog/community/mautic-4-2-one-small-step-mautic\n\
