summary: "Pebble has Arbitrary Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability via `include` macro\n\
  ### Summary\n\nIf untrusted user input is used to dynamically create a `PebbleTemplate` with\
  \ the method `PebbleEngine#getLiteralTemplate`, then an attacker can include arbitrary local\
  \ files from the file system into the generated template, leaking potentially sensitive information\
  \ into the output of `PebbleTemplate#evaluate`. This is done via the `include` macro.\n\n\
  ### Details\n\nThe `include` macro calls `PebbleTempateImpl#resolveRelativePath` with the\
  \ `relativePath` argument passed within the template:\n\nExample template:\n```\n{% include\
  \ [relativePath] %}\n```\nWhen `resolveRelativePath` is called, the `relativePath`  is resolved\
  \ against the `PebbleTemplateImpl.name` variable.\n\n```java\n  /**\n   * This method resolves\
  \ the given relative path based on this template file path.\n   *\n   * @param relativePath\
  \ the path which should be resolved.\n   * @return the resolved path.\n   */\n  public String\
  \ resolveRelativePath(String relativePath) {\n    String resolved = this.engine.getLoader().resolveRelativePath(relativePath,\
  \ this.name);\n    if (resolved == null) {\n      return relativePath;\n    } else {\n   \
  \   return resolved;\n    }\n  }\n```\nhttps://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/blob/82ad7fcf9e9eaa45ee82ae3335a1409d19c10263/pebble/src/main/java/io/pebbletemplates/pebble/template/PebbleTemplateImpl.java#L380\n\
  \nUnfortunately, when the template is created from a string, as is the case when `PebbleEngine#getLiteralTemplate`\
  \ is used, the `PebbleTemplateImpl.name` variable is actually the entirety of the contents\
  \ of the template, not a filename as the logic expects. The net result is that the `relativePath`\
  \ is resolved against the system root directory. As a result, files accessible from the root\
  \ directory of the filesystem can be included into a template. \n\n### PoC\n\nThe following\
  \ test demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\n```java\nPebbleEngine e = new PebbleEngine.Builder().build();\n\
  \nString templateString = \"\"\"\n        {% include '/etc/passwd' %}\n        \"\"\";\nPebbleTemplate\
  \ template = e.getLiteralTemplate(templateString);\n\ntry (final Writer writer = new StringWriter())\
  \ {\n    template.evaluate(writer, new HashMap<>());\n    System.out.println(writer);\n}\n\
  ```\n\nAs an attacker, the following malicious template demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\n\
  ```\n{% include '/etc/passwd' %}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is an arbitrary  Local File Inclusion\
  \ (LFI) vulnerability. It can allow attackers to exfiltrate the contents of the local filesystem,\
  \ including sensitive files into `PebbleTemplate` output. This can also be used to access\
  \ the `/proc` filesystem which can give an attacker access to environment variables.\n\n###\
  \ Fix\n\nThere exists no published fix for this vulnerability. The best way to mitigate this\
  \ vulnerability is to disable the `include` macro in Pebble Templates.\n\nThe following can\
  \ safeguard your application from this vulnerability:\n\n```java\nnew PebbleEngine.Builder()\n\
  \            .registerExtensionCustomizer(new DisallowExtensionCustomizerBuilder()\n     \
  \               .disallowedTokenParserTags(List.of(\"include\"))\n                    .build())\n\
  \            .build();\n```\n\n### Report Timeline\n\nVulnerability was reported under the\
  \ Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Model Outbound Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:\
