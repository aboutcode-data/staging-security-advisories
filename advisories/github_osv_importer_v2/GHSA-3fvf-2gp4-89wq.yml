  Possibility for Denial of Service by overwriting PHP files with language exports
  ### Impact
  Laravel Translation Manager didn't check the locale name, which allowed directory traversal when exporting files. The content would be a PHP file returning an array of translations, but this could lead to unexpected results, like denial of service. Access to the Laravel Translation Manager is required, because a new locale would have to be added and published.

  ### Patches
  Version 0.6.2 fixes this issue.

  ### Workarounds
  Only allow trusted admins to publish/edit translations.
