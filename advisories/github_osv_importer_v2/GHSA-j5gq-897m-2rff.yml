  Race condition in the Okta Java SDK
  ### Description
  In the Okta Java SDK, race conditions may arise from concurrent requests using the ApiClient class. This could cause a status code or response header from one request’s response to influence another request’s response.

  You may be affected if you meet the following preconditions:
  - Using the Okta Java SDK between versions 11.0.0 and 20.0.0, and
  - Implementing a multithreaded application with the ApiClient class where the response status code is used in access control flows

  ### Resolution
