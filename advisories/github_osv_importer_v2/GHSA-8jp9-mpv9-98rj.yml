  amphp/http-client Header leakage on cross-domain redirects
  amphp/http-client has a security weakness that might leak sensitive request headers from the initial request to the redirected host on cross-domain redirects, which were not removed correctly. `Message::setHeaders` does not replace the entire set of headers, but only operates on the headers matching the given array keys.
