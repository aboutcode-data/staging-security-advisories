  - CVE-2025-62157
summary: |
  Argo Workflow may expose artifact repository credentials
  ### Summary
  An attacker who has permissions to read logs from pods in a namespace with Argo Workflow can read `workflow-controller` logs and get credentials to the artifact repository.

  ### Details
  An attacker, by reading the logs of the workflow controller pod, can access the artifact repository, and steal, delete or modify the data that resides there. The `workflow-controller` logs show the credentials in plaintext.

  ### Impact
  An attacker with access to pod logs in the `argo` namespace can extract plaintext credentials from the `workflow-controller` logs and gain access to the artifact repository. This can lead to:
  - Data exfiltration – theft of sensitive or proprietary artifacts
  - Data tampering – modification of workflows or artifacts
  - Data destruction – deletion of stored artifacts, leading to potential loss of critical data or pipeline failure
