  - CVE-2016-10549
summary: "Sails before 0.12.7 vulnerable to Broken CORS\nAffected versions of `sails` have an\
  \ issue with the CORS configuration where the value of the origin header is reflected as the\
  \ value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This may allow an attacker to make AJAX\
  \ requests to vulnerable hosts through cross-site scripting or a malicious HTML Document,\
  \ effectively bypassing the Same Origin Policy. \n\n## Mitigating Factors\n\nThis is only\
  \ an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented\
  \ out in the sails CORS config file. \n\nThe problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials`\
  \ setting is not provided, because at that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.12.7 or later.\n\nAs this vulnerability is primarily\
  \ a user error, the patch for the vulnerability will simply cause the application to write\
  \ an error message to the console when a vulnerable configuration is used in a production\
  \ environment.\n\nWriting a proper CORS configuration is still the responsibility of the user,\
  \ so it is necessary to check for the error message after installing the patch. Be sure you\
  \ are not using `allRoutes: true` with `origin:'*'`, and that you uncomment `origin` and set\
  \ it to a reasonable value. Ensure that if `origin` is set to `*` that you truly mean for\
  \ all other websites to be able to make cross-domain requests to your API.\n\nLikewise, ensure\
  \ `credentials` is uncommented out and set to the appropriate value. Make sure to explicitly\
  \ set which origins may request resources via CORS."
