  OpenClaw safeBins file-existence oracle information disclosure
  An information disclosure vulnerability in OpenClaw's `tools.exec.safeBins` approval flow allowed a file-existence oracle.

  When safe-bin validation examined candidate file paths, command allow/deny behavior could differ based on whether a path already existed on the host filesystem. An attacker could probe for file presence by comparing outcomes for existing vs non-existing filenames.

  ## Affected Packages / Versions
  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.17`
  - Latest published vulnerable version at triage time: `2026.2.17`
  - Planned patched version: `2026.2.19`

  ## Impact
  Attackers with access to this execution surface could infer whether specific files exist (for example secrets/config files), enabling filesystem enumeration and improving follow-on attack planning.

  ## Fix
  The safe-bin policy was changed to deterministic argv-only validation without host file-existence checks. File-oriented flags are blocked for safe-bin mode (for example `sort -o`, `jq -f`, `grep -f`), and trusted-path checks remain enforced.

  ## Fix Commit(s)
  - `bafdbb6f112409a65decd3d4e7350fbd637c7754`

  Thanks @nedlir for reporting.
