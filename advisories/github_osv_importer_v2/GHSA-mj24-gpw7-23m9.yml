  - CVE-2023-25822
summary: "Denial of service vulnerability on creating a Launch with too many recursively nested\
  \ elements in reportportal\n### Impact\nReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting\
  \ almost fully stops except for small launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path\
  \ field is exceeded the allowable \"ltree\" field type indexing limit (path length>=120 approximately,\
  \ recursive nesting of the nested steps). \n\nREINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx aren't\
  \ helped. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem was fixed in `service-api` module of version `5.10.0`\
  \ (product release [23.2](https://reportportal.io/docs/releases/Version23.2/)), where the\
  \ maximum number of nested elements were programmatically limited.\n\n### Workarounds\nAfter\
  \ deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx),\
  \ the database becomes stable and ReportPortal is working properly."
