summary: "HTTP Request Smuggling: Invalid Transfer-Encoding in Waitress\n### Impact\n\nWaitress\
  \ would parse the `Transfer-Encoding` header and only look for a single string value, if that\
  \ value was not `chunked` it would fall through and use the `Content-Length` header instead.\n\
  \nAccording to the HTTP standard `Transfer-Encoding` should be a comma separated list, with\
  \ the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with `chunked`.\n\
  \nRequests sent with:\n\n```\nTransfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\n```\n\nWould incorrectly get\
  \ ignored, and the request would use a `Content-Length` header instead to determine the body\
  \ size of the HTTP message.\n\nThis could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as\
  \ multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed\
  \ in Waitress 1.4.0. This brings a range of changes to harden Waitress against potential HTTP\
  \ request confusions, and may change the behaviour of Waitress behind non-conformist proxies.\
  \ \n\nWaitress will now return a 501 Not Implemented error if the `Transfer-Encoding` is not\
  \ `chunked` or contains multiple elements. Waitress does not support any transfer codings\
  \ such as `gzip` or `deflate`.\n\nThe Pylons Project recommends upgrading as soon as possible,\
  \ while validating that the changes in Waitress don&#39;t cause any changes in behavior.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nVarious reverse proxies may have protections against sending potentially\
  \ bad HTTP requests to the backend, and or hardening against potential issues like this. If\
  \ the reverse proxy doesn&#39;t use HTTP/1.1 for connecting to the backend issues are also\
  \ somewhat mitigated, as HTTP pipelining does not exist in HTTP/1.0 and Waitress will close\
  \ the connection after every single request (unless the Keep Alive header is explicitly sent...\
  \ so this is not a fool proof security method).\n\n### Issues/more security issues:\n\n* open\
  \ an issue at https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues (if not sensitive or security related)\n\
  * email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security\
  \ related)"
