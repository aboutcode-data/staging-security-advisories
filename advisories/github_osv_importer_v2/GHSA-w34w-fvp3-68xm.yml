summary: "Yeswiki Path Traversal vulnerability allows arbitrary read of files\n### Summary\n\
  The `squelette` parameter is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, enabling read access to\
  \ arbitrary files on the server. The payload `../../../../../../etc/passwd` was submitted\
  \ in the `squelette` parameter. The requested file was returned in the application's response.\n\
  \n### Details\nFile path traversal vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is used\
  \ within a filesystem operation in an unsafe manner. Typically, a user-supplied filename is\
  \ appended to a directory prefix in order to read or write the contents of a file. If vulnerable,\
  \ an attacker can supply path traversal sequences (using dot-dot-slash characters) to break\
  \ out of the intended directory and read or write files elsewhere on the filesystem.\n\n###\
  \ PoC\n1. Access the below URL to see the contents of `/etc/passwd`:\n   **URL with payload:**\
  \ `https://yeswiki.net/?UrkCEO/edit&theme=margot&squelette=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd&style=margot.css`\n\
  \   \n   Similarly, contents of `wakka.config.php` can be read (which contains database password)\
  \ using `..%2f..%2f..%2fwakka.config.php` as payload. Thus showing the severity of this issue.\
  \ \n\n### Impact\nThis is a very serious vulnerability, allowing an attacker to access sensitive\
  \ files containing configuration data, passwords, database records, log data, source code,\
  \ and program scripts and binaries. Thus, leading to complete loss of confidentiality."
