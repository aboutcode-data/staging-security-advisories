summary: "Flowise does not Prevent Bypass of Password Confirmation - Unverified Password Change\n\
  ### Summary\nBypass of Password Confirmation - Unverified Password Change (authenticated change\
  \ without current password)\n\nAn authenticated user is allowed to change their account password\
  \ without supplying the current password or any additional verification. The application does\
  \ not verify the actor’s authority to perform that credential change (no current-password\
  \ check, no authorization enforcement). An attacker who is merely authenticated (or who can\
  \ trick or coerce an authenticated session) can set a new password and gain control of the\
  \ account. (ATO - Account Takeover)\n\n### Details\nOccurence - code:\nhttps://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/main/packages/ui/src/views/account/index.jsx#L278\
  \ \n\nRemote and physical scenarios can be considered.\n\n### PoC\n**Repro steps:**\n1. As\
  \ logged in user https://cloud.flowiseai.com/account scroll down to 'Security' section\n2.\
  \ Change password to the new password\n3. Notice Unverified Password Change (authenticated\
  \ change without current password)\n\n**POC:** \nPassword changed, and notice \"Password updated\"\
  \ message.\n\n**Screenshot:**\n<img width=\"467\" height=\"526\" alt=\"secpw\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cc52978-9f37-42ca-a2b2-7285c4da9f1c\"\
  \ />\n\n\n### Impact\nFull account takeover (ATO) of affected accounts (loss of confidentiality\
  \ and integrity of account data).\nUser account recovery mechanisms (password reset flows\
  \ tied to email) can be bypassed or abused if combined with this issue and the second one\
  \ which I've reported (similar security issue with the email - part of credentials). (gain\
  \ persistence)"
