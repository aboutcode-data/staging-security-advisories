  - CVE-2023-40167
summary: "Jetty accepts \"+\" prefixed value in Content-Length\n### Impact\n\nJetty accepts\
  \ the '+' character proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field.  This is\
  \ more permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests\
  \ with 400 responses.  There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable that request\
  \ smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close\
  \ the connection after sending such a 400 response.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround\
  \ as there is no known exploit scenario.   \n\n### Original Report \n\n[RFC 9110 Secion 8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6)\
  \ defined the value of Content-Length header should be a string of 0-9 digits. However we\
  \ found that Jetty accepts \"+\" prefixed Content-Length, which could lead to potential HTTP\
  \ request smuggling.\n\nPayload:\n\n```\n POST / HTTP/1.1\n Host: a.com\n Content-Length:\
  \ +16\n Connection: close\n ​\n 0123456789abcdef\n```\n\nWhen sending this payload to Jetty,\
  \ it can successfully parse and identify the length.\n\nWhen sending this payload to NGINX,\
  \ Apache HTTPd or other HTTP servers/parsers, they will return 400 bad request.\n\nThis behavior\
  \ can lead to HTTP request smuggling and can be leveraged to bypass WAF or IDS."
