summary: |
  Local file disclosure in PHPMailer
  An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer&#39;s `msgHTML` method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to `/`, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.

  ### Impact
  Arbitrary local files can be attached to email messages.

  ### Patches
  Fixed in 5.2.22

  ### Workarounds
  Validate input before using user-supplied file paths.
