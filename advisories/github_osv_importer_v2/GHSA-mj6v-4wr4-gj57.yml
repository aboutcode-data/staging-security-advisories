summary: |
  Jenkins Start Windocks Containers Plugin is missing a permission check
  Jenkins Start Windocks Containers Plugin 1.4 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

  Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
