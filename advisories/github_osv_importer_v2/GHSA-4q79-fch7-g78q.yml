aliases:
  - CVE-2016-10606
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in grunt-webdriver-qunit\nAffected versions of `grunt-webdriver-qunit`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `grunt-webdriver-qunit`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available\
  \ for this vulnerability, and the package author has marked the package as deprecated.\n\n\
  The best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if\
  \ available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this\
  \ package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed\
  \ on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have\
  \ compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation\
  \ State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
