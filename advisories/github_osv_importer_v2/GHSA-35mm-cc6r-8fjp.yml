aliases:
  - CVE-2020-8264
summary: |
  Cross-site scripting in actionpack
  In actionpack gem >= 6.0.0, a possible XSS vulnerability exists when an application is running in development mode allowing an attacker to send or embed (in another page) a specially crafted URL which can allow the attacker to execute JavaScript in the context of the local application. This vulnerability is in the Actionable Exceptions middleware.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  Until such time as the patch can be applied, application developers should disable the Actionable Exceptions middleware in their development environment via a line such as this one in their config/environment/development.rb: `config.middleware.delete ActionDispatch::ActionableExceptions`
