  - CVE-2025-4754
summary: "ash_authentication_phoenix has Insufficient Session Expiration\n### Impact\n\nSession\
  \ tokens remain valid on the server after user logout, creating a security gap where:\n\n\
  - Compromised tokens (via XSS, network interception, or device theft) continue to work even\
  \ after the user logs out\n  - The sessions stored in the database still expire, limiting\
  \ the duration during which this could be exploited\n- Users cannot fully invalidate their\
  \ sessions when logging out from shared or potentially compromised devices \n  - by default,\
  \ changing one's password *does* invalidate all other sessions, so changing your password\
  \ as a security measure would have been effective\n- May cause compliance issues with security\
  \ frameworks requiring complete session \n### Patches\nUpgrade to version 2.10.0. After upgrading,\
  \ users must update their AuthController implementation to use the new `clear_session/2` function\
  \ with their OTP app name. You will be prompted to do so with a compile-time error.\n\nIf\
  \ you do not have the setting `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` set to `true` in\
  \ the `tokens` section, you will see a separate error:\n\n```\n** (Spark.Error.DslError) authentication\
  \ -> session_identifier:\nMust set `authentication.session_identifier` to either `:jti` or\
  \ `:unsafe`.\n\n...\n```\n\nIn order to revoke sessions on log out when not storing tokens\
  \ directly in the session, we must have some unique identifier with which to do so. You should\
  \ prefer to enable `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` if possible, instead of setting\
  \ this to `:jti`. Note that whatever you do here, if you did not previously have `require_token_presence_for_authentication?`\
  \ set to `true`, setting it to `true` *or* setting `authentication.session_identifier` to\
  \ `:jti` will log out all of your currently authenticated users.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can\
  \ manually revoke tokens in your `logout/2` handler in your auth controller."
