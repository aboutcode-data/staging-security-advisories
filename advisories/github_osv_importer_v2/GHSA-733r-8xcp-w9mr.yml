aliases:
  - CVE-2024-21641
summary: |
  Flarum's logout Route allows open redirects
  ### Impact
  The Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. Sample: `example.com/logout?return=https://google.com`. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation.

  Some ecosystem extensions modifying the logout route have already been affected. Sample: https://discuss.flarum.org/d/22229-premium-wordpress-integration/526

  ### Patches
  The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. All communities running Flarum should upgrade as soon as possible to v1.8.5 using:

  `composer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -a -W`

  You can then confirm you run the latest version using:

  `composer show flarum/core`

  ### Workarounds
  Some extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe. In any case we recommend updating to 1.8.5.
