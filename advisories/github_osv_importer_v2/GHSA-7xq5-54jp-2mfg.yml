summary: |
  Rasa Pro Missing Authentication For Voice Connector APIs
  ## Vulnerability
  A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa Pro where voice connectors in Rasa Pro do not properly implement authentication even when a token is configured in the `credentials.yml` file. This could allow an attacker to submit voice data to the Rasa Pro assistant from an unauthenticated source.

  This impacts the following connectors:

  - `audiocodes_stream`
  - `genesys`
  - `jambonz`

  As part of our investigation to resolve this issue, we have also performed a security review of our other voice channel connectors:

  - `browser_audio`: Does not support authentication. This is a development channel not intended for production use.
  - `twilio_media_streams`, `twilio_voice` and `jambonz`: Authentication is currently not supported by these channels, but our investigation has found a way for us to enable it for these voice channel connectors in a future Rasa Pro release.

  ## Fix
  The issue has been resolved for `audiocodes`, `audiocodes_stream`, and `genesys` connectors. Fixed versions of Rasa Pro have been released for `3.9.20`, `3.10.19`, `3.11.7` and `3.12.6`. Please update to a fixed release.

  If you are using one of the affected connectors, we strongly recommend upgrading to a fixed version. For connectors where authentication is not supported (e.g., Twilio), we suggest taking extra caution and considering other compensating controls if applicable.
