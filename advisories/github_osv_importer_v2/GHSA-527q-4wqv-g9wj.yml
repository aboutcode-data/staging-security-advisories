summary: |
  bagisto has Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Product Description
  ### Summary
  Bagisto v2.3.7 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) due to unsanitized user input being processed by the server-side templating engine when rendering product descriptions. This allows an attacker with product creation privileges to inject arbitrary template expressions that are evaluated by the backend — potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

  ### Details
  In Bagisto, product descriptions are rendered through Laravel’s Blade templating engine in various front-end and admin views. The product description field is not sanitized or escaped before being passed to the view, which means user-supplied data can break out of the expected string context and execute arbitrary template code.

  ### PoC
  Create a product and enter the payload to the description.

  Preview the page, observed that the template expressions were evaluated by the backend and displayed on the screen.

  ### Impact
  RCE potential: Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code or system commands.
  Data breach: Read sensitive environment variables (.env), API keys, or database credentials.
  Defacement / persistence: Inject malicious scripts or backdoors in dynamic templates.
  Privilege escalation: If attackers have limited roles (e.g., product manager), they can compromise the entire application or host.
