summary: "RISC Zero Underconstrained Vulnerability: Division\nTwo issues were found: For some\
  \ inputs to signed integer division, the circuit allowed two outputs, only one of which was\
  \ valid.  Additionally, the result of division by zero was underconstrained.\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ was identified using the Picus tool from Veridise. \n\nImpacted on-chain verifiers have\
  \ already been disabled via the estop mechanism outlined in the [Verifier Management Design](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/blob/release-2.0/contracts/version-management-design.md#base-verifier-implementations).\
  \ \n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe recommend all impacted users upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nRust\
  \ applications using the `risc0-zkvm` crate at versions < 2.2 should upgrade to version 2.2.0\
  \ or later. \n\nSmart contract applications using the official [RISC Zero Verifier Router](https://dev.risczero.com/api/blockchain-integration/contracts/verifier#verifier-router)\
  \ do not need to take any action: zkVM version 2.2 is active on all official routers, and\
  \ version 2.1 has been disabled.\n\nSmart contract applications not using the verifier router\
  \ should update their contracts to send verification calls to the 2.2 version of the verifier."
