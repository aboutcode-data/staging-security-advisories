summary: "Use after free passing `externref`s to Wasm in Wasmtime\n### Impact\n\nThere was a\
  \ use-after-free bug when passing `externref`s from the host to guest Wasm content.\n\nTo\
  \ trigger the bug, you have to explicitly pass multiple `externref`s from the host to a Wasm\
  \ instance at the same time, either by\n\n* passing multiple `externref`s as arguments from\
  \ host code to a Wasm function,\n* or returning multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value\
  \ return function defined in the host.\n \nIf you do not have host code that matches one of\
  \ these shapes, then you are not impacted.\n\nIf Wasmtime's [`VMExternRefActivationsTable`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/37c094faf53f1b356aab3c79d451395e4f7edb34/crates/runtime/src/externref.rs#L493)\
  \ became filled to capacity after passing the first `externref` in, then passing in the second\
  \ `externref` could trigger a garbage collection. However the first `externref` is not rooted\
  \ until we pass control to Wasm, and therefore could be reclaimed by the collector if nothing\
  \ else was holding a reference to it or otherwise keeping it alive. Then, when control was\
  \ passed to Wasm after the garbage collection, Wasm could use the first `externref`, which\
  \ at this point has already been freed.\n\nWe have reason to believe that the effective impact\
  \ of this bug is relatively small because usage of `externref` is currently quite rare.\n\n\
  ### Patches\n\nThe bug has been fixed, and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 0.30.0.\n\nAdditionally,\
  \ we have updated [our primary `externref` fuzz target](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/37c094faf53f1b356aab3c79d451395e4f7edb34/fuzz/fuzz_targets/table_ops.rs)\
  \ such that it better exercises these code paths and we can have greater confidence in their\
  \ correctness going forward.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade Wasmtime yet, you\
  \ can avoid the bug by disabling reference types support in Wasmtime by passing `false` to\
  \ [`wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.29.0/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_reference_types).\n\
