  - CVE-2025-6264
summary: "Velociraptor vulnerable to privilege escalation via UpdateConfig artifact\nVelociraptor\
  \ allows collection of VQL queries packaged into Artifacts from endpoints. These artifacts\
  \ can be used to do anything and usually run with elevated permissions.  To limit access to\
  \ some dangerous artifact, Velociraptor allows for those to require high permissions like\
  \ EXECVE to launch.\n\nThe Admin.Client.UpdateClientConfig is an artifact used to update the\
  \ client's configuration. This artifact did not enforce an additional required permission,\
  \ allowing users with COLLECT_CLIENT permissions (normally given by the \"Investigator\" role)\
  \ to collect it from endpoints and update the configuration. \n\nThis can lead to arbitrary\
  \ command execution and endpoint takeover.\n\nTo successfully exploit this vulnerability the\
  \ user must already have access to collect artifacts from the endpoint (i.e. have the COLLECT_CLIENT\
  \ given typically by the \"Investigator' role)."
