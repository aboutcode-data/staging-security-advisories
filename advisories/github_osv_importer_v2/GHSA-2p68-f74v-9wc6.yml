summary: "ActiveSupport potentially unintended unmarshalling of user-provided objects in MemCacheStore\
  \ and RedisCacheStore\nIn ActiveSupport, there is potentially unexpected behaviour in the\
  \ MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore where, when\nuntrusted user input is written to the cache\
  \ store using the `raw: true` parameter, re-reading the result\nfrom the cache can evaluate\
  \ the user input as a Marshalled object instead of plain text. Vulnerable code looks like:\n\
  \n```\ndata = cache.fetch(\"demo\", raw: true) { untrusted_string }\n```\nVersions Affected:\
  \  rails < 5.2.5, rails < 6.0.4\nNot affected:       Applications not using MemCacheStore\
  \ or RedisCacheStore. Applications that do not use the `raw` option when storing untrusted\
  \ user input.\nFixed Versions:     rails >= 5.2.4.3, rails >= 6.0.3.1\n  \nImpact\n------\n\
  Unmarshalling of untrusted user input can have impact up to and including RCE. At a minimum,\n\
  this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject untrusted Ruby objects into a web application.\n\
  In addition to upgrading to the latest versions of Rails, developers should ensure that whenever\n\
  they are calling `Rails.cache.fetch` they are using consistent values of the `raw` parameter\
  \ for both\nreading and writing, especially in the case of the RedisCacheStore which does\
  \ not, prior to these changes,\ndetect if data was serialized using the raw option upon deserialization.\n\
  \nWorkarounds\n-----------\nIt is recommended that application developers apply the suggested\
  \ patch or upgrade to the latest release as\nsoon as possible. If this is not possible, we\
  \ recommend ensuring that all user-provided strings cached using\nthe `raw` argument should\
  \ be double-checked to ensure that they conform to the expected format."
