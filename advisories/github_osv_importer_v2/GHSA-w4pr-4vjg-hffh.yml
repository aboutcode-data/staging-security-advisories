  - CVE-2022-39254
summary: |
  When matrix-nio receives forwarded room keys, the receiver doesn't check if it requested the key from the forwarder
  When matrix-nio before 0.20 requests a room key from our devices, it correctly accepts key forwards only if they are a response to a previous request. However, it doesn't check that the device that responded matches the device the key was requested from.

  This allows a malicious homeserver to insert room keys of questionable validity into the key store in some situations, potentially assisting in an impersonation attack.
