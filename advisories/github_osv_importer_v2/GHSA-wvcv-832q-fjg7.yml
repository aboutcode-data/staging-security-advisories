  - CVE-2020-26263
summary: "RSA weakness in tslite-ng\n### Impact\nThe code that performs decryption and padding\
  \ check in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant.\nIn particular, code in current (as\
  \ of 0.8.0-alpha38) master\nhttps://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlslite-ng/blob/0812ed60860fa61a6573b2c0e18771414958f46d/tlslite/utils/rsakey.py#L407-L441\n\
  and code in 0.7.5 branch\nhttps://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlslite-ng/blob/acdde3161124d6ae37c506b3476aea9996d12e97/tlslite/utils/rsakey.py#L394-L425\n\
  has multiple ways in which it leaks information (for one, it aborts as soon as the plaintext\
  \ doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02) about the decrypted ciphertext (both the bit length of the\
  \ decrypted message as well as where the first unexpected byte lays).\n\nAll TLS servers that\
  \ enable RSA key exchange as well as applications that use the RSA decryption API directly\
  \ are vulnerable.\n\nAll previous versions of tlslite-ng are vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\
  The patches to fix it are proposed in \nhttps://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlslite-ng/pull/438\n\
  https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlslite-ng/pull/439\n\nNote: the patches depend on Python processing\
  \ the individual bytes in side-channel free manner, this is known to not be the case: https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/\n\
  As such, users that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different TLS implementations,\
  \ as stated in the [security policy](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlslite-ng/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ of tlslite-ng.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no way to workaround this issue.\n\n### References\n\

  \ For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please open\
