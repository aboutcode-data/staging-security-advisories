summary: |
  Jenkins Artifactory Plugin missing permission check
  Jenkins Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

  This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.
