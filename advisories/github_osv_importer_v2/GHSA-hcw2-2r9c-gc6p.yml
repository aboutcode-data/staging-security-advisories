summary: |
  CasaOS Username Enumeration - Bypass of CVE-2024-24766
  ### Summary

  The Casa OS Login page has disclosed the username enumeration vulnerability in the login page which was patched in `CasaOS  v0.4.7`.

  ### Details

  It is observed that the attacker can enumerate the CasaOS username using the application response. If the username is incorrect the application gives the error "**User does not exist**" with success code "**10006**", If the password is incorrect the application gives the error "**User does not exist or password is invalid**" with success code "**10013**".

  ### PoC

  1. If the Username is invalid application gives "User does not exist" with success code "**10006**".

  2. If the Password is invalid application gives  "**User does not exist or password is invalid**" with success code "**10013**".

  ### Impact

  Using this error attacker can enumerate the username of CasaOS.

  ### The logic behind the issue

  The logic behind the issue
  If the username is incorrect, then throw an error  "**User does not exist**" with success code "**10006**", else throw an error "**User does not exist or password is invalid**" with success code "**10013**".

  This condition can be vice versa like:

  If the password is incorrect, then throw an error "**User does not exist or password is invalid**" with success code "**10013**", else throw an error  "**User does not exist**" with success code "**10006**".

  ### Mitigation
  Since this is the condition we have to implement a single error which can be "**Username/Password is Incorrect!!!**" with single success code.
