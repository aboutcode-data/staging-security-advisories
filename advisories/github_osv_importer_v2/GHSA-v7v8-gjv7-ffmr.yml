aliases:
  - CVE-2023-26140
summary: |
  @excalidraw/excalidraw Cross-site Scripting vulnerability
  ### Impact

  XSS vulnerability due to improperly sanitizing URLs of links that can be attached on canvas elements. This affects users of the npm package `@excalidraw/excalidraw` provided it was deployed in environments where untrusted user input in drawings that are then shared with third parties is a concern. If you only hosted the editor in trusted environments, or sharing didn't take place, the impact is minimized.

  ### Patches

  Patch is available on version 0.15.3 and up (stable), or latest `@excalidraw/excalidraw@next` (unstable releases).

  ### Workarounds

  No workaround without upgrading unless deployed in environments without untrusted user input.
