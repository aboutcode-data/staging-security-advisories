summary: |
  Youki: If /proc and /sys in the rootfs are symbolic links, they can potentially be exploited to gain access to the host root filesystem.
  ### Summary
  If `/proc` and `/sys` in the rootfs are symbolic links, they can potentially be exploited to gain access to the host root filesystem.

  ### Details

  For security reasons, container creation should be prohibited if `/proc` or `/sys` in the rootfs is a symbolic link.
  I verified this behavior with `youki`.
  When `/proc` or `/sys` is a symbolic link, `runc` fails to create the container, whereas `youki` successfully creates it.

  This is the fix related to this issue in `runc`.
