summary: "soroban-fixed-point-math has Incorrect Rounding and Overflow Handling in Signed Fixed-Point\
  \ Math with Negatives\n### Impact\n\n#### Incorrect rounding direction for signed mul and\
  \ div operations\n\nThe `mulDiv(x, y, z)` function incorrectly handled cases where both the\
  \ intermediate product $x * y$ and the divisor $z$ were negative. The logic assumed that if\
  \ the intermediate product was negative, the final result must also be negative, neglecting\
  \ the sign of $z$.\n\nThis resulted in rounding being applied in the wrong direction for cases\
  \ where both $x * y$ and $z$ were negative. The functions most at risk are `fixed_div_floor`\
  \ and `fixed_div_ceil`, as they often use non-constant numbers as the divisor $z$ in `mulDiv`.\
  \ \n\nThis error is present in all signed `FixedPoint` and `SorobanFixedPoint` implementations,\
  \ including `i64`, `i128`, and `I256`.\n\n#### Negative Overflow in `i64`\n\nThe `mulDiv(x,\
  \ y, z)` function for `i64` used the `i128` type to handle \"phantom overflows\". These are\
  \ overflows that occur intermediately during a calculation, like when computing the intermediate\
  \ product $x * y$. When the final result of `mulDiv` was computed in `i128`, it was scaled\
  \ back down to `i64` before returning. While the code verified that the result did not exceed\
  \ `i64::MAX`, it did not check against `i64::MIN`.\n\nThis caused negative results smaller\
  \ than `i64:MIN` to wrap around to a large positive number instead of being caught as an overflow.\n\
  \nThis error only exists for the `FixedPoint` implementation of `i64`. \n\n### Patches\n\n\
  * v1.3.0 users should upgrade to patch v1.3.1\n* v1.4.0 users should upgrade to patch v1.4.1\n\
  \nAll versions `>=v1.4.1` contain the patch. \n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds.\
  \ Upgrade to the patched version.\n\n### Credits\n\nsoroban-fixed-point-math would like to\
  \ thank the team at [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) for discovering and reporting the\
  \ issue."
