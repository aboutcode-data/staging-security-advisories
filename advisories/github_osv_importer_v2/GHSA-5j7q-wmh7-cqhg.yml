summary: |
  TYPO3 CMS Allows Broken Access Control in Edit Document Controller
  ### Problem
  By exploiting the `defVals` parameter, attackers could bypass field‑level access checks during record creation in the TYPO3 backend. This gave them the ability to insert arbitrary data into prohibited exclude fields of a database table for which the user already has write permission for a reduced set of fields.

  ### Solution
  Update to TYPO3 versions 10.4.55 ELTS, 11.5.49 ELTS, 12.4.41 LTS, 13.4.23 LTS, 14.0.2 that fix the problem described.

  ### Credits
  Thanks to Daniel Windloff for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke for fixing it.
