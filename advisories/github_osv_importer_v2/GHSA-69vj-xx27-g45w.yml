  - CVE-2020-36216
summary: |
  Data race in eventio
  Input<R> implements Send without requiring R: Send.

  Affected versions of this crate allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to undefined behavior such as data race and memory corruption.

  The flaw was corrected in version 0.5.1 by adding R: Send bound to the Send impl of Input<R>.
