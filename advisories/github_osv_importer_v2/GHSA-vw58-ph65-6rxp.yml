summary: |
  Directus inserts access token from query string into logs
  ### Summary
  Access token from query string is not redacted and is potentially exposed in system logs which may be persisted.

  ### Details
  The access token in `req.query` is not redacted when the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. If these logs are not properly sanitized or protected, an attacker with access to it can potentially gain administrative control, leading to unauthorized data access and manipulation.

  ### PoC
  1. Set `LOG_LEVEL="raw"` in the environment.
  2. Send a request with the `access_token` in the query string.
  3. Notice that the `access_token` in `req.query` is not redacted.

  ### Impact
  It impacts systems where the `LOG_STYLE` is set to `raw`. The `access_token` in the query could potentially be a long-lived static token. Users with impacted systems should rotate their static tokens if they were provided using query string.
