summary: "Formwork Improperly Managed Privileges in User creation\n### Summary\n\nThe application\
  \ fails to properly enforce role-based authorization during account creation. Although the\
  \ system validates that the specified role exists, it does not verify whether the current\
  \ user has sufficient privileges to assign highly privileged roles such as admin. As a result,\
  \ an authenticated user with the editor role can create a new account with administrative\
  \ privileges, leading to full administrative access and complete compromise of the CMS.\n\n\
  ### Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to:\n- Gain full administrative control\
  \ over the CMS.\n- Access all site data and user information.  \n- Modify system configuration\
  \ and security settings.\n- Create, modify, or delete any user account, including legitimate\
  \ administrators.\n\n### Patches\n\n[Formwork 2.3.4](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/releases/tag/2.3.4)\
  \  properly assigns roles on user creation."
