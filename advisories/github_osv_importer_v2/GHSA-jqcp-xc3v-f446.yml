summary: "fast-float2 has a segmentation fault due to lack of bound check\nIn this case, the\
  \ \"fast_float2::common::AsciiStr::first\" method within the \"AsciiStr\" struct \nuses the\
  \ unsafe keyword to reading from memory without performing bounds checking. \nSpecifically,\
  \ it directly dereferences a pointer offset by \"self.ptr\".\nBecause of the above reason,\
  \ the method accesses invalid memory address when it takes an empty string as its input.\n\
  This approach violates Rust’s memory safety guarantees, as it can lead to invalid memory access\
  \ if empty buffer is provided."
