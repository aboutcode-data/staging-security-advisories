summary: |
  secrets-store-sync-controller discloses service account tokens in logs
  Hello Kubernetes Community,

  A security issue was discovered in secrets-store-sync-controller where an actor with access to the controller logs could observe service account tokens.  These tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers to access secrets stored in cloud vault solutions.  Tokens are only logged when there is a specific error marshaling the `parameters` sent to the providers.

  ### Am I vulnerable?

  To check if tokens are being logged, examine the manager container log:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l 'app.kubernetes.io/part-of=secrets-store-sync-controller' -c manager -f | grep --line-buffered "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens"
  ```

  ### Affected Versions

  - secrets-store-sync-controller < v0.0.2

  ### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

  Upgrade to secrets-store-sync-controller v0.0.2+

  ### Fixed Versions

  - secrets-store-sync-controller >= v0.0.2


  ### Detection

  Examine cloud provider logs for unexpected token exchanges, as well as unexpected access to cloud vault secrets.

  If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact [security@kubernetes.io](https://groups.google.com/)

  This vulnerability was reported by Reem Rotenberg and [Kas Dekel](https://github.com/privmickas) from Microsoft.
