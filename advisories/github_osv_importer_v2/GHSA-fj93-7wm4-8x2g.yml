  Cross-Site Scripting in jquery-mobile
  All version of `jquery-mobile` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The package checks for content in `location.hash` and if a URL is found it does an XmlHttpRequest (XHR) to the URL and renders the response with `innerHTML`. It fails to validate the `Content-Type` of the response, allowing attackers to include malicious payloads as part of query parameters that are reflected back to the user. A response such as `{"q":"<iframe/src='javascript:alert(1)'></iframe>","results":[]}` would be parsed as HTML and the JavaScript payload executed.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
