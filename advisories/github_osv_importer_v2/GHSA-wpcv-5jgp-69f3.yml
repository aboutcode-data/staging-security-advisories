summary: "Genie Path Traversal vulnerability via File Uploads\n### Overview\nPath Traversal\
  \ Vulnerability via  File Uploads in Genie \n\n### Impact\nAny Genie OSS users running their\
  \ own instance and relying on the filesystem to store file attachments submitted to the Genie\
  \ application may be impacted. Using this technique, it is possible to write a file with any\
  \ user-specified filename and file contents to any location on the file system that the Java\
  \ process has write access - potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nGenie\
  \ users who do not store these attachments locally on the underlying file system are not vulnerable\
  \ to this issue. \n\n### Description\nGenie's API accepts a multipart/form-data file upload\
  \ which can be saved to a location on disk. However, it takes a user-supplied filename as\
  \ part of the request and uses this as the filename when writing the file to disk. Since this\
  \ filename is user-controlled, it is possible for a malicious actor to manipulate the filename\
  \ in order to break out of the default attachment storage path and perform path traversal.\
  \ \n\nUsing this technique it is possible to write a file with any user specified name and\
  \ file contents to any location on the file system that the Java process has write access\
  \ to.\n\n### Patches\nThis path traversal issue is fixed in Genie OSS v4.3.18. This issue\
  \ was fixed in https://github.com/Netflix/genie/pull/1216 and  https://github.com/Netflix/genie/pull/1217\
  \ and a [new release](https://github.com/Netflix/genie/releases/tag/v4.3.18) with the fix\
  \ was created. Please, upgrade your Genie OSS instances to the new version."
