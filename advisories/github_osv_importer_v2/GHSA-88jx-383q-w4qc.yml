summary: "Cosign malicious attachments can cause system-wide denial of service\n### Summary\n\
  A remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine\
  \ running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory\
  \ available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the\
  \ availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration\
  \ of the machine denial.\n\n### Details\nThe root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads\
  \ the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the\
  \ attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into\
  \ memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine\
  \ will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a `SIGKILL` after a few seconds of system-wide\
  \ denial.\n\nThe root cause is that Cosign reads the contents of the attachments entirely\
  \ into memory on line 238 below:\n\nhttps://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/9bc3ee309bf35d2f6e17f5d23f231a3d8bf580bc/pkg/oci/remote/remote.go#L228-L239\n\
  \n...and prior to that, neither Cosign nor go-containerregistry checks the size of the attachment\
  \ and enforces a max cap. In the case of a remote layer of `f *attached`, go-containerregistry\
  \ will invoke this API:\n\nhttps://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/a0658aa1d0cc7a7f1bcc4a3af9155335b6943f40/pkg/v1/remote/layer.go#L36-L40\n\
  ```golang\nfunc (rl *remoteLayer) Compressed() (io.ReadCloser, error) {\n\t// We don't want\
  \ to log binary layers -- this can break terminals.\n\tctx := redact.NewContext(rl.ctx, \"\
  omitting binary blobs from logs\")\n\treturn rl.fetcher.fetchBlob(ctx, verify.SizeUnknown,\
  \ rl.digest)\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the second argument to `rl.fetcher.fetchBlob` is `verify.SizeUnknown`\
  \ which results in not using the `io.LimitReader` in `verify.ReadCloser`:\nhttps://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/a0658aa1d0cc7a7f1bcc4a3af9155335b6943f40/internal/verify/verify.go#L82-L100\n\
  ```golang\nfunc ReadCloser(r io.ReadCloser, size int64, h v1.Hash) (io.ReadCloser, error)\
  \ {\n\tw, err := v1.Hasher(h.Algorithm)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\tr2\
  \ := io.TeeReader(r, w) // pass all writes to the hasher.\n\tif size != SizeUnknown {\n\t\t\
  r2 = io.LimitReader(r2, size) // if we know the size, limit to that size.\n\t}\n\treturn &and.ReadCloser{\n\
  \t\tReader: &verifyReader{\n\t\t\tinner:    r2,\n\t\t\thasher:   w,\n\t\t\texpected: h,\n\t\
  \t\twantSize: size,\n\t\t},\n\t\tCloseFunc: r.Close,\n\t}, nil\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis\
  \ issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user:\
  \ If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include\
  \ a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer. \n\n### Remediation\nUpdate to the latest\
  \ version of Cosign, which limits the number of attachments. An environment variable can override\
  \ this value."
