  ZendFramework local file inclusion vector in `Zend_View::setScriptPath()` and `render()`
  Zend_View is a component that utilizes PHP as a templating language. To utilize it, you specify "script paths" that contain view scripts, and then `render()` view scripts by specifying subdirectories within those script paths; the output is then returned as a string value which may be cached or directly output.

  `Zend_View::setScriptPath()` in versions up to and including 1.7.4 include a potential Local File Inclusion vulnerability. If untrusted input is used to specify the script path and/or view script itself, a malicious attacker could potentially specify a system directory and thus render a system file.

  As an example, if the user-supplied string `/etc/passwd` or a relative path that resolved to that file, was supplied to `Zend_View::render()`, that file would be rendered.
