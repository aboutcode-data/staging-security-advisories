  - CVE-2016-10641
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in node-bsdiff-android\nAffected versions of `node-bsdiff-android`\
  \ insecurely download resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged\
  \ network position, they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity\
  \ of impact for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of\
  \ the package itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all the way\
  \ up to and including remote code execution.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently\
  \ available for this vulnerability, and the package has not seen an update since 2014.\n\n\
  The best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if\
  \ available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this\
  \ package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed\
  \ on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have\
  \ compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation\
  \ State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
