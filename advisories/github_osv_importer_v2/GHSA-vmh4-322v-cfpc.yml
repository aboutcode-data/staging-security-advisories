  Cross-Site Scripting in cmmn-js-properties-panel
  Versions of `cmmn-js-properties-panel` prior to 0.8.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to sanitize input in specially configured diagrams, which may allow attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the embedding website.
