aliases:
  - CVE-2026-25631
summary: |
  n8n's domain allowlist bypass enables credential exfiltration
  ## Impact

  A vulnerability in the HTTP Request node's credential domain validation allowed an authenticated attacker to send requests with credentials to unintended domains, potentially leading to credential exfiltration.

  This only might affect user who have credentials that use wildcard domain patterns (e.g., `*.example.com`) in the "Allowed domains" setting.

  ## Patches

  This issue is fixed in version 1.121.0 and later. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

  ## Workarounds
  Until projects can upgrade:

  - Replace wildcard domain patterns with explicit domain listings in HTTP Request credentials
  - Review and restrict workflow creation/modification permissions to trusted users only
  - Audit existing workflows using HTTP Request nodes with domain-restricted credentials
