  Vendure Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability impacting all API requests
  ### Impact
  Vendure is an e-commerce GraphQL framework with a number of APIs and different levels of
  authorization. By default the Cookie settings are insecure, having the SameSite setting as false
  which results in not having one (originates from the cookie-session npm package’s default
  settings).

  ### Patches
  In progress

  ### Workarounds
  Manually set the `authOptions.cookieOptions.sameSite` configuration option to `'strict'`, `'lax'` or `true`.
