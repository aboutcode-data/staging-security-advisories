summary: |
  malcontent: Nested archive extraction failure can drop content from scan inputs
  Previously, malcontent would remove nested archives which failed to extract which could potentially leave malicious content. A better approach is to preserve these archives so that malcontent can attempt a best-effort scan of the archive bytes.

  **Fix**:  https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/pull/1383

  **Acknowledgements**

  malcontent thanks Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting this issue.
