aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41246
summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability and mM
  Worksoft Execution Manager Plugin 10.0.3.503 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
