  Enabling Authentication does not close all logged in socket connections immediately
  ### Summary
  This is basically [GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q3) but instead of changing passwords, when enabling authentication.

  ### PoC
  - Open Uptime Kuma with authentication disabled
  - Enable authentication using another window
  - Access the platform using the previously logged-in window
  - Note that access (read-write) remains despite the enabled authentication
  - Expected behaviour:
    - After enabling authentication, all previously connected sessions should be invalidated, requiring users to log in.
  - Actual behaviour:
    - The system retains sessions and never logs out users unless explicitly done by clicking logout or refreshing the page.

  ### Impact
  See [GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g) and [GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/GHSA-88j4-pcx8-q4q3)

  TBH this is quite a niche edge case, so I don't know if this even warrants a security report.
