summary: |
  Credentials stored in plain text by Jenkins Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin
  Jenkins Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin 4.1.5 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.agiletestware.bumblebee.BumblebeeGlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.
