  - CVE-2023-22579
summary: "Unsafe fall-through in getWhereConditions\n### Impact\n\nProviding an invalid value\
  \ to the `where` option of a query caused Sequelize to ignore that option instead of throwing\
  \ an error. \n\nA finder call like the following did not throw an error:\n\n```ts\nUser.findAll({\n\
  \  where: new Date(),\n});\n```\n\nAs this option is typically used with plain javascript\
  \ objects, be aware that this only happens at the top level of this option.\n\n### Patches\n\
  \nThis issue has been patched in [`sequelize@6.28.1`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15699)\
  \ & [`@sequelize/core@7.0.0.alpha-20`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15375)\n\
  \n### References\n\nA discussion thread about this issue is open at https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/discussions/15698\n\
