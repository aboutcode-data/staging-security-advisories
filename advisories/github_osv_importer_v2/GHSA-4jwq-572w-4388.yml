summary: |
  Memory over-allocation in evm crate
  ### Impact
  Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the crate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack.

  ### Patches
  The flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`. Users should upgrade to `==0.21.1, ==0.23.1, ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`.

  ### Workarounds
  None. Please upgrade your `evm` crate version

  ### References
  Fix commit: https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/commit/19ade858c430ab13eb562764a870ac9f8506f8dd
