summary: |
  Improper Access Control in Shopware
  Shopware 6 is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue and supported by a worldwide community and more than 1.500 community extensions. Permissions set to sales channel context by admin-api are still useable within normal user session. We recommend updating to the current version 6.4.10.1. You can get the update to 6.4.10.1 regularly via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.
