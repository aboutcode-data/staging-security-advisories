summary: "Mautic allows Remote Code Execution and File Deletion in Asset Uploads\n### Summary\n\
  This advisory addresses two critical security vulnerabilities present in Mautic versions before\
  \ 5.2.3.  These vulnerabilities could be exploited by authenticated users.\n\n* **Remote Code\
  \ Execution (RCE) via Asset Upload:**  A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been identified\
  \ in the asset upload functionality. Insufficient enforcement of allowed file extensions allows\
  \ an attacker to bypass restrictions and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.\n\n\
  * **Path Traversal File Deletion:** A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation\
  \ process.  Due to improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate\
  \ the file deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system. \n  \n### Mitigation\n\
  Please update to 5.2.3 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n### References\nhttps://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection\n\
