  - CVE-2023-37964
summary: |
  Jenkins ElasticBox CI Plugin vulnerable to cross-site request forgery
  Jenkins ElasticBox CI Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
