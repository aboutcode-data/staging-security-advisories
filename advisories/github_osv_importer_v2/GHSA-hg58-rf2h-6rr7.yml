summary: "CometBFT is unstability during blocksync when syncing from malicious peer\n**Name**:\
  \ ASA-2024-008: Instability during blocksync when syncing from malicious peer\n**Component**:\
  \ CometBFT\n**Criticality**: Medium ([ACMv1](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md):\
  \ I:Moderate; L: Possible)\n**Affected versions**: < v0.38.7 \n\n# Summary\n\nAn issue was\
  \ identified for nodes syncing on an existing network during blocksync in which a malicious\
  \ peer could cause the syncing peer to panic, enter into a catastrophic invalid syncing state\
  \ or get stuck in blocksync mode, never switching to consensus. It is recommended for all\
  \ clients to adopt this patch so that blocksync functions as expected and is tolerant of malicious\
  \ peers presenting invalid data in this situation. Nodes that are vulnerable to this state\
  \ may experience a Denial of Service condition in which syncing will not work as expected\
  \ when joining a network as a client.\n\n# Recognition\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos\
  \ Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on 5/01/24 by unknown_feature. If you believe you have found\
  \ a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the program by reporting a\
  \ bug, please see https://hackerone.com/cosmos.\n\nIf you have questions about Interchain\
  \ security efforts, please reach out to our official communication channel at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io).\n\
