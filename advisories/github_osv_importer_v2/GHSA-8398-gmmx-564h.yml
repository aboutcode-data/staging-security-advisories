summary: "n8n has a Python sandbox escape\n## Impact\n\nA vulnerability in the Python Code node\
  \ allows authenticated users to break out of the Python sandbox environment and execute code\
  \ outside the intended security boundary. \n\nOnly authenticated users are able to execute\
  \ code through Task Runners.\n\nThis issue affected any deployment in which the following\
  \ conditions were met:\n\n- Task Runners were enabled using `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` (default:\
  \ false)\n- Python was enabled `N8N_PYTHON_ENABLED=true`\n- Code Node was enabled (default:\
  \ true)\n\nIn case the `N8N_RUNNERS_MODE` is set to `external` (default: `internal`) the sandbox\
  \ escape is limited to the sidecar container with lower risk for lateral movement. In that\
  \ case a lower high severity is more appropriate.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis vulnerability is fixed\
  \ in version 2.4.8 and later. \n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate upgrade cannot be applied,\
  \ the following hardening steps are recommended:\n\n- Disable the Code Node by adding `n8n-nodes-base.code` to\
  \ the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable\n- Prefer external mode for isolation: run Task\
  \ Runners in external mode so that untrusted task code executes in a separate sidecar container\
  \ rather than within the main n8n process. This configuration significantly reduces the risk\
  \ of in-process memory disclosure caused by unsafe buffer [allocations.In](http://allocations.in/)\
  \ external mode, a launcher manages Task Runner processes in a dedicated sidecar environment,\
  \ separate from the primary n8n instance. See the [[n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/)](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/) for\
  \ configuration details and required environment variables.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [n8n Documentation\
  \ — Task Runners](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/) — external mode,\
  \ setup guide, and environment configuration details\n- [n8n Documentation — Blocking nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) —\
  \ how to globally disable specific nodes\n\n---\nn8n has adopted CVSS 4.0 as primary score\
  \ for all security advisories. CVSS 3.1 vector strings are provided for backward compatibility.\n\
