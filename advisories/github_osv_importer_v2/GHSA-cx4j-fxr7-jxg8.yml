aliases:
  - CVE-2021-25902
summary: |
  Double free in glsl-layout
  Affected versions of this crate did not guard against panic within the user-provided function f (2nd parameter of fn map_array), and thus panic within f causes double drop of a single object.

  The flaw was corrected in the 0.4.0 release by wrapping the object vulnerable to a double drop within ManuallyDrop<T>.
