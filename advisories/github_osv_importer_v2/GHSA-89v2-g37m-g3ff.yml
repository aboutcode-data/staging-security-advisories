summary: "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature in aws-encryption-sdk-cli\n### Impact\n\
  \nThis advisory addresses several LOW severity issues with streaming signed messages and restricting\
  \ processing of certain types of invalid messages. \n\nThis ESDK supports a streaming mode\
  \ where callers may stream the plaintext of signed messages before the ECDSA signature is\
  \ validated. In addition to these signatures, the ESDK uses AES-GCM encryption and all plaintext\
  \ is verified before being released to a caller. There is no impact on the integrity of the\
  \ ciphertext or decrypted plaintext, however some callers may rely on the the ECDSA signature\
  \ for non-repudiation. Without validating the ECDSA signature, an actor with trusted KMS permissions\
  \ to decrypt a message may also be able to encrypt messages. This update introduces a new\
  \ API for callers who wish to stream only unsigned messages. \n\nFor customers who process\
  \ ESDK messages from untrusted sources, this update also introduces a new configuration to\
  \ limit the number of Encrypted Data Keys (EDKs) that the ESDK will attempt to process per\
  \ message. This configuration provides customers with a way to limit the number of AWS KMS\
  \ Decrypt API calls that the ESDK will make per message. This setting will reject messages\
  \ with more EDKs than the configured limit.\n\nFinally, this update adds early rejection of\
  \ invalid messages with certain invalid combinations of algorithm suite and header data.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nFixed in versions 1.9 and 2.2. We recommend that all users upgrade to address\
  \ these issues.\n\nCustomers leveraging the ESDK’s streaming features have several options\
  \ to protect signature validation. One is to ensure that client code reads to the end of the\
  \ stream before using released plaintext. With this release, using the new API for streaming\
  \ and falling back to the non-streaming decrypt API for signed messages prevents using any\
  \ plaintext from signed data before the signature is validated. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/about-versions.html#version2.2.x\n\
  \nUsers processing ESDK messages from untrusted sources should use the new maximum encrypted\
  \ data keys parameter. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/about-versions.html#version2.2.x\n\
