  - CVE-2022-31080
summary: |
  DoS in KubeEdge's Websocket Client in package Viaduct
  ### Impact
  A large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large body.
  The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. It will be affected If users which are authenticated to the edge side and connect from the edge side to `cloudhub` through WebSocket protocol.

  ### Patches
  This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

  ### Workarounds
  At the time of writing, no workaround exists.

  ### References
