  - CVE-2023-2801
summary: "Grafana Missing Synchronization vulnerability\nGrafana is an open-source platform\
  \ for monitoring and observability. \n\nUsing public dashboards users can query multiple distinct\
  \ data sources using mixed queries. However such query has a possibility of crashing a Grafana\
  \ instance.\n\nThe only feature that uses mixed queries at the moment is public dashboards,\
  \ but it's also possible to cause this by calling the query API directly.\n\nThis might enable\
  \ malicious users to crash Grafana instances through that endpoint.\n\nUsers may upgrade to\
  \ version 9.4.12 and 9.5.3 to receive a fix."
