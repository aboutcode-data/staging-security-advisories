aliases:
  - CVE-2024-1968
summary: |
  Scrapy leaks the authorization header on same-domain but cross-origin redirects
  ### Impact

  Since version 2.11.1, Scrapy drops the `Authorization` header when a request is redirected to a different domain. However, it keeps the header if the domain remains the same but the scheme (http/https) or the port change, all scenarios where the header should also be dropped.

  In the context of a man-in-the-middle attack, this could be used to get access to the value of that `Authorization` header

  ### Patches

  Upgrade to Scrapy 2.11.2.

  ### Workarounds

  There is no easy workaround for unpatched versions of Scrapy. You can replace the built-in redirect middlewares with custom ones patched for this issue, but you have to patch them yourself, manually.
