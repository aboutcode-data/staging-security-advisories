summary: |
  Parse Server Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in File Upload via URI Format
  ### Impact

  A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the file upload functionality when trying to upload a `Parse.File` with `uri` parameter allows to execute an arbitrary URI. The vulnerability stems from a file upload feature in which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI that is provided in the request. A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response is not stored in Parse Server's file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response.

  ### Patches

  The feature has been implemented in Parse Server 4.2.0 but never worked and reliably crashes the server when trying to use it due to a bug in its implementation. Since the feature is not currently working, and due to its risky nature, it has been removed to address the vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds

  None.
