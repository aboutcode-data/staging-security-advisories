  - CVE-2023-30542
summary: |
  GovernorCompatibilityBravo may trim proposal calldata
  ### Impact

  The proposal creation entrypoint (`propose`) in `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows the creation of proposals with a `signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas` array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without any calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents what will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through `getActions` appear to respect the original intended calldata.

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in v4.8.3.

  ### Workarounds

  Ensure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures` and `calldatas` parameters.
