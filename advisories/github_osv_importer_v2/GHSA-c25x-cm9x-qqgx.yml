summary: |
  Deno improperly handles resizable ArrayBuffer
  ### Impact

  [Resizable ArrayBuffers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-resizablearraybuffer) passed to asynchronous native functions that are shrunk during the asynchronous operation could result in an out-of-bound read/write.

  It is unlikely that this has been exploited in the wild, as the only version affected is Deno 1.32.0.

  Deno Deploy users are not affected.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been resolved by disabling resizable ArrayBuffers temporarily in Deno 1.32.1. A future version of Deno will re-enable resizable ArrayBuffers with a proper fix.

  ### Workarounds

  Upgrade to Deno 1.32.1, or run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable ArrayBuffers.
