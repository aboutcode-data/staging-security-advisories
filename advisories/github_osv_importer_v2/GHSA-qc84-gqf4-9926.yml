summary: "crossbeam-utils Unsoundness of AtomicCell<{i,u}64> arithmetics on 32-bit targets that\
  \ support Atomic{I,U}64\n### Impact\n\nThe affected versions of this crate incorrectly assumed\
  \ that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. \n\nHowever, the\
  \ alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`.\n\nThis can\
  \ cause the following problems:\n\n- Unaligned memory accesses\n- Data race\n\nCrates using\
  \ `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue.\n\n32-bit targets\
  \ without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue.\n32-bit targets\
  \ with `Atomic{I,U}64` and `{i,u}64` have the same alignment are also not affected by this\
  \ issue.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the builtin targets that may be affected.\
  \ (last update: nightly-2022-02-11)\n\n- armv7-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- armv7s-apple-ios (tier\
  \ 3)\n- i386-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- i586-unknown-linux-gnu\n- i586-unknown-linux-musl\n- i686-apple-darwin\
  \ (tier 3)\n- i686-linux-android\n- i686-unknown-freebsd\n- i686-unknown-haiku (tier 3)\n\
  - i686-unknown-linux-gnu\n- i686-unknown-linux-musl\n- i686-unknown-netbsd (tier 3)\n- i686-unknown-openbsd\
  \ (tier 3)\n- i686-wrs-vxworks (tier 3)\n\n([script to get list](https://gist.github.com/taiki-e/3c7891e8c5f5e0cbcb44d7396aabfe10))\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7.\n\nAffected 0.8.x releases\
  \ have been yanked.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/781\
