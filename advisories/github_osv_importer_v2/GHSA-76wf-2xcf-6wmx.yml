  Malicious Package in ngx-pica
  Version 1.1.5 of `ngx-pica` contained malicious code. The code when executed in the browser would enumerate password, cvc and cardnumber fields from forms and send the extracted values to `https://js-metrics.com/minjs.php?pl=`



  ## Recommendation

  Remove the package from your environment and evaluate your application to determine whether or not user data was compromised.

  Users may consider downgrading to version 1.1.4
