aliases:
  - CVE-2024-53863
summary: |
  Synapse can be forced to thumbnail unexpected file formats, invoking external, potentially untrustworthy decoders
  ### Impact

  In Synapse versions before 1.120.1, enabling the `dynamic_thumbnails` option or processing a specially crafted request could trigger the decoding and thumbnail generation of uncommon image formats, potentially invoking external tools like Ghostscript for processing.

  This significantly expands the attack surface in a historically vulnerable area, presenting a risk that far outweighs the benefit, particularly since these formats are rarely used on the open web or within the Matrix ecosystem.

  For a list of image formats, as well as decoding libraries and helper programs used, see [the Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html).

  ### Patches

  Synapse 1.120.1 addresses the issue by restricting thumbnail generation to images in the following widely used formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP.

  ### Workarounds

  - Ensure any image codecs and helper programs, such as Ghostscript, are patched against security vulnerabilities.
  - Uninstall unused image decoder libraries and helper programs, such as Ghostscript, from the system environment that Synapse is running in.
      - Depending on the installation method, there may be some decoder libraries bundled with Pillow and these cannot be easily uninstalled.
      - The official Docker container image does not include Ghostscript.

  ### References

  - [The Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) includes a list of supported image formats and which libraries or helper programs are used to decode them.
