summary: |
  CSRF issue on preview pages in Bolt CMS
  ### Impact

  Bolt CMS lacked CSRF protection in the preview generating endpoint. Previews are intended to be generated by the admins, developers, chief-editors, and editors, who are authorized to create content in the application. But due to lack of proper CSRF protection, unauthorized users could generate a preview.

  ### Patches

  This has been fixed in Bolt 3.7.1
