  buildalon/setup-steamcmd leaked authentication token in job output logs
  ### Summary
  Log output includes authentication token that provides full account access

  ### Details
  The post job action prints the contents of `config/config.vdf` which holds the saved authentication token and can be used to sign in on another machine. This means any public use of this action leaves authentication tokes for the associated steam accounts publicly available. Additionally, `userdata/$user_id$/config/localconfig.vdf` contains potentially sensitive information which should not be included in public logs.

  ### PoC
  Use the following workflow step
  ```
  steps:
        - name: Setup SteamCMD
          uses: buildalon/setup-steamcmd@v1.0.4

        - name: Sign into steam
          shell: bash
          run: |
            steamcmd +login ${{ secrets.WORKSHOP_USERNAME }} ${{ secrets.WORKSHOP_PASSWORD }} +quit
  ```

  ### Impact
  Anyone who has used this workflow action with a steam account is affected and has had valid authentication tokens leaked in the job logs. This is particularly bad for public repositories, as anyone with a GitHub account can access the logs and view the token.
