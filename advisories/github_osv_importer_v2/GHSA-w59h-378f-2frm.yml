  Unsound sending of non-Send types across threads in threadalone
  Affected versions can run the `Drop` impl of a non-Send type on a different
  thread than it was created on.

  The flaw occurs when a stderr write performed by the `threadalone` crate fails,
  for example because stderr is redirected to a location on a filesystem that is
  full, or because stderr is a pipe that has been closed by the reader.

  Dropping a non-Send type on the wrong thread is unsound. If used with a type
  such as a pthread-based `MutexGuard`, [the consequence is undefined
  behavior][mutexguard]. If used with `Rc`, there would be a data race on the
  reference count, which is likewise undefined behavior.
