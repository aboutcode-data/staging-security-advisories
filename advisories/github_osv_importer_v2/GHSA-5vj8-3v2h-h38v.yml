  Remote Code Execution in next
  Versions of `next` prior to 5.1.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The `/path:` route fails to properly sanitize input and passes it to a `require()` call. This allows attackers to execute JavaScript code on the server. Note that prior version 0.9.9 package `next` npm package hosted a different utility (0.4.1 being the latest version of that codebase), and this advisory does not apply to those versions.

  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 5.1.0.
