summary: "Deno is vulnerable to race condition via interactive permission prompt spoofing\n\
  ### Impact\n\nMulti-threaded programs were able to spoof interactive permission prompt by\
  \ rewriting the prompt to suggest that program is waiting on user confirmation to unrelated\
  \ action. \n\nA malicious program could clear the terminal screen after permission prompt\
  \ was shown and write a generic message like so:\n```\n// Expected prompt\n⚠️  ┌ Deno requests\
  \ read access to \"./log.txt\".\n   ├ Requested by `Deno.open()` API\n   ├ Run again with\
  \ --allow-read to bypass this prompt.\n   └ Allow? [y/n] (y = yes, allow; n = no, deny) >\n\
  \n// Prompt that users would see\nDo you want to continue?\n```\n\nThis situation impacts\
  \ users who use Web Worker API and relied on interactive permission prompt. The reproduction\
  \ is very timing sensitive and can’t be reliably reproduced on every try.\n\nThis problem\
  \ can not be exploited on systems that do not attach an interactive prompt (for example headless\
  \ servers). \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in Deno v1.29.3; it is recommended\
  \ all users update to this version.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRun with `--no-prompt` flag to disable\
  \ interactive permission prompts."
