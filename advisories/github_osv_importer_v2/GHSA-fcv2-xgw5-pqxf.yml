summary: "sigstore legacy TUF client allows for arbitrary file writes with target cache path\
  \ traversal\n## Summary\n\nThe legacy TUF client `pkg/tuf/client.go`, which supports caching\
  \ target files to disk, constructs a filesystem path by joining a cache base directory with\
  \ a target name sourced from signed target metadata, but it does not validate that the resulting\
  \ path stays within the cache base directory.\n\nNote that this should only affect clients\
  \ that are directly using the TUF client in sigstore/sigstore or are using an older version\
  \ of Cosign. As this TUF client implementation is deprecated, users should migrate to https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/tree/main/pkg/tuf\
  \ as soon as possible.\n\nNote that this does not affect users of the public Sigstore deployment,\
  \ where TUF metadata is validated by a quorum of trusted collaborators. \n\n## Impact\n\n\
  A malicious TUF repository can trigger arbitrary file overwriting, limited to the permissions\
  \ that the calling process has.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers can disable disk caching for the\
  \ legacy client by setting `SIGSTORE_NO_CACHE=true` in the environment, migrate to https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go/tree/main/pkg/tuf,\
  \ or upgrade to the latest sigstore/sigstore release."
