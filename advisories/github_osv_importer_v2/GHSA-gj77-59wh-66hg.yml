  - CVE-2021-32723
summary: |
  Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Prism
  Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

  ### Impact

  When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

  - ASCIIDoc
  - ERB

  Other languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.

  ### Patches
  This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.
