summary: |
  Etcd embed auto compaction retention negative value causing a compaction loop or a crash
  ### Impact
  Data Validation

  ### Detail
  The parseCompactionRetention function in embed/etcd.go allows the retention variable value to be negative and causes the node to execute the history compaction in a loop, taking more CPU than usual and spamming logs.
