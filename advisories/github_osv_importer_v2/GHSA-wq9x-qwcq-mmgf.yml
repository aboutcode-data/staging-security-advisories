summary: "Diesel vulnerable to Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing\
  \ Casts\nThe following presentation at this year's DEF CON was brought to our attention on\
  \ the Diesel Gitter Channel:\n\n> SQL Injection isn't Dead: Smuggling Queries at the Protocol\
  \ Level  \n> <http://web.archive.org/web/20240812130923/https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/DEF%20CON%2032%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2032%20-%20Paul%20Gerste%20-%20SQL%20Injection%20Isn't%20Dead%20Smuggling%20Queries%20at%20the%20Protocol%20Level.pdf>\
  \  \n> (Archive link for posterity.)\nEssentially, encoding a value larger than 4GiB can cause\
  \ the length prefix in the protocol to overflow, \ncausing the server to interpret the rest\
  \ of the string as binary protocol commands or other data.\n\nIt appears Diesel _does_ perform\
  \ truncating casts in a way that could be problematic, \nfor example: <https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/ae82c4a5a133db65612b7436356f549bfecda1c7/diesel/src/pg/connection/stmt/mod.rs#L36>\n\
  \nThis code has existed essentially since the beginning, \nso it is reasonable to assume that\
  \ all published versions `<= 2.2.2` are affected.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe prefered migration\
  \ to the outlined problem is to update to a Diesel version newer than 2.2.2, which includes\
  \ \nfixes for the problem. \n\nAs always, you should make sure your application is validating\
  \ untrustworthy user input. \nReject any input over 4 GiB, or any input that could _encode_\
  \ to a string longer than 4 GiB. \nDynamically built queries are also potentially problematic\
  \ if it pushes the message size over this 4 GiB bound.\n\nFor web application backends, consider\
  \ adding some middleware that limits the size of request bodies by default.\n\n## Resolution\n\
  \nDiesel now uses `#[deny]` directives for the following Clippy lints:\n\n* [`cast_possible_truncation`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_truncation)\n\
  * [`cast_possible_wrap`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_wrap)\n\
  * [`cast_sign_loss`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_sign_loss)\n\n\
  to prevent casts that will lead to precision loss or other trunctations. Additionally we performed\
  \ an \naudit of the relevant code.\n\nA fix is included in the `2.2.3` release."
