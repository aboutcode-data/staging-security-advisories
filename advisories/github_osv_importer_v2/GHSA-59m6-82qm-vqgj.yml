summary: |
  Dapr API token authentication bypass in HTTP endpoints
  ### Summary


  A vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing [API token authentication](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/), which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request.


  Users who leverage API token authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.


  ### Impact


  This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token authentication. An attacker could craft a request that is always allowed by the Dapr sidecar over HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in the request is invalid or missing.


  ### Patches


  The issue has been fixed in Dapr 1.10.9 and 1.11.2.


  ### Details


  When API token authentication is enabled, Dapr requires all calls from applications to include the `dapr-api-token` header, with a value matching what's included in the Dapr's configuration. In order to allow for healthchecks to work, the `/v1.0/healthz` and `/v1.0/healthz/outbound` HTTP APIs are excluded from the API token authentication check, and are always allowed.


  Dapr <= 1.10.8 and <= 1.11.1 implemented the allowlisting of the healthcheck endpoints by permitting all requests whose URL contains `/healthz` to bypass the API token authentication check. The match applied anywhere in the URL, including the querystring.


  As a consequence, attackers were able to bypass API token authentication by including `/healthz` anywhere in the URL, including as a querystring parameter. This allowed attackers to invoke any Dapr API using HTTP, including perform service invocation.
