aliases:
  - CVE-2023-52079
summary: |
  msgpackr's conversion of property names to strings can trigger infinite recursion
  ### Impact
  When decoding user supplied MessagePack messages, users can trigger stuck threads by crafting messages that keep the decoder stuck in a loop.

  ### Patches
  The fix is available in v1.10.1

  ### Workarounds
  Exploits seem to require structured cloning, replacing the 0x70 extension with your own (that throws an error or does something other than recursive referencing) should mitigate the issue.
