summary: |
  Users with ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN can create new users in Opencast
  ### Impact

  Users with the role `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` can use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the role `ROLE_ADMIN`. For example:

  ```bash
  # Use the admin to create a new user with ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN using the admin user.
  # We expect this to work.
  % curl -i -u admin:opencast 'https://example.opencast.org/user-utils/xy.json' -X PUT \
    --data 'password=f&roles=%5B%22ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN%22%5D'
  HTTP/2 201

  # Use the new user to create more new users.
  # We don't expüect a user with just role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN to succeed.
  # But it does work
  % curl -i -u xy:f 'https://example.opencast.org/user-utils/ab.json' -X PUT \
    --data 'password=f&roles=%5B%22ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN%22%5D'
  HTTP/2 201
  ```
  `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` is a non-standard role in Opencast which is referenced neither in the documentation nor in any code (except for tests) but only in the security configuration. From the name – implying an admin for a specific course – users would never expect that this role allows user creation.

  ### Patches

  This issue is fixed in 7.6 and 8.1 which both ship a new default security configuration.

  ### Workarounds

  You can fix this issue by removing all instances of `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` in your organization's security configuration (`etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` by default).
