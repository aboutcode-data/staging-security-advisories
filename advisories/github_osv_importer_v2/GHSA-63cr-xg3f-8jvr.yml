summary: "Leantime allows Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n### Summary\nStored XSS, also known\
  \ as persistent XSS, is the more damaging of the two. It occurs when a malicious script is\
  \ injected directly into a vulnerable web application. \n\n### Details\nA Stored Cross-Site\
  \ Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found that could potentially compromise user data and\
  \ pose a significant security risk to the platform.\n\n### PoC\n\n- Create a project\n- Navigate\
  \ to project\n- Visit to the integration\n- Add malicious payload inside the webhook and save\
  \ it.\n- Notice the alert dialogue indicating successful execution of the XSS payload.\n```\n\
  '';!--\" onfocus=alert(0) autofocus=\"\"  onload=alert(3);=\"&amp;{(alert(1))}\" |=\"\" mufazmi\"\
  =\"\n```\n```\n'';!--\" onfocus=alert(0) autofocus=\"\"  onload=alert(3);=>>\"&amp;{(alert(1))}\"\
  \ |=\"\">> mufazmi\"=\">>\n```\n### POC\nhttps://youtu.be/kqKFgsOqstg\n\n\n### Impact\nThis\
  \ XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's\
  \ browser when they click on a specially crafted link. This could lead to various malicious\
  \ activities, including session hijacking, stealing sensitive information such as cookies\
  \ or login credentials, and potentially compromising the entire platform's security."
