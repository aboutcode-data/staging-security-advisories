  - CVE-2023-46742
summary: "CubeFS leaks users key in logs\nCubeFS was found to leak users secret keys and access\
  \ keys in the logs in multiple components.  When CubeCS creates new users, it leaks the users\
  \ secret key. This could allow a lower-privileged user with access to the logs to retrieve\
  \ sensitive information and impersonate other users with higher privileges than themselves.\
  \ \n\nThere is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. It was found\
  \ during an ongoing security audit carried out by [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/) in\
  \ collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).\n\n\
  The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than upgrading CubeFS."
