summary: "Vulnerable version of libwebp and can be exploited with a malicious source image\n\
  ### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability affects deployments of FreeImage that involve decoding or\
  \ processing malicious source .webp files. If you only process your own trusted files, this\
  \ should not affect you, but **you should remove FreeImage from your project, as it is not\
  \ maintained and presents a massive security risk**. \n\nIf you are using FreeImage via  ImageResizer.Plugins.FreeImage,\
  \ please utilize [Imageflow](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow) or [Imageflow.Server](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow-dotnet-server)\
  \ instead, or upgrade to ImageResizer 5 and use ImageResizer.Plugins.Imageflow (enable Prereleases\
  \ on NuGet to access). \n\nFreeImage relies on Google's [libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp)\
  \ library to decode .webp images, and is affected by the recent zero-day out-of-bounds write\
  \ vulnerability [CVE-2023-4863](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863) and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr.\
  \ The libwebp vulnerability also affects Chrome, Android, macOS, and other consumers of the\
  \ library).\n\nlibwebp patched [the vulnerability](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/commit/2af26267cdfcb63a88e5c74a85927a12d6ca1d76\
  \ ) and released [1.3.2](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/releases/tag/v1.3.2). FreeImage\
  \ hasn't been updated since then and is presumed vulnerable. \n\n### Patches\n\nNone. FreeImage\
  \ has not been updated in several years.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n If you are using ImageResizer.Plugins.FreeImage,\
  \ please utilize [Imageflow](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow) or [Imageflow.Server](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow-dotnet-server)\
  \ instead, or upgrade to ImageResizer 5 and use ImageResizer.Plugins.Imageflow (enable Prereleases\
  \ on NuGet to access). \n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr\n\
