  - CVE-2022-24721
summary: |
  Improper Authorization in org.cometd.oort
  ### Impact
  Internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels.
  By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other user's (possibly sensitive) data.
  By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure.
  The issue impacts any version up to 5.0.10, 6.0.5 and 7.0.5.

  ### Patches
  The issue has been fixed in 5.0.11, 6.0.6 and 7.0.6.

  ### Workarounds
  The workaround is to install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.
  This workaround could be implemented in any affected version.
