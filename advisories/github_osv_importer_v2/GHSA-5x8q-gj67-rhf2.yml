  Malicious Package in discord_debug_log
  All versions of `discord_debug_log` contain obfuscated malware that uploads Discord user tokens to a remote server. This allows attackers to make purchases on behalf of users if they have credit cards linked to their Discord accounts.


  ## Recommendation

  Remove the package from your environment. Review your Discord account access and rotate tokens if possible. If a credit card was linked to a compromised account contact your credit card company.
