aliases:
  - CVE-2026-25593
summary: |
  OpenClaw vulnerable to Unauthenticated Local RCE via WebSocket config.apply
  ### Summary

  An unauthenticated local client could use the Gateway WebSocket API to write config via `config.apply` and set unsafe `cliPath` values that were later used for command discovery, enabling command injection as the gateway user.

  ### Impact

  A local process on the same machine could execute arbitrary commands as the gateway process user.

  ### Details

  - `config.apply` accepted raw JSON and wrote it to disk after schema validation.
  - `cliPath` values were not constrained to safe executable names/paths.
  - Command discovery used a shell invocation when resolving executables.

  ### Mitigation

  Upgrade to a patched release. If projects cannot upgrade immediately, set `gateway.auth` and avoid custom `cliPath` values.
