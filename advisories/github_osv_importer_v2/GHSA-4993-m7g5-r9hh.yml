aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15115
summary: |
  etcd has no minimum password length
  ### Vulnerability type
  Access Control

  ### Workarounds
  The etcdctl and etcd API do not enforce a specific password length during user creation or user password update operations. [It is the responsibility of the administrator to enforce these requirements](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/authentication.md#notes-on-password-strength).

  ### Detail
  etcd does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force users’ passwords with little computational effort.
