summary: |
  Infinite open connection causes OctoRPKI to hang forever
  OctoRPKI (github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/cmd/octorpki) does not limit the length of a connection, allowing for a slowloris DOS attack to take place which makes OctoRPKI wait forever. Specifically, the repository that OctoRPKI sends HTTP requests to will keep the connection open for a day before a response is returned, but does keep drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection alive.
