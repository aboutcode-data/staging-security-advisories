summary: |
  Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE
  ### Impact
  A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

  ### Patches
  This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.9.0 by ensuring schema validation was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements.

  ### Workarounds
  To work around this vulnerability, either:
  - Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.9.0 or higher
  - Manually sanitize the content using the `BeforeSetContent` event (see below)

  #### Example: Manually sanitize content
  ```js
  editor.on('BeforeSetContent', function(e) {
    var sanitizedContent = ...; // Manually sanitize content here
    e.content = sanitizedContent;
  });
  ```

  ### Acknowledgements
  Tiny Technologies would like to thank William Bowling for discovering this vulnerability.
