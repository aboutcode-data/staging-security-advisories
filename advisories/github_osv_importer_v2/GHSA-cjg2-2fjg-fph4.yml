summary: |
  Integer underflow in Frontier
  ### Impact

  A bug in Frontier's MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. It is recommended that you apply the patch as soon as possible.

  If you do not use MODEXP precompile in your runtime, then you are not impacted.

  ### Patches

  Patches are applied in PR #549.

  ### Workarounds
