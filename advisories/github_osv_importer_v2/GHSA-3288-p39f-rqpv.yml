  Unsoundness in opt-in ARMv8 assembly backend for `keccak`
  ### Summary

  The `asm!` block enabled by the off-by-default `asm` feature, when enabled on ARMv8 targets, misspecified the operand
  type for all of its operands, using `in` for pointers and values which were subsequently mutated by operations performed
  within the assembly block.

  ### Impact

  It's unclear what practical impact, if any, this actually had. Incorrect operand types are technically undefined
  behavior, however changing them had no actual impact on the generated assembly for these targets. The possibility still
  exists that it may lead to potential memory safety or other issues on hypothetical future versions of rustc.

  ### Mitigation

  The operand types were changed from `in` to `inout`, and the impacted versions of the `keccak` crate were yanked.
