aliases:
  - CVE-2025-67507
summary: |
  Filament multi-factor authentication (app) recovery codes can be used multiple times
  ### Summary

  A flaw in the handling of recovery codes for **app-based multi-factor authentication** allows the same recovery code to be reused indefinitely. This issue does **not** affect email-based MFA. It also only applies when recovery codes are enabled.

  ### Impact

  If an attacker gains access to both the user's password and their recovery codes, they can repeatedly complete MFA without the user's app-based second factor. This weakens the expected security of MFA by turning recovery codes into a static, long-term bypass method.
