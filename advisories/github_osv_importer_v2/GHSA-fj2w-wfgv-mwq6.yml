  - CVE-2024-23684
summary: "Denial of service in CBOR library\n### Impact\nDue to this library's use of an inefficient\
  \ algorithm, it is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when a maliciously crafted input\
  \ is passed to `DecodeFromBytes` or other CBOR decoding mechanisms in this library.  \n\n\
  Affected versions _include_ versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0.\n\nThis vulnerability was privately\
  \ reported to me.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in version 4.5.1.  Users should\
  \ use the latest version of this library.  (The latest version is not necessarily 4.5.1. \
  \ Check the README for [this library's repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR-Java)\
  \ to see the latest version's version number.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAgain, users should use\
  \ the latest version of this library.\n\nIn the meantime, note that the inputs affected by\
  \ this issue are all CBOR maps or contain CBOR maps.  An input that decodes to a single CBOR\
  \ object is not capable of containing a CBOR map if&mdash;\n\n- it begins with a byte other\
  \ than 0x80 through 0xDF, or\n- it does not contain a byte in the range 0xa0 through 0xBF.\n\
  \nSuch an input is not affected by this vulnerability and an application can choose to perform\
  \ this check before passing it to a CBOR decoding mechanism.\n\n### For more information\n\
  If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the CBOR repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR-Java)."
