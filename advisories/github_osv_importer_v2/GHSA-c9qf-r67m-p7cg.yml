summary: "Null pointer dereference in `CompressElement`\n### Impact\nIt is possible to trigger\
  \ a null pointer dereference in TensorFlow by passing an invalid input to `tf.raw_ops.CompressElement`:\n\
  \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.CompressElement(components=[[]])\n```\n\
  \  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/data/compression_utils.cc#L34)\
  \ was accessing the size of a buffer obtained from the return of a separate function call\
  \ before validating that said buffer is valid.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in\
  \ GitHub commit [5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5).\n\
  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow\
  \ 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported\
  \ range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ for  more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and\
  \ questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul\
  \ Team from Qihoo 360. Concurrently, it was resolved in `master` branch as it was also discovered\
  \ internally and fixed before the report was handled."
