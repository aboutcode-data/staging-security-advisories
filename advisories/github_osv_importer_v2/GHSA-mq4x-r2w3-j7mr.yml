  - CVE-2024-28197
summary: "Account Takeover via Session Fixation in Zitadel [Bypassing MFA]\n### Impact\nZITADEL\
  \ uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions. \n\nAlthough the\
  \ cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL\
  \ instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on\
  \ the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim’s account in certain scenarios. \n\
  A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work.\
  \ \n\nIf the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed.\
  \ The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain.\
  \ This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an\
  \ application hosted on a subdomain.\n\n### Patches\n2.x versions are fixed on >= [2.46.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.46.0)\n\
  2.45.x versions are fixed on >= [2.45.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.45.1)\n\
  2.44.x versions are fixed on >= [2.44.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.44.3)\n\
  \nZITADEL recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course.\n\nNote that\
  \ applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start\
  \ a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following\
  \ cookie name on subdomains of your ZITADEL instance (e.g. within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`\n\
  \n### References\nNone\n\n### Questions\nIf you have any questions or comments about this\
  \ advisory, please email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n\n###\
  \ Credits\nThanks to Amit Laish – GE Vernova for finding and reporting the vulnerability."
