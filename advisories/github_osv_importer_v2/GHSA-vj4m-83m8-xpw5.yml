summary: |
  OpenFGA Authorization Bypass via tupleset wildcard
  ### Overview
  During our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions `v0.2.3` and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.

  ### Am I affected?
  You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version `v0.2.3` and you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement).

  ### How to fix that?
  Upgrade to version `v0.2.4`.

  ### Backward Compatibility
  This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.
