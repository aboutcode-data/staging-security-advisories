summary: "Improper Privilege Management in Cilium\n### Impact\n\nIf an attacker is able to perform\
  \ a container escape of a container running as root on a host where Cilium is installed, the\
  \ attacker can leverage Cilium's Kubernetes service account to gain access to cluster privileges\
  \ that are more permissive than what is minimally required to operate Cilium. In affected\
  \ releases, this service account had access to modify and delete `Pod` and `Node` resources.\
  \ \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed and is available on versions >=1.9.16, >=1.10.11,\
  \ >=1.11.5\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds available.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\
  \nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent, Amazon and Palo Alto\
  \ Networks to prepare these mitigations.  Special thanks to Micah Hausler (AWS), Robert Clark\
  \ (AWS), Yuval Avrahami (Palo Alto Networks), and Shaul Ben Hai (Palo Alto Networks) for their\
  \ cooperation.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about\
  \ this advisory:\n\nEmail us at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io)"
