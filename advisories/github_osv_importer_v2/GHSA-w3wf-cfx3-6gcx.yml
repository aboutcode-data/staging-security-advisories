  - CVE-2020-26276
summary: |
  SAML authentication vulnerability due to stdlib XML parsing
  ### Impact
  Due to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP.

  Users that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue.

  ### Patches
  This issue is patched in 3.5.1 using https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator.

  ### Workarounds
  If upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.

  ### References
  See https://mattermost.com/blog/coordinated-disclosure-go-xml-vulnerabilities/ for more information about the underlying vulnerabilities.
