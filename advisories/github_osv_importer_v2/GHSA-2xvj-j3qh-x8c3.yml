summary: |
  private_address_check contains race condition
  The private_address_check ruby gem before 0.5.0 is vulnerable to a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition due to the address the socket uses not being checked. DNS entries with a TTL of 0 can trigger this case where the initial resolution is a public address but the subsequent resolution is a private address.
