summary: |
  OpenFGA Improper Policy Enforcement
  ### Impact
  OpenFGA v1.8.5 to v1.11.2 ( openfga-0.2.22 <= Helm chart <= openfga-0.2.51, v.1.8.5 <= docker <= v.1.11.2) are vulnerable to improper policy enforcement when certain Check calls are executed.


  ### Affected Users
  Users are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following preconditions are met:
  - OpenFGA v1.8.5 to v1.11.2 is being used
  - The model has a relation directly assignable by a [type bound public access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access) and assignable by type bound non-public access
  - A tuple is assigned for the relation that is a type bound public access
  - A tuple is assigned for the same object with the same relation that is not type bound public access
  - A tuple is assigned for a different object that has an object ID lexicographically larger with the same user and relation which is not type bound public access


  ### Fix
  Upgrade to v1.11.3. This upgrade is backwards compatible.

  ### Workaround
