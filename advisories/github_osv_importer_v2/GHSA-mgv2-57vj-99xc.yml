  Low severity vulnerability that affects eye.js
  ## Test breaking

  ### Impact
  In v1.2.0, tests are broken: all tests are always succeeding. If tests are looking for security vulnerabilities, these were compromised.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to `v1.2.1`

  ### Workarounds
  Users who don't use eye.js for looking for vulnerabilities are safe. Upgrading will just fix some bugs.
