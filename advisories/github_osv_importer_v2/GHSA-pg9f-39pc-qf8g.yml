summary: |
  crossbeam-channel Vulnerable to Double Free on Drop
  The internal `Channel` type's `Drop` method has a race
  which could, in some circumstances, lead to a double-free.
  This could result in memory corruption.

  Quoting from the
  [upstream description in merge request \#1187](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1187#issue-2980761131):

  > The problem lies in the fact that `dicard_all_messages` contained two paths that could lead to `head.block` being read but only one of them would swap the value. This meant that `dicard_all_messages` could end up observing a non-null block pointer (and therefore attempting to free it) without setting `head.block` to null. This would then lead to `Channel::drop` making a second attempt at dropping the same pointer.

  The bug was introduced while fixing a memory leak, in
  upstream [MR \#1084](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1084),
  first published in 0.5.12.

  The fix is in
  upstream [MR \#1187](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/1187)
  and has been published in 0.5.15
