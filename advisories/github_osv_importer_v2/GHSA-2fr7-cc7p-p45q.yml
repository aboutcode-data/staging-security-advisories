  - CVE-2023-49280
summary: "Data leak of password hash through change requests\n### Impact\n\nChange request allows\
  \ to edit any page by default, and the changes are then exported in an XML that anyone can\
  \ download. So it's possible for an attacker to obtain password hash of users by performing\
  \ edition of the user profiles and then downloading the XML that has been created. This is\
  \ also true for any document that might contain password field and that a user can view.\n\
  This vulnerability impacts all version of Change Request, but the impact depends on the rights\
  \ that has been set on the wiki since it requires for the user to have the Change request\
  \ right (allowed by default) and view rights on the page to target. \nAlso the issue cannot\
  \ be easily exploited in an automated way. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch consists in denying\
  \ to users the right of editing pages that contains a password field with change request.\
  \ It means that already existing change request for those pages won't be removed by the patch,\
  \ administrators needs to take care of it. \n\nThe patch is provided in Change Request 1.10,\
  \ administrators should upgrade immediately. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to workaround\
  \ the vulnerability by denying manually the Change request right on some spaces, such as XWiki\
  \ space which will include any user profile by default. \n\n### References\n\n  * JIRA issue:\
