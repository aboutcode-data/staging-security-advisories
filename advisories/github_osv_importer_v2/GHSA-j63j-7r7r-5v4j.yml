aliases:
  - CVE-2024-7096
summary: |
  WSO2 products vulnerable to privilege escalation due to business logic flaw in SOAP admin services
  A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to a business logic flaw in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions only when all of the following conditions are met:
    *  SOAP admin services are accessible to the attacker.
    *  The deployment includes an internally used attribute that is not part of the default WSO2 product configuration.
    *  At least one custom role exists with non-default permissions.
    *  The attacker has knowledge of the custom role and the internal attribute used in the deployment.


  Exploiting this vulnerability allows malicious actors to assign higher privileges to self-registered users, bypassing intended access control mechanisms.
