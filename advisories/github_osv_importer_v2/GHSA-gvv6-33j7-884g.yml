  - CVE-2024-47872
summary: "Gradio has an XSS on every Gradio server via upload of HTML files, JS files, or SVG\
  \ files\n### Impact  \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ involves **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** on any Gradio server that allows file uploads. Authenticated\
  \ users can upload files such as HTML, JavaScript, or SVG files containing malicious scripts.\
  \ When other users download or view these files, the scripts will execute in their browser,\
  \ allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions or steal sensitive information from their\
  \ sessions. This impacts any Gradio server that allows file uploads, particularly those using\
  \ components that process or display user-uploaded files.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade\
  \ to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to\
  \ fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nAs a workaround, users can restrict\
  \ the types of files that can be uploaded to the Gradio server by limiting uploads to non-executable\
  \ file types such as images or text. Additionally, developers can implement server-side validation\
  \ to sanitize uploaded files, ensuring that HTML, JavaScript, and SVG files are properly handled\
  \ or rejected before being stored or displayed to users."
