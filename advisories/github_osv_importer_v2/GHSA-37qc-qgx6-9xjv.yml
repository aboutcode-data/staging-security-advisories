  - CVE-2024-47166
summary: "Gradio has a one-level read path traversal in `/custom_component`\n### Impact  \n\
  **What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability involves a **one-level\
  \ read path traversal** in the `/custom_component` endpoint. Attackers can exploit this flaw\
  \ to access and leak source code from custom Gradio components by manipulating the file path\
  \ in the request. Although the traversal is limited to a single directory level, it could\
  \ expose proprietary or sensitive code that developers intended to keep private. This impacts\
  \ users who have developed custom Gradio components and are hosting them on publicly accessible\
  \ servers.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=4.44` to address this issue.\n\
  \n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without\
  \ upgrading?**\n\nAs a workaround, developers can sanitize the file paths and ensure that\
  \ components are not stored in publicly accessible directories."
