  - CVE-2020-15271
summary: |
  Markdown-supplied Shell Command Execution
  ### Impact

  lookatme versions prior to 2.3.0 automatically loaded the built-in "terminal" and "file_loader" extensions. Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system.

  ### Patches

  Users should upgrade to lookatme versions 2.3.0 or above.

  ### Workarounds

  The `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.
