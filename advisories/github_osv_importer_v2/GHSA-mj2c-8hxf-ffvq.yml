summary: "Cocotais Bot has builtin .echo command injection\n### Summary\n\uFEFF\nA command echoing\
  \ feature in the framework allows users to indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting\
  \ special platform tags. Specifically, an unauthorized user can use the `/echo <qqbot-at-everyone\
  \ />` command to cause the bot to send a message that mentions all members in the chat, bypassing\
  \ any permission controls. This can lead to spam, disruption, or abuse of notification systems.\n\
  \uFEFF\n### Details\n\uFEFF\nThe framework provides a command `/echo` that causes the bot\
  \ to repeat any user-provided message verbatim in the group chat. However, the bot fails to\
  \ sanitize or filter platform-specific control elements such as `<qqbot-at-everyone />`, which,\
  \ when included in a message, mentions everyone (i.e., @全体成员). While normal users are forbidden\
  \ from using this tag in normal chats, the bot, which has higher privileges, is allowed to\
  \ do so.\n\uFEFF\nSince the `/echo` command blindly echoes any content, a user can exploit\
  \ this by sending:\n\uFEFF\n```\n/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />\n```\n\uFEFF\nThe bot will then\
  \ send a message containing `<qqbot-at-everyone />`, causing the platform to interpret it\
  \ as an @全体成员 command, effectively allowing an unauthorized user to @everyone via the bot.\n\
  \uFEFF\n### PoC\n\uFEFF\n1. Set up a chatbot using the affected framework.\n2. Join the chat\
  \ that includes the bot as a regular user with **no permission to use @全体成员**.\n3. Send the\
  \ following message in the chat:\n\uFEFF\n```\n/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />\n```\n4. The bot\
  \ will respond by repeating the message, and the platform will interpret `<qqbot-at-everyone\
  \ />` as an @全体成员 mention.\n5. All the chat members receive a notification, despite the user\
  \ lacking that permission.\n\uFEFF\n\uFEFF"
