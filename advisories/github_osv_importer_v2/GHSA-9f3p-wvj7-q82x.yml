aliases:
  - CVE-2019-16760
summary: Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency if your package.toml file
  uses the `package` configuration key. Usage of the `package` key to rename dependencies in
  `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust 1.25.0 and prior. When Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo
  may download the wrong dependency, which could be squatted on crates.io to be a malicious
  package. This not only affects manifests that you write locally yourself, but also manifests
  published to crates.io. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because
  Cargo will ignore the `package` key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not
  affected and typically will emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0
  and after are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Users of the affected
  versions are strongly encouraged to update their compiler to the latest available one. Preventing
  this issue from happening requires updating your compiler to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer.
  There will be no point release for Rust versions prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 to
  Rust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches to mitigate the issue.
