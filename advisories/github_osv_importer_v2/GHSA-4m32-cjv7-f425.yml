summary: |
  AstrBot is vulnerable to RCE with hard-coded JWT signing keys
  ### Summary
  AstrBot uses a hard-coded JWT signing key, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands by installing a malicious plugin.

  ### Details

  AstrBot uses a [hard-coded JWT signing key](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/blob/v3.5.16/astrbot/core/__init__.py), which allows attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism. Once bypassed, the attacker can install a Python plugin that will be imported [here](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/blob/master/astrbot/dashboard/routes/plugin.py), enabling arbitrary command execution on the target host.

  ### Impact

  All publicly accessible AstrBot instances are vulnerable.
