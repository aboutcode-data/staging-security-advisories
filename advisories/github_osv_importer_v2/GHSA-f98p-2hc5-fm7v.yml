aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34899
summary: |
  AVideo cross-site scripting vulnerability in the view/about.php page
  The PHP file view/about.php is vulnerable to an XSS issue due to no sanitization of the user agent.

  At line [53], the website gets the user-agent from the headers through $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and echo it without any sanitization.

  In PHP, echo a user generated statement, here the User-Agent Header, without any sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the output of a web page, which are then executed in the browser of anyone viewing that page.
