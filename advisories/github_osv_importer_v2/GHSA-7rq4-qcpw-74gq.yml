  Formula Injection in Exported Data
  ### Impact

  Datasets exported to file (e.g. CSV / XLS) are not sufficiently sanitized, to neutralize potential formula injection

  ### Patches

  - The issue is addressed in the upcoming 0.8.0 release
  - This fix will also be back-ported to the 0.7.x branch, applied to the 0.7.2 release

  ### Workarounds

  Users exporting untrusted data should open the files in safe mode (e.g. in Microsoft Excel).
