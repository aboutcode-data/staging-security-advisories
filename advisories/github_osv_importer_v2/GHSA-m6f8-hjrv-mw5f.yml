summary: "Apiman vulnerable to permissions bypass due to missing check on API key URL\n### Impact\n\
  \nDue to a missing permissions check, an attacker with an authenticated Apiman Manager account\
  \ may be able to gain access to API keys they do not have permission for if they correctly\
  \ guess the URL. The URL includes Organisation ID, Client ID, and Client Version of the targeted\
  \ non-permitted resource, and each of these can have arbitrary values.\n\nWhile not trivial\
  \ to exploit, it could be achieved by brute-forcing or guessing common names.\n\nAccess to\
  \ the non-permitted API Keys could allow use of other users' resources without their permission\
  \ (depending on the specifics of configuration, such as whether an API key is the only form\
  \ of security).\n\n### Patches\n\nApiman 3.1.0.Final and later resolves this issue. \n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\n\nOnly provide Apiman Manager accounts to known users, do not allow anonymous/unknown\
  \ users to create an Apiman Manager account.\n\nNote that this does **not** affect the Apiman\
  \ Gateway.\n\n### References\n\n* [Blog post disclosing issue](https://www.apiman.io/blog/potential-permissions-bypass-disclosure/)"
