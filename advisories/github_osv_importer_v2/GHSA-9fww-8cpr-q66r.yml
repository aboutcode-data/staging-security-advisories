summary: |
  Isso affected by Stored XSS via comment website field
  ## Impact

  This is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the website and author comment fields. The website field was HTML-escaped using quote=False, which left single and double quotes unescaped. Since the frontend inserts the website value directly into a single-quoted href attribute via string concatenation, a single quote in the URL breaks out of the attribute context, allowing injection of arbitrary event handlers (e.g. onmouseover, onclick).

  The same escaping was missing entirely from the user-facing comment edit endpoint (PUT /id/<id>) and the moderation edit endpoint (POST /id/<id>/edit/<key>).

  Any visitor to a page embedding isso comments is impacted. No authentication or interaction beyond mouse movement is required to trigger a payload — an attacker can post a comment anonymously (moderation is off by default) with a crafted website URL, and the payload persists in the database and fires on every page load. With the full-page invisible overlay technique described in the report, the victim only needs to move their mouse.

  ## Patches

  The issue is fixed in commit 3cf27c2. Users should upgrade to a version containing that commit once released. The fix applies html.escape(..., quote=True) to the website field across all three write paths (POST /new, PUT /id/<id>, POST /id/<id>/edit/<key>), and adds input validation and escaping to the moderation edit endpoint which previously had neither.

  ## Workarounds

    Enabling comment moderation (moderation = enabled = true in isso.cfg) prevents unauthenticated users from publishing comments, raising the bar for exploitation. However, it
    does not fully mitigate the issue since a moderator activating a malicious comment would still expose visitors. There is no configuration-only workaround that fully prevents
     the vulnerability.
