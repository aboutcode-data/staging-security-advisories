summary: |
  TensorFlow vulnerable to `CHECK` failure in tf.reshape via overflows
  ### Impact
  The implementation of tf.reshape op in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a denial of service via CHECK-failure (assertion failure) caused by overflowing the number of elements in a tensor:
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf

  tf.reshape(tensor=[[1]],shape=tf.constant([0 for i in range(255)], dtype=tf.int64))
  ```
  This is another instance of [TFSA-2021-198](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md) (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-prcg-wp5q-rv7p).

  ### Patches
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555).

  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
