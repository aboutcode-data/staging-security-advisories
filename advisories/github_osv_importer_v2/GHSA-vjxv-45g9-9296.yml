  - CVE-2022-35929
summary: |
  cosign's `cosign verify-attestaton  --type` can report a false positive if any attestation exists
  `cosign verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification when:

  - There is at least one attestation with a valid signature
  - There are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to "custom")

  This can happen when signing with a standard keypair and with "keyless" signing with Fulcio. Users should upgrade to cosign version 1.10.1 or greater for a patch. Currently the only workaround is to upgrade.
