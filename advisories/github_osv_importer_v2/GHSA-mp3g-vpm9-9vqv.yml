aliases:
  - CVE-2024-38375
summary: |
  @fastly/js-compute has a use-after-free in some host call implementations
  ### Impact
  The implementation of the following functions were determined to include a use-after-free bug:

  * `FetchEvent.client.tlsCipherOpensslName`
  * `FetchEvent.client.tlsProtocol`
  * `FetchEvent.client.tlsClientCertificate`
  * `FetchEvent.client.tlsJA3MD5`
  * `FetchEvent.client.tlsClientHello`
  * `CacheEntry.prototype.userMetadata` of the `fastly:cache` subsystem
  * `Device.lookup` of the `fastly:device` subsystem

  This bug could allow for an unintended data leak if the result of the preceding functions were sent anywhere else, and often results in a Compute service crash causing an HTTP 500 error to be returned. As all requests to Compute are isolated from one another, the only data at risk is data present for a single request.

  ### Patches
  This bug has been fixed in version 3.16.0 of the `@fastly/js-compute` package.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no workarounds for this bug, any use of the affected functions introduces the possibility of a data leak or crash in guest code.
