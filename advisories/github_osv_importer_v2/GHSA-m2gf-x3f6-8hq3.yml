summary: |
  Deno is Vulnerable to Command Injection on Windows During Batch File Execution
  ### Summary
  Deno versions up to 2.5.1 are vulnerable to Command Line Injection attacks on Windows when batch files are executed.

  ### Details
  In Windows, ``CreateProcess()`` always implicitly spawns ``cmd.exe`` if a batch file (.bat, .cmd, etc.) is being executed even if the application does not specify it via the command line. This makes Deno vulnerable to a command injection attack on Windows as demonstrated by the two proves-of-concept below.

  ### PoC
  Using `node:child_process` (with the `env` and `run` permissions):
  ```JS
  const { spawn } = require('node:child_process');
  const child = spawn('./test.bat', ['&calc.exe']);
  ```
  Using `Deno.Command.spawn()` (with the `run` permission):
  ```JS
  const command = new Deno.Command('./test.bat', {
    args: ['&calc.exe'],
  });
  const child = command.spawn();
  ```

  ### Impact
  Both of these scripts result in opening calc.exe on Windows, thus allowing a Command Line Injection attack when user-provided arguments are passed if the script being executed by the child process is a batch script.
