summary: |
  Mautic segment cloning doesn't have a proper permission check
  ### Summary
  This advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic related to the segment cloning functionality. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to clone segments without proper authorization checks.

  Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) / Missing Authorization: A missing authorization vulnerability exists in the `cloneAction` of the segment management. This allows an authenticated user to bypass intended permission restrictions and clone segments even if they lack the necessary permissions to create new ones.

  ### Mitigation
  Update Mautic to a version that implements proper authorization checks for the `cloneAction` within the `ListController.php`. Ensure that users attempting to clone segments possess the appropriate creation permissions.

  ### Workarounds
  None
