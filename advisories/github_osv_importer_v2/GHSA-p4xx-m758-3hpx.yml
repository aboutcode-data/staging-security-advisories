summary: "TYPO3 CMS Webhooks Server Side Request Forgery\n### Problem\nWebhooks are inherently\
  \ vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries\
  \ to target internal resources (e.g., _localhost_ or other services on the local network).\
  \ While this is not a vulnerability in TYPO3 itself, it may enable attackers to blindly access\
  \ systems that would otherwise be inaccessible. An administrator-level backend user account\
  \ is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 12.4.31\
  \ LTS, 13.4.12 LTS that fix the problem described.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n> **Manual actions\
  \ required**\n>\n> To mitigate potential SSRF risks via webhooks, it is recommended to explicitly\
  \ allow access only to trusted hosts. This can be achieved by configuring the allowlist in\
  \ `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']['allowed_hosts']['webhooks']`.\n> \n> If the allowlist\
  \ is not defined or set to `null`, all requests will be allowed.\n> If the allowlist is an\
  \ empty `array`, all requests will be blocked.\n> \n> By default, the factory setting allows\
  \ all requests. This prevents existing webhooks from failing after upgrading to the affected\
  \ TYPO3 versions. Administrators must configure this setting manually to enforce restrictions.\n\
  \n\n### Credits\nThanks to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of Switzerland for reporting\
  \ this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke for fixing it."
