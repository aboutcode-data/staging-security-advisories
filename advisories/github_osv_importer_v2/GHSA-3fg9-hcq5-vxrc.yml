  iana-time-zone vulnerable to use after free in MacOS / iOS implementation
  In iana-time-zone v0.1.43 a use-after-free bug in the MacOS / iOS implementation was introduced.

  The copied system time zone was released before its name was copied.
  If the system time zone was changed between the call of `CFRelease` and `str::to_owned()`,
  random memory would be copied.
