summary: |
  Jenkins Artifactory Plugin cross-site request forgery vulnerability
  Jenkins Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.
