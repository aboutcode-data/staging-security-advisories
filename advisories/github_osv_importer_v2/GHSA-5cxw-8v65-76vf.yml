aliases:
  - CVE-2021-21641
summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins promoted builds Plugin
  Jenkins promoted builds Plugin 3.9 and earlier does not require POST requests for HTTP endpoints implementing promotion (regular, forced, and re-execute), resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

  These vulnerabilities allow attackers to promote builds.

  Jenkins promoted builds Plugin 3.9.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

  A security hardening since Jenkins 2.287 and LTS 2.277.2 prevents exploitation of this vulnerability.
