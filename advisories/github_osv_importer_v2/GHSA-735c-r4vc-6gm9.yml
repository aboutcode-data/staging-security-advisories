  - CVE-2016-10613
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in bionode-sra\nAffected versions of `bionode-sra` insecurely\
  \ downloads resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network\
  \ position, they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity of impact\
  \ for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of the package\
  \ itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all the way up to and including\
  \ remote code execution.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this\
  \ vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a\
  \ different package if available. The author of this package has suggested using [urllib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urllib-sync).\n\
  \nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is\
  \ not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private\
  \ network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised\
  \ your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors\
  \ or Rogue ISP Employees."
