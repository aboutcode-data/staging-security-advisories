  Cross-Site Scripting in ngx-md
  Versions of `ngx-md` prior to 6.0.3 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.  Links are not properly restricted to http/https and can contain JavaScript which may lead to arbitrary code execution. Markdown input such as `[Click Me](javascript:alert('Injected!'%29)` is rendered as a `Click Me` link that executes JavaScript.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 6.0.3 or later.
