summary: |
  Snowflake JDBC uses insecure temporary credential cache file permissions
  ### Issue
  Snowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC Driver. On Linux systems, when temporary credential caching is enabled, the Snowflake JDBC Driver will cache temporary credentials locally in a world-readable file.

  This vulnerability affects versions 3.6.8 through 3.21.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.22.0.

  ### Vulnerability Details
  On Linux, when either EXTERNALBROWSER or USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA authentication methods are used with temporary credential caching enabled, the Snowflake JDBC Driver will cache temporary credentials in a local file. In the vulnerable versions of the Driver, this file is created with world-readable permissions.

  ### Solution
  Snowflake released version 3.22.0 of the Snowflake JDBC Driver, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade to version 3.22.0.
