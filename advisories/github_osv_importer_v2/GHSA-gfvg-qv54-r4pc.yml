summary: "n8n's Improper File Access Controls Allow Arbitrary File Read by Authenticated Users\n\
  ## Impact\n\nA vulnerability in the file access controls allows authenticated users with permission\
  \ to create or modify workflows to read sensitive files from the n8n host system. This can\
  \ be exploited to obtain critical configuration data and user credentials, leading to complete\
  \ account takeover of any user on the instance.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed\
  \ in n8n version 1.123.18 and 2.5.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later to remediate\
  \ the vulnerability.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators\
  \ should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n\n- Limit workflow creation and editing\
  \ permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Restrict access to nodes that interact with\
  \ the file system, particularly the \"Read/Write Files from Disk\" and \"Git\" nodes.\n\n\
  These workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation\
  \ measures.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [n8n Documentation — Blocking nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) —\
  \ how to globally disable specific nodes\n\n--- \nn8n has adopted CVSS 4.0 as primary score\
  \ for all security advisories. CVSS 3.1 vector strings are provided for backward compatibility.\n\
