  Cross-Site Scripting in google-closure-library
  Versions of `google-closure-library` prior to 20190301.0.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The `safedomtreeprocessor.processToString()` function improperly processed empty elements, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript through Mutation Cross-Site Scripting.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 20190301.0.0 or later.
