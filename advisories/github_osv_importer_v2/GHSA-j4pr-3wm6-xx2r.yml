  URI Credential Leakage Bypass over CVE-2025-27221
  ### Impact

  In affected URI version, a bypass exists for the fix to CVE-2025-27221 that can expose user credentials.

  When using the `+` operator to combine URIs, sensitive information like passwords from the original URI can be leaked, violating RFC3986 and making applications vulnerable to credential exposure.

  The vulnerability affects the `uri` gem bundled with the following Ruby series:

  * 0.12.4 and earlier (bundled in Ruby 3.2 series)
  * 0.13.2 and earlier (bundled in Ruby 3.3 series)
  * 1.0.3 and earlier (bundled in Ruby 3.4 series)

  ### Patches
