summary: |
  OpenFGA Authorization Bypass
  ### Overview
  OpenFGA v1.8.0 to v1.8.12 ( openfga-0.2.16 <= Helm chart <= openfga-0.2.31, v1.8.0 <= docker <= v.1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed.


  ### Am I Affected?
  If you are using OpenFGA v1.8.0 to v1.8.12, specifically under the following conditions, you are affected by this authorization bypass vulnerability:
  - Calling Check API or ListObjects with an [authorization model](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-an-authorization-model) that has a relationship directly assignable by both [type bound public access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access) and [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets), and
  - There are check or list object queries with [contextual tuples](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/contextual-tuples) for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both [type bound public access](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-type-bound-public-access) and [userset](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/building-blocks/usersets), and
  - Those contextual tuples’s user field is an userset, and
  - Type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship

  ### Fix
  Upgrade to v1.8.13. This upgrade is backwards compatible.

  ### Acknowledgments
  Okta would like to thank @udyvish for discovering this vulnerability.
