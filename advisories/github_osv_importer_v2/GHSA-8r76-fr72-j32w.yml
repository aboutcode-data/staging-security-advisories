  Creator Verification Error when Bubblegum Activate
  This was an error found by @metamania01 of the Audit Company Solshield.

  It allowed one to verify a creator that did not sign by making use of a provision in Token Metadata that allows Creators who have signed compressed nfts to allow them to decompress with verified creators.

  The issue is now patched.
