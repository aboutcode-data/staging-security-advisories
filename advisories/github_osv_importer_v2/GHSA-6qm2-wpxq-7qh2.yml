aliases:
  - CVE-2023-51449
summary: "Gradio makes the `/file` secure against file traversal and server-side request forgery\
  \ attacks\nOlder versions of `gradio` contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which\
  \ made them susceptible to file traversal attacks in which an attacker could access arbitrary\
  \ files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL (e.g. if the demo was created\
  \ with `share=True`, or on Hugging Face Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for.\
  \ \n\nThis was not possible through regular URLs passed into a browser, but it was possible\
  \ through the use of programmatic tools such as `curl` with the `--pass-as-is` flag. \n\n\
  Furthermore,  the `/file` route in Gradio apps also contained a vulnerability that made it\
  \ possible to use it for SSRF attacks.\n\nBoth of these vulnerabilities have been fixed in\
  \ `gradio==4.11.0`"
