  Cosmos EVM Vulnerability
  ## Patches
  Patched in versions `v0.3.1`, `v0.4.2`, and in the `v0.5.0` release. More information will be disclosed at a later point to ensure chains have time to safely upgrade.

  ## Workarounds
  No workarounds for chains that make use of static or dynamic precompiles. Upgrading is strongly recommended.

  ## Testing
  Tests are introduced in every affected version.

  ## Credits
  Special thanks to @yihuang for the help on this issue.
