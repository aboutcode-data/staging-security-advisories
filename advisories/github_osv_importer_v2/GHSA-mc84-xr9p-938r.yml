summary: |
  High severity vulnerability that affects generator-jhipster
  ## Generated code uses repository configuration that downloads over HTTP instead of HTTPS

  ### Impact
  Gradle users were using the http://repo.spring.io/plugins-release repositories in plain HTTP, and not HTTPS, so a man-in-the-middle attack was possible at build time.

  ### Patches

  Maven users should at least upgrade to 6.3.0 while Gradle users should update to 6.3.1.
  If you are not able to upgrade make sure not to use a Maven repository via `http` in your build file.

  ### Workarounds

  Replace all custom repository definitions in `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` with their `https` version.

  e.g.

  ```xml
   <repository>
              <id>oss.sonatype.org-snapshot</id>
              <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url> // <-- must be httpS
              <releases>
                  <enabled>false</enabled>
              </releases>
              <snapshots>
                  <enabled>true</enabled>
              </snapshots>
  </repository>
  ```

  ```gradle
  maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/plugins-release" } // <-- must be httpS
  ```
