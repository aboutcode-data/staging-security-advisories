  PhpSpreadsheet has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in custom properties
  # Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in custom properties

  **Product**: Phpspreadsheet
  **Version**: version 3.6.0
  **CWE-ID**: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
  **CVSS vector v.3.1**: 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
  **CVSS vector v.4.0**: 4.8 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N)
  **Description**: the HTML page is generated without clearing custom properties
  **Impact**: executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser
  **Vulnerable component**: class `PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html`, method `generateMeta`
  **Exploitation conditions**: a user viewing a specially generated Excel file
  **Mitigation**: additional sanitization of special characters in a string
  **Researcher**: Aleksey Solovev (Positive Technologies)

  # Research

  The researcher discovered zero-day vulnerability Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in custom properties in Phpspreadsheet.
  The following code is written on the server, which translates the XLSX file into a HTML representation and displays it in the response.

  *Listing 9. Source code on the server*

  ```
  <?php

  require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

  $inputFileName = './doc/Book1.xlsx';
  $spreadsheet = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::load($inputFileName);
  $writer = new \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html($spreadsheet);
  print($writer->generateHTMLAll());
  ```

  An attacker can embed a payload in a file property that will result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
  The Excel file is unpacked and a custom property in the file is inserted into the `docProps/custom.xml` file.

  *Figure 17. Embedding the payload*

  After making the changes, a new archive with the xlsx extension was created. At the moment of converting the xlsx file into an HTML representation, a property is obtained that participates in the formation of a string without sanitization.

  *Figure 18. Getting a custom property*

  When calling the static `generateMeta` method, you can see that the key of the custom property is displayed without sanitization.

  *Figure 19. Getting a custom property*

  As a result, when viewing the excel file as the HTML representation, arbitrary JavaScript code will be executed.
