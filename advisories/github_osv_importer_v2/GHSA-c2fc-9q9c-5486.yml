aliases:
  - CVE-2025-59350
summary: |
  Dragonfly vulnerable to timing attacks against Proxy’s basic authentication
  ### Impact
  The access control mechanism for the Proxy feature uses simple string comparisons and is therefore vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker may try to guess the password one character at a time by sending all possible characters to a vulnerable mechanism and measuring the comparison instruction’s execution times.
  The vulnerability is shown in figure 8.1, where both the username and password are compared with a short-circuiting equality operation.

  ```golang
  if user != proxy.basicAuth.Username || pass != proxy.basicAuth.Password {
  ```

  It is currently undetermined what an attacker may be able to do with access to the proxy password.

  ### Patches

  - Dragonfy v2.1.0 and above.

  ### Workarounds

  There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.
