summary: |
  Jupyter Server Proxy has a reflected XSS issue in host parameter
  ### Impact

  There is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in `jupyter-server-proxy`[1]. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor.
  As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. This issue exists in the latest release of `jupyter-server-proxy`, currently `v4.1.2`.
  **Impacted versions:** `>=3.0.0,<=4.1.2`

  ### Patches

  The patches are included in `==4.2.0` and `==3.2.4`.

  ### Workarounds

  Server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension with:

  ```
  jupyter server extension disable jupyter-server-proxy
  ```
