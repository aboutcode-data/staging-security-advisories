summary: |
  TorchServe gRPC Port Exposure
  ### Impact
  The two gRPC ports 7070 and 7071, are not bound to [localhost](http://localhost/) by default, so when TorchServe is launched, these two interfaces are bound to all interfaces. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected.

  ### Patches
  This issue in TorchServe has been fixed in [#3083](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3083).

  TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability.
