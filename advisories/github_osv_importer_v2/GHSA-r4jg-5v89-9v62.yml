  Withdrawn: Octocat.js vulnerable to code injection
  ## Withdrawn

  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a test.

  ## Original Description

  ### Impact
  Users can include their own images for accessories via provided URLs. These URLs are not validated and can result in execution of injected code.

  ### Patches
  This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2 of octocat.js

  ### Workarounds
  Directly exposing rendered images to a website can introduce the vulnerability to users. To avoid, writing an image to disk then using that image in an image element in HTML mitigates the risk.
