summary: "Local directory executable lookup in sops (Windows-only)\n### Impact\nWindows users\
  \ using the sops direct editor option (`sops file.yaml`) can have a local executable named\
  \ either `vi`, `vim`, or `nano` executed if running sops from `cmd.exe`\n\nThis attack is\
  \ only viable if an attacker is able to place a malicious binary within the directory you\
  \ are running sops from. As well, this attack will only work when using `cmd.exe` or the Windows\
  \ C library [SearchPath function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processenv/nf-processenv-searchpatha).\
  \ This is a result of these Windows tools including `.` within their `PATH` by default.\n\n\
  **If you are using sops within untrusted directories on Windows via `cmd.exe`, please upgrade\
  \ immediately** \n\n**As well, if you have `.` within your default $PATH, please upgrade immediately.**\n\
  \nMore information can be found on the official Go blog: https://blog.golang.org/path-security\n\
  \n### Patches\nThe problem has been resolved in v3.7.1\n\nNow, if Windows users using cmd.exe\
  \ run into this issue, a warning message will be printed:\n`vim resolves to executable in\
  \ current directory (.\\vim.exe)`\n\n### References\n* https://blog.golang.org/path-security\n\
