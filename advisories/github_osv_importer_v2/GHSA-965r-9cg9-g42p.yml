aliases:
  - CVE-2025-48881
summary: |
  Valtimo backend libraries allows objects in the object-api to be accessed and modified by unauthorized users
  ### Impact
  All objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users.

  If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations.

  ### Attack requirements
  The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack:
  - A user must be logged in
    - No relevant application roles are required
  - At least one object-type must be configured via object-management
    - The scope of the attack is limited to objects that are configured via object-management.
    - The value of `showInDataMenu` is irrelevant for this attack

  ### Patches
  This issue was patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.

  ### Workarounds
  It is possible to override the endpoint security as defined in `ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer` and `ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer`. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.
