  - CVE-2020-36448
summary: "Data races in cache\nAn issue was discovered in the cache crate through 2020-11-24\
  \ for Rust. \nAffected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `Cache<K>`.\n\
  This allows users to insert `K` that is not Send or not Sync.\n\nThis allows users to create\
  \ data races by using non-Send types like `Arc<Cell<T>>` or `Rc<T>` as `K` in `Cache<K>`.\
  \ It is also possible to create data races by using types like `Cell<T>` or `RefCell<T>` (types\
  \ that are `Send` but not `Sync`).\nSuch data races can lead to memory corruption."
