summary: "OpenH264 Rust API Openh264 Decoding Functions Heap Overflow Vulnerability\nOpenH264\
  \ recently reported a [heap overflow](https://github.com/cisco/openh264/security/advisories/GHSA-m99q-5j7x-7m9x)\
  \ that was fixed in upstream [63db555](https://github.com/cisco/openh264/commit/63db555e30986e3a5f07871368dc90ae78c27449)\
  \ and [integrated into](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/openh264-rs/commit/3a822fff0b4c9a984622ca2b179fe8898ac54b14)\
  \ our 0.6.6 release. For users relying on Cisco's pre-compiled DLL, we also published 0.8.0,\
  \ which is compatible with their latest fixed DLL version  2.6.0. \n\nIn other words:\n- if\
  \ you rely on our `source` feature only, >=0.6.6 should be safe,\n- if you rely on `libloading`,\
  \ you must upgrade to 0.8.0 _and_ use their latest DLL >=2.6.0. \n\nUsers handling untrusted\
  \ video files should update immediately."
