summary: |
  EVE Doesn't Measure Config Partition From 2 Fronts
  ### Impact
  PCR14 is not included in the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the vault key. Additionally, the vault key uses SHA1 PCRs instead of SHA256.
  Thus an attacker with physical access can take out the disk, use a different computer to modify the files in the /config partition, and re-insert the disk and boot without the change being detected by measured boot and remote attestation.

  ### Patches

  Fixed in EVE version 9.4.3-lts

  ### Workarounds

  None (apart from preventing physical access to the device)
