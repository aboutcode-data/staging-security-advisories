  eZ Platform User data disclosure
  In eZ Platform v2.3.x it is possible to bypass permission checks in a particular case. This means user data such as name and email (but not passwords or password hashes) can be read by unauthenticated users. This affects only v2.3.x. If you use v2.2.x or older you are not affected.

  To install, use Composer to update "ezsystems/repository-forms" to the "Resolving versions" mentioned above, or apply this patch manually:
  https://github.com/ezsystems/repository-forms/commit/ea82e136ec1ea40aca714abb79cc8e5bfece01e8
