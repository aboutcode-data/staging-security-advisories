summary: "PQClean has a correctness error in HQC decapsulation\n### Impact\n\nA correctness\
  \ error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism.\
  \ Due to an indexing error, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data.\
  \ This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function\
  \ is called with a malformed ciphertext.\n\nNo concrete attack exploiting the error has been\
  \ identified at this point. However, the error involves mishandling of the secret key, and\
  \ in principle this presents a security vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nPQClean does not\
  \ have a release process, as it is a collection of implementations. If you obtained a HQC\
  \ implementation from PQClean, please update to a version that includes the fixes proposed\
  \ in https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578. \n\nPlease also [refer to our security policy](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nManually patching is always possible\n\n### Further details\n\nIn the\
  \ 2023/04/30 version of the HQC specification and reference implementation, an extra field\
  \ (sigma) was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed\
  \ ciphertexts. The logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation\
  \ function was not updated accordingly. As a result, sigma is treated as part of the public\
  \ key. Later in the decapsulation call, a incorrectly constructed comparison check allows\
  \ this error to go through undetected. Due to how these two bugs interfere with each other,\
  \ the decapsulation function never uses sigma to perform implicit rejection; instead, it accepts\
  \ malformed ciphertexts and returns shared secrets based on their decryptions.\n\n### References\n\
  \nThis issue was first reported in OQS https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7.\
  \ The vulnerability was identified by Célian Glénaz and Dahmun Goudarzi (Quarkslab)."
