summary: "Apollo Router Query Validation Vulnerable to Excessive Resource Consumption via Named\
  \ Fragment Processing\n# Impact\n\n## Summary\n\nA vulnerability in Apollo Router's usage\
  \ of Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively\
  \ expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.\n\
  \n## Details\n\nNamed fragments were being processed once per fragment spread in some cases\
  \ during query validation, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused\
  \ fragments were involved.\n\n## Fix/Mitigation\n\nApollo Router's usage of Apollo Compiler\
  \ has been updated so that validation logic processes each named fragment only once, preventing\
  \ redundant traversal.\n\n# Patches\n\nThis has been remediated in `apollo-router` versions\
  \ 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.\n\n# Workarounds\nThe only known workaround is \"Safelisting with IDs\
  \ only\" per [Safelisting with Persisted Queries - Apollo GraphQL Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#router-security-levels).\
  \ The \"Safelisting\" security level is not sufficient, since that level allows freeform GraphQL\
  \ queries to be sent to Apollo Router.\n\n# References \n[Query Planning Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans)\n\
  \n## Acknowledgements\nWe appreciate the efforts of the security community in identifying\
  \ and improving the performance and security of query validation mechanisms."
