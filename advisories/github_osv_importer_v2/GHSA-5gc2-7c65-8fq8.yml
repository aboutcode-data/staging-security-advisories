summary: |
  async-graphql Directive Overload
  ### Impact

  - Service Disruption: The server may become unresponsive or extremely slow, potentially leading to downtime.
  - Resource Exhaustion: Excessive use of server resources, such as CPU and memory, could negatively impact other services running on the same infrastructure.
  - User Experience Degradation: Users may experience delays or failures when accessing the service, which could lead to frustration and loss of trust in the service.

  ### Patches

  1. Upgrade to v7.0.10
  2. Use [SchemaBuilder.limit_directives](https://docs.rs/async-graphql/latest/async_graphql/struct.SchemaBuilder.html#method.limit_directives) to limit the maximum number of directives for a single field.
