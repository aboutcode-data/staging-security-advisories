summary: |
  virtualenv Has TOCTOU Vulnerabilities in Directory Creation
  ## Impact

  TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) vulnerabilities in `virtualenv` allow local attackers to perform symlink-based attacks on directory creation operations. An attacker with local access can exploit a race condition between directory existence checks and creation to redirect virtualenv's app_data and lock file operations to attacker-controlled locations.

  **Affected versions:** All versions up to and including 20.36.1

  **Affected users:** Any user running `virtualenv` on multi-user systems where untrusted local users have filesystem access to shared temporary directories or where `VIRTUALENV_OVERRIDE_APP_DATA` points to a user-writable location.

  **Attack scenarios:**
  - Cache poisoning: Attacker corrupts wheels or Python metadata in the cache
  - Information disclosure: Attacker reads sensitive cached data or metadata
  - Lock bypass: Attacker controls lock file semantics to cause concurrent access violations
  - Denial of service: Lock starvation preventing virtualenv operations

  ## Patches

  The vulnerability has been patched by replacing check-then-act patterns with atomic `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` operations.

  **Fixed in:** PR #3013

  **Versions with the fix:** 20.36.2 and later

  Users should upgrade to version 20.36.2 or later.

  ## Workarounds

  If you cannot upgrade immediately:

  1. Ensure `VIRTUALENV_OVERRIDE_APP_DATA` points to a directory owned by the current user with restricted permissions (mode 0700)
  2. Avoid running `virtualenv` in shared temporary directories where other users have write access
  3. Use separate user accounts for different projects to isolate app_data directories
