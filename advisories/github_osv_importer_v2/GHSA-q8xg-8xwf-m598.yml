  - CVE-2020-10800
summary: |
  Machine-In-The-Middle in lix
  All versions of `lix` are vulnerable to Machine-In-The-Middle. The package accepts downloads with `http` and follows `location` header redirects for package downloads. This allows for an attacker in a privileged network position to intercept a lix package installation and redirect the download to a malicious source.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
