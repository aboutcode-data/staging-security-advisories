  - CVE-2025-47285
summary: |
  Vyper's `concat()` builtin may elide side-effects for zero-length arguments
  ### Impact
  `concat()` may skip evaluation of side effects when the length of an argument is zero. this is due to a fastpath in the implementation which skips evaluation of argument expressions when their length is zero:
  https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/68b68c4b30c5ef2f312b4674676170b8a6eaa316/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L560-L562

  in practice, it would be very unusual in user code to construct zero-length bytestrings using an expression with side-effects, since zero-length bytestrings are typically constructed with the empty literal `b""`; the only way to construct an empty bytestring which has side effects would be with the ternary operator introduced in v0.3.8, e.g. `b"" if self.do_some_side_effect() else b""`.

  the following example demonstrates how the issue would look in user code
  ```vyper
  counter: public(uint256)

  @external
  def test() -> Bytes[256]:
      a: Bytes[256] = concat(b"" if self.sideeffect() else b"", b"aaaa")
      return a

  def sideeffect() -> bool:
      self.counter += 1
      return True
  ```

  the severity assigned is low, since, as mentioned, this would be a very unusual pattern in user-code.

  ### Patches

  fix is tracked in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/4644

  ### Workarounds
  don't have side effects in expressions which construct zero-length bytestrings.
