summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in unicode\nAffected versions of `unicode` insecurely\
  \ download resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network\
  \ position, they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity of impact\
  \ for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of the package\
  \ itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all the way up to and including\
  \ remote code execution.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 9.0.0 or later."
