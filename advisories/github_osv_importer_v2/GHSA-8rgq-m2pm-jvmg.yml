  Duplicate Advisory: gix-date can create non-utf8 string with `TimeBuf::as_str`
  ### Duplicate Advisory

  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6mw6-mj76-grwc. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ### Original Description
  A flaw was found in gix-date. The `gix_date::parse::TimeBuf::as_str` function can generate strings containing invalid non-UTF8 characters. This issue violates the internal safety invariants of the `TimeBuf` component, leading to undefined behavior when these malformed strings are subsequently processed. This could potentially result in application instability or other unforeseen consequences.
