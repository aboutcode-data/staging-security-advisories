summary: "@fastify/secure-session: Reuse of destroyed secure session cookie\n### Impact\n\n\
  At the end of the request handling, it will encrypt all data in the session with a secret\
  \ key and attach the ciphertext as a cookie value with the defined cookie name. After that,\
  \ the session on the server side is destroyed. When an encrypted cookie with matching session\
  \ name is provided with subsequent requests, it will decrypt the ciphertext to get the data.\
  \ The plugin then creates a new session with the data in the ciphertext. Thus theoretically\
  \ the web instance is still accessing the data from a server-side session, but technically\
  \ that session is generated solely from a user provided cookie (which is assumed to be non-craftable\
  \ because it is encrypted with a secret key not known to the user).\n\nThe issue exists in\
  \ the session removal process. In the delete function of the code, when the session is deleted,\
  \ it is marked for deletion. However, if an attacker could gain access to the cookie, they\
  \ could keep using it forever.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in 56d66642ecc633cff0606927601e81cdac361370.\n\
  Update to v7.3.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInclude a \"last update\" field in the session, and\
  \ treat \"old sessions\" as expired. \nMake sure to configure your cookie as \"http only\"\
  .\n\n### References\n\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/2374253"
