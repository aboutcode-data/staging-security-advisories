aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41273
summary: |
  Cross-Site Request Forgery allowing sending of test emails and generation of node auto-deployment keys
  ### Impact
  Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints:

  * Sending a test email.
  * Generating a node auto-deployment token.

  At no point would any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly in the system.

  ### Patches
  This has been addressed in https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/bf9cbe2c6d5266c6914223e067c56175de7fc3a5 which will be released as `1.6.6`.

  ### Workarounds
  Users may optionally manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems.
