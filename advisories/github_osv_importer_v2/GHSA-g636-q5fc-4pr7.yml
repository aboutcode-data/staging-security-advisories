  accounts: Hash account number using Salt
  @alovak found that currently when we build hash of account number we do not "salt" it. Which makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attack.

  **What did you expect to see?**
  I expected salt (some random number from configuration) to be used in [hash.AccountNumber](https://github.com/moov-io/customers/blob/master/pkg/secrets/hash/account_number.go#L13)

  I would generate salt per tenant at least (maybe per organization).
