summary: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE Doesn't Measure Config Partition From 2 Fronts\n### Duplicate\
  \ Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-phcg-h58r-gmcq.\
  \ This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nPCR14\
  \ is not in the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the “vault” key, but\ndue to the change that\
  \ was implemented in commit\n“7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4”, fixing this issue\
  \ alone would not solve the\nproblem of the config partition not being measured correctly.\n\
  \nAlso, the “vault” key is sealed/unsealed with SHA1 PCRs instead of\nSHA256. \nThis issue\
  \ was somewhat mitigated due to all of the PCR extend functions\nupdating both the values\
  \ of SHA256 and SHA1 for a given PCR ID.\n\nHowever, due to the change that was implemented\
  \ in commit\n“7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4”, this is no longer the case for PCR14,\
  \ as\nthe code in “measurefs.go” explicitly updates only the SHA256 instance of PCR14, which\n\
  means that even if PCR14 were to be added to the list of PCRs sealing/unsealing the “vault”\n\
  key, changes to the config partition would still not be measured.\n\n\n\nAn attacker could\
  \ modify the config partition without triggering the measured boot, this could\nresult in\
  \ the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to the contents of the\n\
  encrypted “vault”"
