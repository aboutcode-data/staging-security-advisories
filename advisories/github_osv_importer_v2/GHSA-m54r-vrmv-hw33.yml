  - CVE-2020-15186
summary: |
  Improper Sanitizing of plugin names in helm
  ### Impact

  Security researchers at Trail of Bits discovered that plugin names are not sanitized properly. As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another plugin or spoofing the output to `helm --help`.

  ### Specific Go Packages Affected
  helm.sh/helm/v3/pkg/plugin

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2.

  ### Workarounds

  Do not install untrusted Helm plugins. Examine the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range.
