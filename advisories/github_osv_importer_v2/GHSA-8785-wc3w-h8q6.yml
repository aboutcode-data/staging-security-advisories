summary: |
  OpenTelemetry .NET has Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in API Package
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  A vulnerability in `OpenTelemetry.Api` package `1.10.0` to `1.11.1` could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when a `tracestate` and `traceparent` header is received.

  * Even if an application does not explicitly use trace context propagation, receiving these headers can still trigger high CPU usage.
  * This issue impacts any application accessible over the web or backend services that process HTTP requests containing a `tracestate` header.
  * Application may experience excessive resource consumption, leading to increased latency, degraded performance, or downtime.
