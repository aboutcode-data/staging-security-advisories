  Hardcoded Initialization Vector in parsel
  All versions of `parsel` have a default hardcoded initialization vector. In cases where the IV is not provided, the package defaults to a hardcoded IV which renders the cipher vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks.


  ## Recommendation

  The package is deprecated and will not be updated. Consider using an alternative package.
