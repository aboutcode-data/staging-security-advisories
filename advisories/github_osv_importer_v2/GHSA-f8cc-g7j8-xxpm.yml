aliases:
  - CVE-2022-40151
summary: |
  XStream can cause a Denial of Service by injecting deeply nested objects raising a stack overflow
  ### Impact
  The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream.

  ### Patches
  XStream 1.4.20 handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead.

  ### Workarounds
  The only solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.
