  rPGP's integrity protection of encrypted data was not always checked
  ### Summary
  For some messages, rPGP returned incorrectly decrypted data without signaling that integrity protection was invalid.

  ### Details
  When decrypting SEIPD (Symmetrically Encrypted and Integrity Protected Data Packet), rPGP previously did not under all circumstances report the absence of valid integrity protection to callers of the library.

  ### Impact
  While the resulting invalid decryption output is not attacker controlled, its contents may be a security concern if an attacker can gain access to it.

  ### Attribution
  Discovered internally in the course of rPGP development work.
