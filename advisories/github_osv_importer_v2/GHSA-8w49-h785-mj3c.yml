  - CVE-2024-52804
summary: |
  Tornado has an HTTP cookie parsing DoS vulnerability
  The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests.

  See also CVE-2024-7592 for a similar vulnerability in cpython.
