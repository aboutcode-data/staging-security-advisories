  - CVE-2020-15087
summary: "Privilege escalation in Presto\n### Affected\nThis affects Presto server installations.\
  \ This does NOT affect clients such as the CLI or JDBC driver.\n\n### Impact\nAuthenticated\
  \ users can bypass authorization checks by directly accessing internal APIs. This impacts\
  \ Presto server installations with secure internal communication configured.\n\nThis does\
  \ not affect installations that have not configured secure internal communication, as these\
  \ installations are inherently insecure.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed starting\
  \ with PrestoSQL version 337.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis issue can be mitigated by blocking\
  \ network access to internal APIs on the coordinator and workers. \n\n### References\nSee\
  \ the Presto documentation for [Secure Internal Communication](https://trino.io/docs/current/security/internal-communication.html).\n\
  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*\
