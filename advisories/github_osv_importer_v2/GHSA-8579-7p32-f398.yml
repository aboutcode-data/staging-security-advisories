summary: "CubeFS timing attack can leak user passwords\nA vulnerability was found during in\
  \ the CubeFS master component that could allow an untrusted attacker to steal user passwords\
  \ by carrying out a timing attack. The root case of the vulnerability was that CubeFS used\
  \ raw string comparison of passwords.\n\nThe vulnerable part of CubeFS was the UserService\
  \ of the master component. The UserService gets instantiated when starting the server of the\
  \ master component. \n\nCubeFS has not seen any evidence of this being exploited in the wild.\
  \ The vulnerability was found during a security audit conducted by [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/)\
  \ in collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).\n\
  \nThe issue has been patched in v3.3.1. For impacted users, there is no other way to mitigate\
  \ the issue besides upgrading."
