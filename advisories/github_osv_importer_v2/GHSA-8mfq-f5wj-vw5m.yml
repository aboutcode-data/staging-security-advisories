summary: "Nautobot vulnerable to remote code execution via Jinja2 template rendering\n### Impact\n\
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nAll users of Nautobot versions earlier\
  \ than 1.5.7 are impacted.\n\nIn Nautobot 1.5.7 we have enabled sandboxed environments for\
  \ the Jinja2 template engine used internally for template rendering for the following objects:\n\
  \n- `extras.ComputedField`\n- `extras.CustomLink`\n- `extras.ExportTemplate` \n- `extras.Secret`\n\
  - `extras.Webhook`\n\nWhile we are not aware of any active exploits, we have made this change\
  \ as a preventative measure to protect against any potential remote code execution attacks\
  \ utilizing maliciously crafted template code.\n\nThis change forces the Jinja2 template engine\
  \ to use a [`SandboxedEnvironment`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/sandbox/#sandbox)\
  \ on all new installations of Nautobot.\n\nThis addresses any potential unsafe code execution\
  \ everywhere the helper function `nautobot.utilities.utils.render_jinja2` is called. Additionally,\
  \ our documentation that was previously suggesting the direct use of `jinja2.Template` has\
  \ been revised to utilize `render_jinja2`.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?\
  \ What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes. Users should upgrade to Nautobot 1.5.7 or\
  \ newer.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability\
  \ without upgrading?_\n\n##### Enabling Sandboxed Environments\n\nFor users that are unable\
  \ to upgrade to the latest release of Nautobot, you may add the following setting to your\
  \ `nautobot_config.py` to apply the sandbox environment enforcement:\n\n```python\nTEMPLATES[1][\"\
  OPTIONS\"][\"environment\"] = \"jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment\"\n```\n\nAfter applying\
  \ this change, you must restart all Nautobot services, including any Celery worker processes.\n\
  \n**Note:** *Nautobot specifies two template engines by default, the first being “django”\
  \ for the Django built-in template engine, and the second being “jinja” for the Jinja2 template\
  \ engine. This recommended setting will update the second item in the list of template engines,\
  \ which is the Jinja2 engine.*\n\n##### Restricting Jinja2 using Access Controls\n\nFor users\
  \ that are unable to immediately update their configuration such as if a Nautobot service\
  \ restart is too disruptive to operations, access to provide custom Jinja2 template values\
  \ may be mitigated using permissions to restrict “change” (write) actions to the affected\
  \ object types listed in the first section.\n\n**Note:** *This solution is intended to be\
  \ stopgap until you can successfully update your `nautobot_config.py` or upgrade your Nautobot\
  \ instance to apply the sandboxed environment enforcement.*\n\n#### Updating Existing App\
  \ or Job Code\n\nFor Nautobot App (formerly plugin) authors or Job authors, additionally we\
  \ recommend that if you have any custom code that may for example be using `jinaj2.Template`\
  \ that you no longer use that. Instead, please always use our `nautobot.utilities.utils.render_jinja2`\
  \ function which will make sure that the centrally-provided Jinja2 template engine with sandboxing\
  \ enforced is being utilized.\n\nAnywhere you’ve been using this pattern:\n\n```python\nfrom\
  \ jinja2 import Template\n\nmy_template = Template(template_code)\nconfig = my_template.render(context)\n\
  ```\n\nWe recommend that you replace it with this pattern:\n\n```python\nfrom nautobot.utilities.utils\
  \ import render_jinja2\n    \nconfig = render_jinja2(template_code, context)\n```\n\n### References\n\
  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nPlease see the Nautobot 1.5.7 release\
  \ notes. \n\nhttps://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/release-notes/version-1.5/#v157-2023-01-04"
