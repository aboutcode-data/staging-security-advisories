summary: |
  containerd CRI plugin: Incorrect cgroup hierarchy assignment for containers running in usernamespaced Kubernetes pods.
  # Impact

  A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where containerd doesn't put usernamespaced containers under the Kubernetes' cgroup hierarchy, therefore some Kubernetes limits are not honored. This may cause a denial of service of the Kubernetes node.

  # Patches

  This bug has been fixed in containerd 2.0.5+ and 2.1.0+. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

  # Workarounds

  Disable usernamespaced pods in Kubernetes temporarily.

  # Credits

  The containerd project would like to thank Rodrigo Campos Catelin and Piotr Rogowski for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
