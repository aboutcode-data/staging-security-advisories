summary: |
  Weaviate OSS has path traversal vulnerability via the Shard Movement API
  An issue was discovered in Weaviate OSS before 1.33.4. Due to a lack of validation of the fileName field in the transfer logic, an attacker who can call the GetFile method while a shard is in the "Pause file activity" state and the FileReplicationService is reachable can read arbitrary files accessible to the service process.
