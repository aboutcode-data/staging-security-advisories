summary: "SixLabors.ImageSharp vulnerable to Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n###\
  \ Impact\n\nA vulnerability discovered in the ImageSharp library, where the processing of\
  \ specially crafted files can lead to excessive memory usage in image decoders. The vulnerability\
  \ is triggered when ImageSharp attempts to process image files that are designed to exploit\
  \ this flaw. \n\nThis flaw can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting\
  \ process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on ImageSharp for\
  \ image processing tasks. Users and administrators are advised to update to the latest version\
  \ of ImageSharp that addresses this vulnerability to mitigate the risk of exploitation.\n\n\
  ### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched. All users are advised to upgrade to v3.1.4 or\
  \ v2.1.8.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBefore calling `Image.Decode(Async)`, use `Image.Identify`\
  \ to determine the image dimensions in order to enforce a limit.\n\n### References\n\n- ImageSharp:\
