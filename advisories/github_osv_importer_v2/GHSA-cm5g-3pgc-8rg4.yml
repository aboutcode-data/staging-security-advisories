summary: |
  Express ressource injection
  A vulnerability has been identified in the Express response.links function, allowing for arbitrary resource injection in the Link header when unsanitized data is used.

  The issue arises from improper sanitization in `Link` header values, which can allow a combination of characters like `,`, `;`, and `<>` to preload malicious resources.

  This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.
