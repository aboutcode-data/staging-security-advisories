summary: |
  phpMyFAQ has Stored XSS in user list via admin-managed display_name
  ### Summary
  A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in an administrator’s browser by registering a user whose **display name** contains HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;img ...&gt;`). When an administrator views the admin user list, the payload is decoded server-side and rendered without escaping, resulting in script execution in the admin context.

  ### Details
  Root cause is the following chain:
  - **User-controlled input stored**: attacker-provided `display_name` (real name) is stored in DB (often as HTML entities, e.g., `&lt;img ...&gt;`).
  - **Decode on read**: `phpmyfaq/src/phpMyFAQ/User/UserData.php` decodes `display_name` using `html_entity_decode(...)` (“for backward compatibility”).
  - **Unsafe sink**: admin user list renders the decoded value unescaped using Twig `|raw`:
    - `phpmyfaq/assets/templates/admin/user/users.twig` (users table uses `{{ user.display_name|raw }}`)

  As a result, an entity-encoded payload becomes active HTML/JS when rendered in the admin user list.

  Note: This report is about the `display_name` field + entity-decoding path. It is distinct from previously published issues focused on the `email` field.

  ### PoC (minimal reproduction)
  **Preconditions / configuration**
  - Registration enabled (`security.enableRegistration = true`).
  - Attacker does not need admin privileges.
  - Admin must view the admin user list page.

  **Steps**
  1. As an unauthenticated user, open the registration page and create a new account.
  2. Set the **display name / real name** field to the following entity-encoded payload:
     - `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;`
  3. Complete registration.
  4. As an administrator, open the admin user list (example):
     - `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/user/list`
  5. Observe JavaScript execution in the admin’s browser (e.g., `alert(1)` triggers) and the payload is rendered as an actual `<img>` element.

  ### Impact
  Stored XSS in the admin context can enable:
  - admin session compromise (depending on cookie flags),
  - CSRF token exfiltration and privileged admin actions,
  - UI redress/phishing within the admin panel.

  ### Evidence (what I observed)
  - Stored DB value (entities):
    `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;`
  - Rendered HTML in admin user list:
    `<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">`

  ### Affected versions
  **Confirmed by code inspection**
  - 4.0.14
  - 4.0.15
    - Both contain `html_entity_decode` for `display_name` in `UserData.php` and `{{ user.display_name|raw }}` in `users.twig`.

  **Confirmed by live reproduction**
  - 4.1.0-RC (tested on current source checkout)

  ### Environment (tested)
  - Host OS: macOS 15.6.1 (24G90)
  - Web container OS: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
  - PHP: 8.4.5RC1
  - DB: MariaDB 11.6.2
  - phpMyFAQ source commit (tested): bca1c4192c2ad61a3595b4289d9551a51e0e9848
