summary: "Unsound usages of `std::slice::from_raw_parts`\nThe library breaks the safety assumptions\
  \ when using unsafe API `std::slice::from_raw_parts`. First, when using the API in iterator\
  \ implementation (`TempFdArrayIterator.next`), generic type could be any type, which would\
  \ create and pass a misaligned pointer to the unsafe API. Second, when validating the address,\
  \ the code passed the type `c_void`, which could also be any type, leading to potential uninitialized\
  \ memory exposure.  \n\nTwo unsound usages here highlight the necessity for developers to\
  \ perform type checks before doing type conversion with unsafe API.  \n\nThe panic caused\
  \ by the misalignment causes several downstream applications (e.g., `greptimedb`) to crash\
  \ when using `pprof::report::ReportBuilder::build`.  \n\nThis was patched in 0.14.0.  \n\n\
  The developer also suggested moving to [pprof2](https://crates.io/crates/pprof2)."
