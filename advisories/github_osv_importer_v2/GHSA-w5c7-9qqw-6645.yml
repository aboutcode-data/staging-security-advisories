  OpenClaw inter-session prompts could be treated as direct user instructions
  ## Summary

  Inter-session messages sent via `sessions_send` could be interpreted as direct end-user instructions because they were persisted as `role: "user"` without provenance metadata.

  ## Affected Packages / Versions

  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.12` (i.e. `< 2026.2.13`)
  - Fixed in: `2026.2.13` (patched versions `>= 2026.2.13`)

  ## Impact

  A delegated or internal session could inject instructions into another session that appeared equivalent to externally-originated user input.

  This is an instruction-provenance confusion issue (confused-deputy style), which can lead to unintended privileged behavior in workflows that trust `role: "user"` as a sole authority signal.

  ## Technical details

  Before the fix, routed inter-session prompts were stored as regular user turns without a verifiable source marker.

  As a result, downstream workers and transcript readers could not distinguish:
  - External user input
  - Internal inter-session routed input

  ## Fix

  OpenClaw now carries explicit input provenance end-to-end for routed prompts.

  Key changes:
  - Added structured provenance model (`inputProvenance`) with `kind` values including `inter_session`.
  - `sessions_send` and agent-to-agent steps now set inter-session provenance when invoking target runs.
  - Provenance is persisted on user messages as `message.provenance.kind = "inter_session"` (role remains `user` for provider compatibility).
  - Transcript readers and memory helpers were updated to respect provenance and avoid treating inter-session prompts as external user-originated input.
  - Runtime context rebuilding now annotates inter-session turns with an explicit in-memory marker (`[Inter-session message]`) for clearer model-side disambiguation.
  - Regression tests were added for transcript parsing, session tools flow, runner sanitization, and memory hook behavior.

  ## Fix Commit(s)

  - `85409e401b6586f83954cb53552395d7aab04797`

  ## Workarounds

  If immediate upgrade is not possible:
  - Disable or restrict `sessions_send` in affected environments.
  - Do not use role alone as an authority boundary; require provenance-aware checks in orchestration logic.
