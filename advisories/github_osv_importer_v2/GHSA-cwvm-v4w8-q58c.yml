summary: |
  GitPython blind local file inclusion
  ### Summary

  In order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git` directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided by the user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is located outside the `.git` directory. This allows an attacker to make GitPython read any file from the system.

  ### Details

  This vulnerability is present in

  https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175

  That code joins the base directory with a user given string without checking if the final path is located outside the base directory.

  I was able to exploit it from three places, but there may be more code paths that lead to it:

  https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L605

  https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L620

  https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/index/base.py#L1353

  ### PoC

  Running GitPython within any repo should work, here is an example with the GitPython repo.

  ```python
  import git

  r = git.Repo(".")

  # This will make GitPython read the README.md file from the root of the repo
  r.commit("../README.md")
  r.tree("../README.md")
  r.index.diff("../README.md")

  # Reading /etc/random
  # WARNING: this will probably halt your system, run with caution
  # r.commit("../../../../../../../../../dev/random")
  ```

  ### Impact

  I wasn't able to show the contents of the files (that's why "blind" local file inclusion), depending on how GitPython is being used, this can be used by an attacker for something _inoffensive_ as checking if a file exits, or cause a DoS by making GitPython read a big/infinite file (like `/dev/random` on Linux systems).

  ### Possible solutions

  A solution would be to check that the final path isn't located outside the `repodir` path (maybe even after resolving symlinks). Maybe there could be other checks in place to make sure that the reference names are valid.
