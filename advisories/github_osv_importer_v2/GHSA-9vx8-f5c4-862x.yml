summary: "XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in apoc.import.graphml\n### Impact\nA XML\
  \ External Entity (XXE) vulnerability found in the apoc.import.graphml procedure of APOC core\
  \ plugin in Neo4j graph database. XML External Entity (XXE) injection occurs when the XML\
  \ parser allows external entities to be resolved. The XML parser used by the apoc.import.graphml\
  \ procedure was not configured in a secure way and therefore allowed this.\n\nExternal entities\
  \ can be used to read local files, send HTTP requests, and perform denial-of-service attacks\
  \ on the application.\n\nAbusing the XXE vulnerability enabled assessors to read local files\
  \ remotely. Although with the level of privileges assessors had this was limited to one-line\
  \ files. With the ability to write to the database, any file could have been read. Additionally,\
  \ assessors noted, with local testing, the server could be crashed by passing in improperly\
  \ formatted XML. \n\n### Patches\nThe users should aim to use the latest released version\
  \ compatible with their Neo4j version. The minimum versions containing patch for this vulnerability\
  \ is 4.4.0.14. \n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the [allowlist](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.security.procedures.allowlist)\
  \  of the  procedures that can be used in your system.\n\n### For more information\nIf you\
  \ have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [neo4j-apoc-procedures](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures)\n\

  \ recognise the contribution of Christopher Schneider – State Farm."
