  - CVE-2025-2886
summary: |
  tough terminating targets role delegations are not respected
  ## Summary

  Delegations are a mechanism defined by the TUF specification that allow multiple different identities to provide and sign content within a single repository. Terminating delegations and delegation priority give a TUF repository unambiguous control over how overlapping delegations are resolved. tough erroneously will not terminate a search as required, and will accept information from a lower-priority delegation that should have been ignored.

  ## Impact

  When interacting with TUF repositories that use delegations, the tough client could fetch targets owned by the incorrect role. An actor which had delegated ownership of a subset of a TUF repository could provide arbitrary contents to tough clients for targets owned by the delegating identity.

  Impacted versions: < v0.20.0

  ## Patches

  A fix for this issue is available in tough version 0.20.0 and later. Customers are advised to upgrade to version 0.20.0 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.

  ## Workarounds

  There is no recommended work around. Customers are advised to upgrade to version 0.20.0 or the latest version.
