summary: |
  Path traversal vulnerability on Windows in Jenkins
  The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `userContent/` in Jenkins 2.314 and earlier, LTS 2.303.1 and earlier may interpret some paths to files as absolute on Windows.

  This results in a path traversal vulnerability allowing attackers with Overall/Read permission (Windows controller) or Job/Workspace permission (Windows agents) to obtain the contents of arbitrary files.\n\nThe file browser in Jenkins 2.315, LTS 2.303.2 refuses to serve files that would be considered absolute paths.
