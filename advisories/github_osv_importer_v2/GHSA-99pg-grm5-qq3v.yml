summary: |
  Docker CLI leaks private registry credentials to registry-1.docker.io
  ## Impact

  A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry.

  ## Patches

  This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9.  Users should update to this version as soon as possible.

  ## Workarounds

  Ensure that any configured `credsStore` or `credHelpers` entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the `PATH`.
