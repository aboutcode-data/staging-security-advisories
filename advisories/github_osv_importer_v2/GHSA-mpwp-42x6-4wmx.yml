summary: |
  Grafana Fine-grained access control vulnerability
  ### Impact
  On Nov. 2, during an internal security audit, we discovered that when the fine-grained access control beta feature is enabled and there is more than one organization in the Grafana instance, Grafana 8.0 introduced a mechanism which allowed users with the Organization Admin role to list, add, remove, and update users’ roles in other organizations in which they are not an admin.

  ### Patches
  Fixed in 8.2.4

  ### Workarounds
  All installations between v8.0 and v8.2.3 that have fine-grained access control beta enabled and more than one organization should be upgraded as soon as possible. If you cannot upgrade, you should turn off the fine-grained access control using a [feature flag](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/enterprise/access-control/#enable-fine-grained-access-control/).

  Grafana Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability.
