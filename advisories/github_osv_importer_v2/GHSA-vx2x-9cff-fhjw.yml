  DSInternals Credential Roaming Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
  ### Impact

  A vulnerability exists in the `DSInternals.Common.Data.RoamedCredential.Save()` method, which incorrectly parses the `msPKIAccountCredentials` LDAP attribute values. As a consequence, a malicious actor would be able to modify the file system of the computer where an application using this function is executed with administrative privileges.

  A [similar security issue](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-30170) used to be present in the Windows operating system, as DSInternals re-implements the Credential Roaming feature of Windows.

  ### Exploitability

  The vulnerability can be exploited under the following circumstances:
  - An attacker is able to modify the `msPKIAccountCredentials` attribute of a user account in Active Directory. This attribute is used by the Credential Roaming feature of Windows and each AD user can modify their own roamed credentials. AND
  - A 3rd party application uses the `DSInternals.Common` library to export roamed credentials from Active Directory to a file system. AND
  - The application has administrative privileges on the local system.

  The probability of any 3rd-party product using the `DSInternals.Common` library being affected by this vulnerability is extremely low.

  ### Patches

  The issue had been fixed in DSInternals 4.8.
