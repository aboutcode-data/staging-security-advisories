  - CVE-2024-23651
summary: |
  BuildKit vulnerable to possible race condition with accessing subpaths from cache mounts
  ### Impact
  Two malicious build steps running in parallel sharing the same cache mounts with subpaths could cause a race condition that can lead to files from the host system being accessible to the build container.

  ### Patches
  The issue has been fixed in v0.12.5

  ### Workarounds
  Avoid using BuildKit frontend from an untrusted source or building an untrusted Dockerfile containing cache mounts with `--mount=type=cache,source=...` options.
