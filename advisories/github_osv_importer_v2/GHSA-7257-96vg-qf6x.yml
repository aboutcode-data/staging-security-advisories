summary: |
  Remote Code Execution in Red Discord Bot
  ### Impact
  A RCE exploit has been discovered in the Streams module: this exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted "going live" messages to inject code into the Streams module's going live message. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information.

  ### Patches
  This critical exploit has been fixed on version ``3.3.12`` & ``3.4``.

  ### Workarounds
  Unloading the Streams module with ``unload streams`` can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to ``3.3.12`` or ``3.4`` to completely patch this issue.
