summary: |
  TYPO3 Unverified Password Change for Backend Users
  ### Problem
  The backend user management interface allows password changes without requiring the current password. When an administrator updates their own account or modifies other user accounts via the admin interface, the current password is not requested for verification.

  This behavior may lower the protection against unauthorized access in scenarios where an admin session is hijacked or left unattended, as it enables password changes without additional authentication.

  ### Solution
  Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12 LTS that fix the problem described.

  > [!NOTE]
  > In these versions, administrators are required to verify their identity through step-up authentication (also known as sudo mode) when changing backend user passwords.

  ### Credits
  Thanks to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) of Switzerland for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke for fixing it.
