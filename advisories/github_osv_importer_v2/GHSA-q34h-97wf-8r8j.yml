summary: |
  vault-cli contains possible RCE when reading user-defined data
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values (as explained in the [documentation](https://github.com/peopledoc/vault-cli/blob/2.2.1/docs/howto/templated_secrets.rst)). When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template.
  Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and it's not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk.
  If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you.

  This does not impact `vault` itself, except for the fact that the attacker, having an RCE on the machine that executes `vault-cli`, may abuse the token that `vault-cli` uses, to read, write or delete other data from the vault.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability.
  Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.

  ### References
  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_
