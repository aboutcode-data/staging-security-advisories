summary: "Server secret was included in static assets and served to clients\n### Impact\nServer\
  \ JWT signing secret was included in static assets and served to clients.\n\nThis ALLOWS Flood's\
  \ builtin authentication to be bypassed. Given Flood is granted access to rTorrent's SCGI\
  \ interface (which is unprotected and ALLOWS arbitrary code execution) and usually wide-ranging\
  \ privileges to files, along with Flood's lack of security controls against authenticated\
  \ users, the severity of this vulnerability is **CRITICAL**. \n\n### Background\nCommit 8d11640b\
  \ imported `config.js` to client (frontend) components to get `disableUsersAndAuth` configuration\
  \ variable. Subsequently contents of `config.js` are compiled into static assets and served\
  \ to users. Unfortunately `config.js` also includes `secret`.\n\nIntruders can use `secret`\
  \ to sign authentication tokens themselves to bypass builtin access control of Flood.\n\n\
  ### Patches\nCommit 042cb4ce removed imports of `config.js` from client (frontend) components.\
  \ Additionally an eslint rule was added to prevent config.js from being imported to client\
  \ (frontend) components.\n\nCommit 103f53c8 provided a general mitigation to this kind of\
  \ problem by searching static assets to ensure `secret` is not included before starting server\
  \ (backend). \n\n### Workarounds\nUsers shall upgrade if they use Flood's builtin authentication\
  \ system.\n\nWhile maintainers will do their best to support it, Flood cannot guarantee its\
  \ in-house access control system can stand against determined attackers in high-stake environments.\
  \ \n\n> Use `HTTP Basic Auth` or other battle-hardened authentication methods instead of Flood's\
  \ in-house one. You can use `disableUsersAndAuth` to avoid duplicate authentication.\n\nUsers\
  \ are advised to check out the [wiki](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki) for more information\
  \ on security precautions.\n\n### References\n[Wiki - Security precautions](https://github.com/jesec/flood/wiki/Security-precautions)\n\
