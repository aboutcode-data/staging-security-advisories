aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15184
summary: |
  Aliases are never checked in helm
  ### Impact

  During a security audit of Helm's code base, security researchers at Trail of Bits identified a bug in which the `alias` field on a `Chart.yaml` is not properly sanitized. This could lead to the injection of unwanted information into a chart.

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11

  ### Specific Go Packages Affected
  helm.sh/helm/v3/pkg/chartutil

  ### Workarounds

  Manually review the `dependencies` field of any untrusted chart, verifying that the `alias` field is either not used, or (if used) does not contain newlines or path characters.
