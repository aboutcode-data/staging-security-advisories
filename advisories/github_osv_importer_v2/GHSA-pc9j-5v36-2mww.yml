summary: "AWS SDK for Swift adopted defense in depth enhancement for region parameter value\n\
  CVSSv3.1 Rating: 3.7 (LOW)\n\nSummary\nThis notification is related to the use of specific\
  \ values for the region input field when calling AWS services. An actor with access to the\
  \ environment in which the SDK is used could set the region input field to an invalid value.\n\
  \nA defense-in-depth enhancement has been implemented in the AWS SDK for Swift. This enhancement\
  \ validates that a region used to construct an endpoint URL is a valid host label. The change\
  \ was released on November 6, 2025. This advisory is informational to help customers understand\
  \ their responsibilities regarding configuration security.\n\nImpact\nCustomer applications\
  \ could be configured to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts.\
  \ While the SDK was functioning safely within the requirements of the shared responsibility\
  \ model, additional safeguards have been added to support secure customer implementations.\n\
  \nImpacted versions: All versions prior to 2025-11-06 release (below 1.5.79) \n\nPatches\n\
  On November 6, 2025 an enhancement was made to the AWS SDK for Swift release, which validates\
  \ the formatting of a region, providing additional safeguards.\n\nWorkarounds\nNo workarounds\
  \ are needed, but as always you should ensure that your application is following security\
  \ best practices:\n- Implement proper input validation in your application code\n- Update\
  \ to the latest AWS SDK for Swift release on a regular basis\n- Follow AWS security best practices\
  \ [1] for SDK configuration\n\nReferences\nContact AWS Security via the vulnerability reporting\
  \ page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\nAcknowledgement\n\
  AWS SDK thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security considerations to our attention\
  \ through the coordinated disclosure process.\n\n \n\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-swift/latest/developer-guide/security.html"
