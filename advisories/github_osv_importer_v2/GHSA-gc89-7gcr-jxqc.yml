summary: "Buildkit credentials inlined to Git URLs could end up in provenance attestation\n\
  When the user sends a build request that contains a Git URL that contains credentials and\
  \ the build creates a provenance attestation describing that build, these credentials could\
  \ be visible from the provenance attestation.\n\nGit URL can be passed in two ways:\n\n1)\
  \ Invoking build directly from a URL with credentials.\n\n```\nbuildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0\
  \ --context https://<credentials>@url/repo.git\n```\n\nEquivalent in `docker buildx` would\
  \ be\n\n```\ndocker buildx build https://<credentials>@url/repo.git\n```\n\n2) If the client\
  \ sends additional VCS info hint parameters on builds from a local source. Usually, that would\
  \ mean reading the origin URL from `.git/config` file. \n\nThanks to Oscar Alberto Tovar for\
  \ discovering the issue.\n\n### Impact\nWhen a build is performed under specific conditions\
  \ where credentials were passed to BuildKit they may be visible to everyone who has access\
  \ to provenance attestation.\n\nProvenance attestations and VCS info hints were added in version\
  \ v0.11.0. Previous versions are not vulnerable.\n\nIn v0.10, when building directly from\
  \ Git URL, the same URL could be visible in `BuildInfo` structure that is a predecessor of\
  \ Provenance attestations. Previous versions are not vulnerable.\n\nNote: [Docker Build-push\
  \ Github action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) builds from Git URLs by default\
  \ but **is not** affected by this issue even when working with private repositories because\
  \ the credentials are passed [with build secrets](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/blob/v4.0.0/src/context.ts#L203)\
  \ and not with URLs.\n\n### Patches\nBug is fixed in v0.11.4 . \n\n### Workarounds\nIt is\
  \ recommended to pass credentials with build secrets when building directly from Git URL as\
  \ a more secure alternative than modifying the URL.\n\nIn Docker Buildx, VCS info hint can\
  \ be disabled by setting `BUILDX_GIT_INFO=0`. `buildctl` does not set VCS hints based on `.git`\
  \ directory, and values would need to be passed manually with `--opt`.\n\n\n### References\n\
