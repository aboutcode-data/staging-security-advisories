summary: |
  OpenFGA Authorization Bypass
  ### Overview
  During our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions `v0.2.3` and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.

  ### Am I Affected?
  You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version `v0.2.3` or prior, and your model has a relation defined as a tupleset (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement) that involves anything other than a direct relationship (e.g. ‘as self’)

  ### How to fix that?
  Upgrade to version `v0.2.4`.

  ### Backward Compatibility
  This update is not backward compatible.
  Any model involving rewritten tupleset relations will no longer be acceptable and has to be modified.
