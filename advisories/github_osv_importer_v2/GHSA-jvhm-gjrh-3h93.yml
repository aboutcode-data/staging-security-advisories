summary: "Nuxt allows DOS via cache poisoning with payload rendering response\n### Summary\n\
  \nBy sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible in some circumstances\
  \ to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site.\n\nIt is possible\
  \ to craft a request, such as `https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json` which will be rendered\
  \ as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether\
  \ to cache a route, then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site.\n\
  \n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can perform this attack to a vulnerable site in order to make\
  \ a site unavailable indefinitely. It is also possible in the case where the cache will be\
  \ reset to make a small script to send a request each X seconds (=caching duration) so that\
  \ the cache is permanently poisoned making the site completely unavailable.\n\n\n## Conclusion\
  \ : \n\nThis is similar to a vulnerability in Next.js that resulted in CVE-2024-46982 (and\
  \ see [this article](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-cache-and-chains-the-stale-elixir),\
  \ in particular the \"Internal URL parameter and pageProps\" part, the latter being very similar\
  \ to the one concerning us here.)"
