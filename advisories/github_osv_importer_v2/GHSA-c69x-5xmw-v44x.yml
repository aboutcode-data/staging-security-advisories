summary: |
  CasaOS Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts vulnerability
  ### Summary
  Here it is observed that the CasaOS doesn't defend against password brute force attacks, which leads to having full access to the server.

  ### Details
  The web application lacks control over the login attempts i.e. why attacker can use a password brute force attack to find and get full access over the.

  ### PoC
  1. Capture login request in proxy tool like Burp Suite and select password field.

  2. Here I have started attack with total number of 271 password tries where the last one is the correct password and as we can see in the following image we get a **400 Bad Request** status code with the message "**Invalid Password**" and response length **769** on 1st request which was sent at **_Tue, 16 Jan 2024 18:31:32 GMT_**

  ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297157815-c158995b-7d46-4a5a-aef9-bcbbcf596b15.png)

  **Note**:  _We have tested this vulnerability with more than 3400 tries. We have used 271 request counts just for demo purposes._


  3. Here the attack is completed and we can see in the following image we get **200 OK** status code with the message "**Ok**" and response length **1509** on 271st request which was sent at **_Tue, 16 Jan 2024 18:32:01 GMT_**.

  ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297159282-3f4788b5-6217-4f32-8be6-40ac117710e3.png)

  This means attacker can try 271 requests in 56 seconds.

  ### Impact
  This vulnerability allows attackers to get super user-level access over the server.


  ### Mitigation
  It is recommended to implement a proper rate-limiting mechanism on the server side where the configuration might be like:
  If a specific IP address fails to login more than 5 times concurrently then that IP address must be blocked for at least 30 seconds. This will reduce the possibility of password brute-forcing attacks.
