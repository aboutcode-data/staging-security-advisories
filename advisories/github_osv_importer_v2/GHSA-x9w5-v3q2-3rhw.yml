summary: "browserify-sign upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` leads to a signature forgery\
  \ attack\n### Summary\nAn upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker\
  \ to construct signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading\
  \ to a signature forgery attack.\n\n### Details\nIn `dsaVerify` function, it checks whether\
  \ the value of the signature is legal by calling function `checkValue`, namely, whether `r`\
  \ and `s` are both in the interval `[1, q - 1]`. However, the second line of the `checkValue`\
  \ function wrongly checks the upper bound of the passed parameters, since the value of `b.cmp(q)`\
  \ can only be `0`, `1` and `-1`, and it can never be greater than `q`. \n\nIn this way, although\
  \ the values of `s` cannot be `0`, an attacker can achieve the same effect as zero by setting\
  \ its value to `q`, and then send `(r, s) = (1, q)` to pass the verification of any public\
  \ key.\n\n### Impact\nAll places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input\
  \ signatures will be affected by this vulnerability.\n\n\n### Fix PR:\nSince the temporary\
  \ private fork was deleted, here's a webarchive of the PR discussion and diff pages: [PR webarchive.zip](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/files/13172957/PR.webarchive.zip)"
