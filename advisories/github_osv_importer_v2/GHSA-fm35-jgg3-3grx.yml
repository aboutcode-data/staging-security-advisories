  NaN/INF in serverbound movement packets can crash clients and servers
  ### Impact
  A malicious client may send a `MovePlayerPacket` to the server whose position or rotation contains NaN or INF. Since neither the server nor vanilla client handles this properly, a number of interesting side effects come into play.

  - The server may crash in various ways if this exploit is used, because some mathematical operations on NaN/INF generate PHP warnings, which are converted into exceptions.
  - Clients may not be able to see other clients who have a NaN/INF rotation.
  - Clients may also crash in such cases.

  ### Patches
  A patch for this was included in the 3.18.1 release: https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/fb20bb38327b4c08ee3976640cd0dd547388a638

  ### Workarounds
  Workarounds could be implemented as plugins using `DataPacketReceiveEvent` to block any inbound movement packets containing bogus values.
