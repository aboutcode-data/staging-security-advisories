summary: |
  melange QEMU runner could write files outside workspace directory
  An attacker who can influence the tar stream from a QEMU guest VM could write files outside the intended workspace directory on the host. The `retrieveWorkspace` function extracts tar entries without validating that paths stay within the workspace, allowing Path Traversal via `../` sequences.

  **Fix:** Fixed in [6e243d0d](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/commit/6e243d0d46699f837d7c392397a694d2bcc7612b). Merged in release.
