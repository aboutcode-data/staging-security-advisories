summary: "SurrealDB has uncaught exception in Net module that leads to database crash\nA vulnerability\
  \ was found where an attacker can crash the database via crafting a HTTP query that returns\
  \ a null byte. The problem relies on an uncaught exception in the `net` module, where the\
  \ result of the query will be converted to JSON before showing as the HTTP response to the\
  \ user in the **/sql** endpoint.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows any authenticated\
  \ user to crash a SurrealDB instance by sending a crafted query with a null byte to the /sql\
  \ endpoint. \n\nWhere SurrealDB is used as an application backend, it is possible that an\
  \ application user can crash the SurrealDB instance and thus the supported application through\
  \ crafted inputs that exploit this attack vector.\n\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced\
  \ that ensures the error is caught and converted as an error.\n- Versions 2.2.2, 2.1.5 and\
  \ 2.0.5 and later are not affected by this isssue\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAffected users who\
  \ are unable to update may want to limit the ability of untrusted clients to run arbitrary\
  \ queries in the affected versions of SurrealDB. To limit the impact of the denial of service,\
  \ SurrealDB administrators may also want to ensure that the SurrealDB process is running so\
  \ that it can be automatically re-started after a crash.\n\nWhere SurrealDB is used as an\
  \ application backend, ensure sanitisation of input at the application layer to prevent injection\
  \ attacks.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/5647"
