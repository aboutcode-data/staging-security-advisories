  Prototype Pollution in lodash.merge
  Versions of `lodash.merge` before 4.6.1 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The function 'merge' may allow a malicious user to modify the prototype of `Object` via `__proto__` causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.




  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 4.6.1 or later.
