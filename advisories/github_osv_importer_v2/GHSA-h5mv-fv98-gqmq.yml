summary: |
  OS command injection vulnerability in Jenkins Play Framework Plugin
  A form validation endpoint in Play Framework Plugin executes the `play` command to validate a given input file.

  Play Framework Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier lets users specify the path to the `play` command on the Jenkins controller. This results in an OS command injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on the Jenkins controller (e.g. through archiving artifacts).
