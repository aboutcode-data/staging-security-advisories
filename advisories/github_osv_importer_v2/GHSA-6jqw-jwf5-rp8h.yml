summary: "Path traversal allows leaking out-of-bound Helm charts from Argo CD repo-server\n\
  ### Impact\nIn Argo CD versions prior to 2.3 (starting at least in v0.1.0, but likely in any\
  \ version using Helm before 2.3), using a specifically-crafted Helm file could reference external\
  \ Helm charts handled by the same repo-server to leak values, or files from the referenced\
  \ Helm Chart. This was possible because Helm paths were predictable. \n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ worked by adding a Helm chart that referenced Helm resources from predictable paths. Because\
  \ the paths of Helm charts were predictable and available on an instance of repo-server, it\
  \ was possible to reference and then render the values and resources from other existing Helm\
  \ charts regardless of permissions. While generally, secrets are not stored in these files,\
  \ it was nevertheless possible to reference any values from these charts. \n\n### Patches\n\
  This issue was fixed in Argo CD 2.3 and subsequent versions by randomizing Helm paths.\n\n\
  ### Workarounds\nUser's still using Argo CD 2.3 or below are advised to update to a [supported\
  \ version](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/#supported-versions).\
  \ If this is not possible, disabling Helm chart rendering, or using an additional repo-server\
  \ for each Helm chart would prevent possible exploitation.  \n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-63qx-x74g-jcr7\n\
