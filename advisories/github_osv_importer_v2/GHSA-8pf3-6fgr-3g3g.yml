summary: |
  `chainId` may be outdated if user changes chains as part of connection in @web3-react
  ### Impact
  `chainId` may be outdated if the user changes chains as part of the connection flow. This means that the value of `chainId` returned by `useWeb3React()` may be incorrect. In an application, this means that any data derived from `chainId` could be incorrect.

  For example, if a swapping application derives a wrapped token contract address from the `chainId` *and* a user has changed chains as part of their connection flow the application could cause the user to send funds to the incorrect address when wrapping. This is a common approach when using other foundational libraries like [`ethers`](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js), and most users of v8 will want to upgrade past the affected versions.

  ### Patches
  Patched in https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/pull/749.
  Users of web3-react@8.0.x-beta.0 should upgrade to at least:
   - @web3-react/coinbase-wallet@^8.0.35-beta.0
   - @web3-react/eip1193@^8.0.27-beta.0
   - @web3-react/metamask@^8.0.30-beta.0
   - @web3-react/walletconnect@^8.0.37-beta.0
