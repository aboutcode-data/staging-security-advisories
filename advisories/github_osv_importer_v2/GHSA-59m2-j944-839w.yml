  - CVE-2016-10655
summary: "clang-extra downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `clang-extra` insecurely\
  \ download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker\
  \ has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace\
  \ the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `clang-extra`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability. The package\
  \ author stated that no patch is possible until llvm provides HTTPS support, and a patch would\
  \ be possible if that ever happened in the future.\n\nThe best mitigation option is to reduce\
  \ the risk of exploitation as much as possible. This can be done by ensuring that this package\
  \ is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private\
  \ network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised\
  \ your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors\
  \ or Rogue ISP Employees."
