summary: "SurrealDB CPU exhaustion via custom functions result in total DoS\nSurrealDB allows\
  \ authenticated users with `OWNER` or `EDITOR` permissions at the root, database or namespace\
  \ levels to define their own database functions using the `DEFINE FUNCTION` statement\n\n\
  A custom database function comprises a name together with a function body. In the function\
  \ body, the user programs the functionality of the function in terms of SurrealQL. The language\
  \ includes a `FOR` keyword, used to implement for-loops.\n\nWhilst the parser and interpreter\
  \ constrain the number of iterations for a single for-loop, nesting several for-loops with\
  \ a large number of iterations is possible. Thus, an attacker could define a function that\
  \ comprises several nested for-loops with an iteration count of 1.000.000 each. \n\nExecuting\
  \ the function will consume all the CPU time of the server, timeouts configured will not break\
  \ the CPU consumption, and the function execution monopolizes all CPU time of the SurrealDB\
  \ server, effectively preventing the server from executing functions, queries, commands of\
  \ other users, or allowing further connections being established to the server.\n\nTerminating\
  \ the stuck server requires manual intervention which forces a quit on the server process,\
  \ as the server application is not responsive any longer.\n\nThis issue was discovered and\
  \ patched during an code audit and penetration test of SurrealDB by cure53, the severity defined\
  \ within cure53's preliminary finding is high, matched by our CVSS v4 assessment.\n\n### Impact\n\
  Denial of Service vulnerability resulting in a stuck SurrealDB server requiring manual restart.\n\
  \n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced that adds a check in the `ForEachStatement` that\
  \ checks if the context has been cancelled or timed out for every iteration.\n\n- Versions\
  \ 2.0.5, 2.1.5, 2.2.2, and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor SurrealDB\
  \ users that are unable to upgrade, consider setting the `--allow-functions` and/or `--deny-functions`\
  \ options or corresponding `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_FUNC` and/or `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_FUNC` environment\
  \ variables, documented within [capabilities](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities#functions),\
  \ to either block all custom functions, or only allow trusted functions to execute. \n\n\n\
