  Cross-Site Scripting in bootstrap-vue
  Versions of `bootstrap-vue` prior to 2.0.0-rc.12 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Due to insufficient input sanitization, components may be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting through the `options` variable. This may lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript on the user's browser.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.0.0-rc.12 or later.
