  Silverstripe has Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities inherited from TinyMCE
  TinyMCE 4.x is vulnerable to several XSS vectors, which had been patched in later versions. Two of these have been identified as affecting `silverstripe/admin`.

  Only Silverstripe CMS 4 is affected by this issue. It's not possible to upgrade Silverstripe CMS 4 to use a more recent release of TinyMCE without introducing breaking changes. Instead, the security patches that shipped in later releases of TinyMCE have been backported to the TinyMCE version bundled in `silverstripe/admin`.

  Silverstripe CMS 5 is not affected by those vulnerabilities because it uses TinyMCE 6.
