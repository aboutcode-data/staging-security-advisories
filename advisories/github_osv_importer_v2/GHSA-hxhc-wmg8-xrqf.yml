  namshi/jose insecure JSON Web Signatures (JWS)
  namshi/jose allows the acceptance of unsecure JSON Web Signatures (JWS) by default. The vulnerability arises from the $allowUnsecure flag, which, when set to true during the loading of JWSes, permits tokens signed with 'none' algorithms to be processed. This behavior poses a significant security risk as it could allow an attacker to impersonate users by crafting a valid jwt token.
