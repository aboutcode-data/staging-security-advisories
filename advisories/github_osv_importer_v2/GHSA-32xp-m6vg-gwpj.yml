aliases:
  - CVE-2020-2233
summary: |
  Missing permission check in Jenkins Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs
  Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

  An enumeration of credentials IDs in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.3 requires the appropriate permissions.
