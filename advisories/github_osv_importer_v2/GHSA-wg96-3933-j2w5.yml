summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting in sanitize-html
  Affected versions of `sanitize-html` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

  ## Proof of Concept:

  `<IMG SRC= onmouseover="alert('XSS');">`
  produces the following:

  `<img src="onmouseover="alert('XSS');"" />`
  This is definitely invalid HTML, but would suggest that it's being interpreted incorrectly by the parser.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 1.2.3 or later.
