summary: "Sequelize - Default support for “raw attributes” when using parentheses\n### Impact\n\
  \nSequelize 6.28.2 and prior has a dangerous feature where using parentheses in the attribute\
  \ option would make Sequelize use the string as-is in the SQL\n\n```ts\nUser.findAll({\n \
  \ attributes: [\n    ['count(id)', 'count']\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nProduced\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(id)\
  \ AS \"count\" FROM \"users\"\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThis feature was deprecated in Sequelize\
  \ 5, and using it prints a deprecation warning.\n\nThis issue has been patched in [`@sequelize/core@7.0.0.alpha-20`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15374)\
  \ and [`sequelize@6.29.0`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15710). \n\nIn Sequelize\
  \ 7, it now produces the following:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"count(id)\" AS \"count\" FROM \"users\"\
  \n```\n\nIn Sequelize 6, it throws an error explaining that we had to introduce a breaking\
  \ change, and requires the user to explicitly opt-in to either the Sequelize 7 behavior (always\
  \ escape) or the Sequelize 5 behavior (inline attributes that include `()` without escaping).\
  \ See https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15710 for more information.\n\n### Mitigations\n\
  \nDo not use user-provided content to build your list or attributes. If you do, make sure\
  \ that attribute in question actually exists on your model by checking that it exists in the\
  \ `rawAttributes` property of your model first.\n\n---\n\nA discussion thread about this issue\
  \ is open at https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/discussions/15694\nCVE: CVE-2023-22578"
