  - CVE-2022-31074
summary: |
  KubeEdge Cloud AdmissionController component DoS
  ### Impact
  Several endpoints including `/devicemodels`, `/rules`, `/ruleendpoints`, `/offlinemigration` in the Cloud Admissioncontroller may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large Body is sent to it.
  Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be affected when users deploy a Cloud Admissioncontroller. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the Cloud Admissioncontroller will be in denial of service.

  ### Patches
  This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

  ### Workarounds
  At the time of writing, no workaround exists.

  ### References
  NA
