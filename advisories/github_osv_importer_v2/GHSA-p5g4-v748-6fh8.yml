summary: |
  tarteaucitron.js allows url scheme injection via unfiltered inputs
  A vulnerability was identified in `tarteaucitron.js`, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as `javascript:alert()`. Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution if a user clicked on a malicious link.

  ## Impact
  An attacker with high privileges could insert a link exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to:
  - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code
  - Theft of sensitive data through phishing attacks
  - Modification of the user interface behavior

  ## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/2fa1e01023bce2e4b813200600bb1619d56ceb02
  The issue was resolved by enforcing strict URL validation, ensuring that they start with `http://` or `https://` before being used.
