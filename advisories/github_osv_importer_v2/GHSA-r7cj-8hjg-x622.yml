  - CVE-2021-43608
summary: "DBAL 3 SQL Injection Security Vulnerability\nWe have released a new version Doctrine\
  \ DBAL 3.1.4 that fixes a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the LIMIT clause generation\
  \ API provided by the Platform abstraction.\n\nWe advise everyone using Doctrine DBAL 3.0.0\
  \ up to 3.1.3 to upgrade to 3.1.4 immediately.\n\nThe vulnerability can happen when unsanitized\
  \ input is passed to many APIs in Doctrine DBAL and ORM that ultimately end up calling `AbstractPlatform::modifyLimitQuery`.\
  \ \n\nAs a workaround you can cast all limit and offset parameters to integers before passing\
  \ them to Doctrine APIs.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2021-43608](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-43608)."
