summary: |
  Jenkins GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin missing permission check allows enumerating credentials IDs
  Jenkins GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.42.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
