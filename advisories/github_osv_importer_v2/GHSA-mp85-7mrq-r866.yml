aliases:
  - CVE-2025-64527
summary: |
  ### Summary
  Envoy crashes when JWT authentication is configured with the remote JWKS fetching, `allow_missing_or_failed` is enabled, multiple JWT tokens are present in the request headers and the JWKS fetch fails.

  ### Details
  This is caused by a re-entry bug in the `JwksFetcherImpl`. When the first token's JWKS fetch fails, `onJwksError()` callback triggers processing of the second token, which calls fetch() again on the same fetcher object.

  The original callback's reset() then clears the second fetch's state (`receiver_ and request_`) which causes a crash when the async HTTP response arrives.

  ### PoC
  * `allow_missing_or_failed` or `allow_missing` is enabled
  * The client send 2 Authorization headers
  * the remote JWKS fetching failed
  * There will be crash

  ### Impact
  DoS and Crash

  ### Mitigation
  * Disable the `allow_missing_or_failed` or `allow_missing`
