summary: "eZ Platform Prevent accepting app.php in URL in Platform.sh\nThe recommended rewrite\
  \ rules in eZ Platform prevent users from including the front-controller script (normally\
  \ \"app.php\") in URLs. This prevents certain vulnerabilities related to caching. However,\
  \ this is not possible when using eZ Platform Cloud (i.e. running eZ Platform on the Platform.sh\
  \ cloud service), nor can it be done within the .platform.app.yaml configuration file. Therefore\
  \ we need to reject such requests in the application itself. This advisory adds the prevention\
  \ within the front controller script itself.\n \nIf you use eZ Platform Cloud / Platform.sh\
  \ we recommend that you install this security update as soon as possible. It is distributed\
  \ via Composer as ezsystems/ezplatform 1.7.9.1, and 1.13.5.1, and 2.5.4. This is the commit:\
  \ https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/commit/34ce86722b36a172e587068fe64a84faa7320cc2"
