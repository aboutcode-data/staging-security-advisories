  Client-Side JavaScript Prototype Pollution in oro/platform
  ### Summary

  By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. Later this injection may lead to JS code execution by libraries that are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.

  ### Workarounds

  Configure WAF to drop requests containing next strings: `__proto__` , `constructor[prototype]`, `constructor.prototype`
