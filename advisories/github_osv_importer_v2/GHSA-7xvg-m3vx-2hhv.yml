  - CVE-2016-10600
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in webrtc-native\nAffected versions of `webrtc-native`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `webrtc-native`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo direct patch is currently available\
  \ for this vulnerability. \n\nHowever, if the native components of `webrtc-native` are built\
  \ from source, this avoids download the precompiled binary, therefore mitigating the insecure\
  \ download. \n\nThe package author has provided instructions for building from source [here](https://github.com/vmolsa/webrtc-native/wiki/Getting-started#building-from-source)."
