  - CVE-2025-48379
summary: "Pillow vulnerability can cause write buffer overflow on BCn encoding\nThere is a heap\
  \ buffer overflow when writing a sufficiently large (>64k encoded with default settings) image\
  \ in the DDS format due to writing into a buffer without checking for available space. \n\n\
  This only affects users who save untrusted data as a compressed DDS image. \n\n* Unclear how\
  \ large the potential write could be. It is likely limited by process segfault, so it's not\
  \ necessarily deterministic. It may be practically unbounded. \n* Unclear if there's a restriction\
  \ on the bytes that could be emitted. It's likely that the only restriction is that the bytes\
  \ would be emitted in chunks of 8 or 16. \n\nThis was introduced in Pillow 11.2.0 when the\
  \ feature was added."
