  Duplicate Advisory: Data races in ticketed_lock
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-77m6-x95j-75r5. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket<T>` & `WriteTicket<T>`.
  This allows to send non-Send `T` to other threads.

  This can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as `T` of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

  The flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`.
