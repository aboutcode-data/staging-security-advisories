aliases:
  - CVE-2023-48707
summary: |
  Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in HMAC SHA256 Authentication
  ### Impact
  **secretKey**, an important key for HMAC SHA256 authentication, was stored in the database in raw form.

  If a malicious person somehow had access to the data in the database, they could use the key and secretKey for HMAC SHA256 authentication to send requests impersonating that person.

  ### Patches
  Upgrade to Shield v1.0.0-beta.8 or later.

  After upgrading, all existing secret keys must be encrypted.
  See https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/blob/develop/UPGRADING.md for details.

  ### Workarounds
  None.
