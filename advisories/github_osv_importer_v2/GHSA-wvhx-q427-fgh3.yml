aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34078
summary: |
  Arbitrary HTML present after sanitization because of unicode normalization
  ### Impact

  If using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.

  ### Workarounds

  Set `keep_typographic_whitespace=True` explicitly, or normalize to NFKC yourself earlier.
