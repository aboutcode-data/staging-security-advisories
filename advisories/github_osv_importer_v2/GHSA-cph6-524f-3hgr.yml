summary: |
  Directus Vulnerable to Information Leakage in Existing Collections
  ### Summary:

  An observable difference in error messaging was found in the Directus REST API. The `/items/{collection}` API returns different error messages for these two cases:
  1. A user tries to access an existing collection which they are not authorized to access.
  2. A user tries to access a non-existing collection.

  The two differing error messages leak the existence of collections to users which are not authorized to access these collections.

  ### Details:

  The following response returns an error message, when requesting a collection the user is not authorized to access.

  ```
  GET /items/no-access
  {
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "You don't have permission to access collection \"no-access\" or it does not exist. Queried in root.",
        "extensions": {
          "reason": "You don't have permission to access collection \"no-access\" or it does not exist. Queried in root.",
          "code": "FORBIDDEN"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  The following response returns a different error message when requesting a collection which does not exist.

  ```
  GET /items/does-not-exist
  {
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "You don't have permission to access this.",
        "extensions": {
          "code": "FORBIDDEN"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ### Impact:

  The difference in errors between non-existent collections and collections blocked by permissions leak the existence of a collection to a user which is not authorized to access this object.
