  - CVE-2021-32770
summary: |
  Basic-auth app bundle credential exposure in gatsby-source-wordpress
  ### Impact
  The gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time.  Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected.

  Example affected gatsby-config.js:
  ```
        resolve: 'gatsby-source-wordpress',
          auth: {
            htaccess: {
              username: leaked_username
              password: leaked_password,
            },
          },
  ```

  ### Patches
  A patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the `auth: { }` section.  Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run `gatsby clean` followed by a `gatsby build`.


  ### Workarounds
  There is no known workaround at this time, other than manually editing the app.js file post-build.
