  - CVE-2025-67713
summary: "Miniflux has an Open Redirect via protocol-relative redirect_url\n### Summary\n`redirect_url`\
  \ is treated as safe when `url.Parse(...).IsAbs()` is false. Protocol-relative URLs like `//ikotaslabs.com`\
  \ have an empty scheme and pass that check, allowing post-login redirects to attacker-controlled\
  \ sites.\n\n### Details\n- `url.Parse(\"//ikotaslabs.com\")` => empty Scheme, Host=\"ikotaslabs.com\"\
  .\n- `IsAbs()` returns false for `//ikotaslabs.com`, so the code treats it as allowed.\n-\
  \ Browser resolves `//ikotaslabs.com` to current-origin scheme (e.g. `https://ikotaslabs.com`),\
  \ enabling phishing flows after login.\n\n### PoC\n1. Send or visit: `http://localhost/login?redirect_url=//ikotaslabs.com`\
  \  \n2. Complete normal login flow.  \n3. After login the app redirects to `https://ikotaslabs.com`\
  \ (or `http://` depending on origin).\n\n### Acknowledgements  \nThis vulnerability was discovered\
  \ using the automated vulnerability analysis tools **VulScribe** and **PwnML**.   The research\
  \ and tool development were conducted  with support from the **MITOU Advanced Program (未踏アドバンスト事業)**,\
  \ implemented by the **Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), Japan**."
