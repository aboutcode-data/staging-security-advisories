  Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel and Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness in rucio-webui
  ### Impact
  `rucio-webui` installations of the `1.26` release line potentially leak the contents of cookies to other sessions within a wsgi container. Impact is that Rucio authentication tokens are leaked to other users accessing the `webui` within a close timeframe, thus allowing users to access the `webui` with the leaked authentication token. Privileges are therefore also escalated.

  Rucio server / daemons are not affected by this issue, it is isolated to the webui.

  ### Patches
  This issue is fixed in the `1.26.7` release of the `rucio-webui`.

  ### Workarounds
  Installation of the `1.25.7` `webui` release. The `1.25` and previous webui release lines are not affected by this issue.
