summary: |
  Mautic Vulnerable to User Enumeration via Response Timing
  ### Impact
  The attacker can validate if a user exists by checking the time login returns. This timing difference can be used to enumerate valid usernames, after which an attacker could attempt brute force attacks.

  ### Patches
  This vulnerability has been patched, implementing a timing-safe form login authenticator that ensures consistent response times regardless of whether a user exists or not.

  ### Technical Details
  The vulnerability was caused by different response times when:
  - A valid username was provided (password hashing occurred)
  - An invalid username was provided (no password hashing occurred)

  The fix introduces a `TimingSafeFormLoginAuthenticator` that performs a dummy password hash verification even for non-existent users, ensuring consistent timing.

  ### Workarounds
  No workarounds are available. Users should upgrade to the patched version.
