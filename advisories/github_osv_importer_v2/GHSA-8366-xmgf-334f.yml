summary: |
  REDAXO allows Authenticated Reflected Cross Site Scripting - packages installation
  ### Summary
  Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of web vulnerability that occurs when a web application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the application's response to a user's request. When the user's browser receives the response, the malicious code is executed, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or take control of the user's account.

  ### Details
  On the latest version of Redaxo, v5.18.2, the rex-api-result parameter is vulnerable to Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) on the page of AddOns.

  ### PoC
  1. Login Redaxo as administrative user.
  2. Navigate to the URL: [http://localhost/redaxo/index.php?page=packages&rex-api-call=package&&rex-api-result={%22succeeded%22%3Atrue%2C%22message%22%3A%22%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain);%3E%22}](http://localhost/redaxo/index.php?page=packages&rex-api-call=package&&rex-api-result=%7B%22succeeded%22%3Atrue%2C%22message%22%3A%22%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.domain);%3E%22%7D), the XSS executes.
