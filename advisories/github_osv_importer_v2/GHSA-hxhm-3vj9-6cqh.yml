  - CVE-2016-10632
summary: "apk-parser2 downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `apk-parser2` insecurely\
  \ download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker\
  \ has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace\
  \ the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `apk-parser2`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability, and the package\
  \ has not been updated since 2014.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this\
  \ package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation\
  \ can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public\
  \ network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit\
  \ this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged\
  \ access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
