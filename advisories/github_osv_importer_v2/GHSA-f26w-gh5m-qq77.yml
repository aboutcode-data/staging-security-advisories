  - CVE-2025-49140
summary: |
  Pion Interceptor's improper RTP padding handling allows remote crash for SFU users (DoS)
  ### Impact
  Pion Interceptor versions v0.1.36 through v0.1.38 contain a bug in a RTP packet factory that can be exploited to trigger a panic with Pion based SFU via crafted RTP packets, This only affect users that use pion/interceptor.

  ### Patches

  Upgrade to v0.1.39 or later, which includes PR [#338](https://github.com/pion/interceptor/pull/338) which validates that: `padLen > 0 && padLen <= payloadLength` and return error  on overflow, avoiding panic.

  If upgrading is not possible, apply the patch from the pull request manually or drop packets whose P-bit is set but whose padLen is zero or larger than the remaining payload.

  ### Workarounds
  At the application layer, reject any RTP packet where:
  ```
  hasPadding (P-bit field) == true  &&  (padLen == 0 || padLen > packetLen – headerLen)
  ```

  before passing it to Pion’s packet factories.
