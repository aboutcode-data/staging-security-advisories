summary: "`SegQueue` creates zero value of any type\nAffected versions of this crate called\
  \ `mem::zeroed()` to create values of a user-supplied type `T`.\nThis is unsound e.g. if `T`\
  \ is a reference type (which must be non-null).\n \nThe flaw was corrected by avoiding the\
  \ use of `mem::zeroed()`, using `MaybeUninit` instead."
