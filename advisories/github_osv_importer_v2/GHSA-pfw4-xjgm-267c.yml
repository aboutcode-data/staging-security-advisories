aliases:
  - CVE-2022-39200
summary: |
  Dendrite signature checks not applied to some retrieved missing events
  ### Impact

  Events retrieved from a remote homeserver using `/get_missing_events` did not have their signatures verified correctly. This could potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this endpoint.

  Note that this does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g. `/event`, `/state`) as they have been correctly verified.

  Homeservers that have federation disabled are not vulnerable.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8.

  ### Workarounds

  There are no workarounds.

  ### Special thanks

  Tulir Asokan, who spotted the issue originally.
