summary: "Unencrypted traffic between nodes when using IPsec and L7 policies\n### Impact\n\n\
  In Cilium clusters with IPsec enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies:\n\n- Traffic\
  \ that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent\
  \ unencrypted\n- Traffic that should be IPsec-encrypted between a node's DNS proxy and pods\
  \ on other nodes is sent unencrypted\n\n**Note:** For clusters running in native routing mode,\
  \ IPsec encryption is not applied to connections which are selected by a L7 Egress Network\
  \ Policy or a DNS Policy. This is a known limitation of Cilium's IPsec encryption which will\
  \ continue to apply after upgrading to the latest Cilium versions described below.\n\n###\
  \ Patches\n\nThis issue affects: \n\n- Cilium v1.15 before v1.15.2\n- Cilium v1.14 before\
  \ v1.14.8\n- Cilium v1.13 before v1.13.13\n- Cilium v1.4 to v1.12 inclusive\n\nThis issue\
  \ has been resolved in:\n\n- Cilium v1.15.2\n-  Cilium v1.14.8\n-  Cilium v1.13.13\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\nThere is no workaround to this issue.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe Cilium community\
  \ has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks\
  \ to @jschwinger233, @julianwiedmann, @giorio94, and @jrajahalme for their work in triaging\
