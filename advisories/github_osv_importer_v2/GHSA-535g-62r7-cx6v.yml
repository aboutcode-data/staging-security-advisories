aliases:
  - CVE-2025-62607
summary: |
  Nautobot Single Source of Truth (SSoT) has an unauthenticated ServiceNow configuration URL
  The servicenow config URL is using a generic django View with no authentication.

  URL: `/plugins/ssot/servicenow/config/`

  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_
  An Unauthenticated attacker could access this page to view the Service Now public instance name e.g. `companyname.service-now.com`. This is considered **low-value information**.  This does not expose the Secret, the Secret Name, or the Secret Value for the Username/Password for Service-Now.com. An unauthenticated member would not be able to change the instance name, nor set a Secret. There is not a way to gain access to other pages Nautobot through the unauthenticated Configuration page.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_
  We highly recommend upgrading to SSoT v3.10.0 which includes this patch.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_
  Disable the servicenow SSoT integration
