  - CVE-2025-47935
summary: |
  Multer vulnerable to Denial of Service via memory leaks from unclosed streams
  ### Impact

  Multer <2.0.0 is vulnerable to a resource exhaustion and memory leak issue due to improper stream handling. When the HTTP request stream emits an error, the internal `busboy` stream is not closed, violating Node.js stream safety guidance.

  This leads to unclosed streams accumulating over time, consuming memory and file descriptors. Under sustained or repeated failure conditions, this can result in denial of service, requiring manual server restarts to recover. All users of Multer handling file uploads are potentially impacted.


  ### Patches

  Users should upgrade to `2.0.0`


  ### Workarounds

  None
