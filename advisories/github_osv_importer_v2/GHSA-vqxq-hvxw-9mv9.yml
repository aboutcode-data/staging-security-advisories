aliases:
  - CVE-2024-24570
summary: |
  Statmic CMS vulnerable to account takeover via XSS and password reset link
  ### Impact

  HTML files crafted to look like jpg files are able to be uploaded, allowing for XSS.

  This affects:

  - front-end forms with asset fields without any mime type validation
  - asset fields in the control panel
  - asset browser in the control panel

  Additionally, if the XSS is crafted in a specific way, the "copy password reset link" feature may be exploited to gain access to a user's password reset token and gain access to their account. The authorized user is required to execute the XSS in order for the vulnerability to occur.

  ### Patches

  In versions 4.46.0 and 3.4.17, the XSS vulnerability has been patched, and the copy password reset link functionality has been disabled. (Users may still trigger password reset emails.)

  ### Credits

  Statamic thanks Niklas Schilling (discovery, analysis, coordination) from the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab (https://www.sec-consult.com/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues and working with us as we addressed them.
