summary: |
  Static Web Server affected by timing-based username enumeration in Basic Authentication due to early response on invalid usernames
  ## Summary

  A Timing-based username enumeration in Basic Authentication vulnerability due to early response on invalid usernames could allow attackers to identify valid users and focus their efforts on targeted brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.

  ## Details

  SWS validates the provided username before performing any password verification.
  - **Invalid Username:** The server returns a `401 Unauthorized` response immediately.
  - **Valid Username:** The server proceeds to verify the password (e.g., using `bcrypt`), which introduces a different execution path and measurable timing discrepancy.

  This allows an attacker to distinguish between existing and non-existing accounts by analyzing response times.

  ## PoC

  The following statistical results were obtained by measuring the mean response time over 100 iterations using a custom Rust script:

  | User Type | Average Response Time |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | **Invalid User** | 0.409861 ms |
  | **Valid User** | 0.250925 ms |
  | **Difference** | **~0.158936 ms** |

  While the valid user responded faster in this specific test environment, the statistically significant gap confirms that the authentication logic does not execute in constant time.

  ## Impact

  Users using the SWS' Basic Authentication feature are primarily impacted.
