  - CVE-2025-67847
summary: |
  Moodle affected by a code injection vulnerability
  A flaw was found in Moodle. An attacker with access to the restore interface could trigger server-side execution of arbitrary code. This is due to insufficient validation of restore input, which leads to unintended interpretation by core restore routines. Successful exploitation could result in a full compromise of the Moodle application.
