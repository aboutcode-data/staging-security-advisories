summary: "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore Open Redirect vulnerability\n### Impact\n\
  \nIt's possible to exploit well known parameters in XWiki URLs to perform redirection to untrusted\
  \ site. This vulnerability was partially fixed in the past for XWiki 12.10.7 and 13.3RC1 but\
  \ there is still the possibility to force specific URLs to skip some checks, e.g. using URLs\
  \ like `http:example.com` in the parameter would allow the redirect. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe\
  \ issue has now been patched against all patterns that we know about for performing redirect.\
  \ It also performs a real URI parsing that should protect in most cases. This has been patched\
  \ in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only workaround is to upgrade XWiki.\n\
  \n### References\n\n  * JIRA ticket: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20096\n  * JIRA ticket\
  \ about the improvment actually fixing the vulnerability: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20549\n\
