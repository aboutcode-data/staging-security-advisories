summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins Security Inspector plugin
  Security Inspector Plugin 117.v6eecc36919c2 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows attackers to replace the generated report stored in a per-session cache and displayed to authorized users at the `…​/report` URL with a report based on attacker-specified report generation options. This could create confusion in users of the plugin who are expecting to see a different result. A security hardening since Jenkins 2.287 and LTS 2.277.2 prevents exploitation of this vulnerability for the _Single user, multiple jobs_ report however, there is no fix at this time. Other report types are still affected.
