summary: "evmos allows transferring unvested tokens after delegations\n## Impact\n\nThis advisory\
  \ has been created to address the following vulnerabilities found in the Evmos codebase and\
  \ affecting vesting accounts.\n\n### Wrong spendable balance computation\n\nThe spendable\
  \ balance is not updated properly when delegating vested tokens. The following example help\
  \ in describing the issue:\n- Given a clawback vesting account with a starting `15M` vesting\
  \ schedule. The initial spendable balance is `0`.\n- Time passes and `5M` are vested. The\
  \ spendable balance is now `5M`.\n- The account delegate `5M`. The spendable balance should\
  \ be `0`, but returns `5M`\n- The account can send `5M` to another account.\n\nThe issue allowed\
  \ a clawback vesting account to anticipate the release of unvested tokens.\n\n### Missing\
  \ precompile checks\n\nPreliminary checks on actions computed by the clawback vesting accounts\
  \ are performed in the ante handler. Evmos core, implements two different ante handlers: one\
  \ for Cosmos transactions and one for Ethereum transactions. Checks performed on the two implementation\
  \ are different.\n\nThe vulnerability discovered allowed a clawback account to bypass Cosmos\
  \ ante handler checks by sending an Ethereum transaction targeting a precompile used to interact\
  \ with a Cosmos SDK module.\n\n### Missing create validator check\n\nThis vulnerability allowed\
  \ a user to create a validator using vested tokens to deposit the self-bond.\n\n## Patches\n\
  \n- The spendable balance function has been fixed correcting the `TrackDelegation` function.\n\
  - The checks for the staking module, for the delegation and the create validator, has been\
  \ moved into the `MsgServer` of a wrapper around the Cosmos SDK staking module. \n\nThe issues\
  \ have been patched in versions >=V18.0.0.\n\n## References\n1. [Evmos vesting module](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/modules/vesting)\n\
