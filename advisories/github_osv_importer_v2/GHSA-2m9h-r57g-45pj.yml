summary: "Downloading malicious GitHub Actions workflow artifact results in path traversal vulnerability\n\
  ### Summary\n\nA security vulnerability has been identified in GitHub CLI that could create\
  \ or overwrite files in unintended directories when users download a malicious GitHub Actions\
  \ workflow artifact through `gh run download`. \n\n### Details\n\nThis vulnerability stems\
  \ from a GitHub Actions workflow artifact named `..` when downloaded using `gh run download`.\
  \  The artifact name and `--dir` flag are used to determine the artifact’s download path.\
  \  When the artifact is named `..`, the resulting files within the artifact are extracted\
  \ exactly 1 directory higher than the specified `--dir` flag value.\n\nIn `2.63.1`, `gh run\
  \ download` will not download artifacts named `..` and `.` and instead exit with the following\
  \ error message:\n\n```\nerror downloading ..: would result in path traversal\n```\n\n###\
  \ Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation heightens the risk of local path traversal attack vectors\
  \ exactly 1 directory higher than intended.\n\n### Remediation and Mitigation\n\n1. Upgrade\
  \ `gh` to `2.63.1`\n2. Implement additional validation to ensure artifact filenames do not\
  \ contain potentially dangerous patterns, such as `..`, to prevent path traversal risks."
