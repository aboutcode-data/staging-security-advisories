  Use of insecure jQuery version in OctoberCMS
  ### Impact
  Passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.

  ### Patches
  Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466) by applying the recommended patch from @jquery.

  ### Workarounds
  Apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/5c7ba9fbe9f2b596b2f0e3436ee06b91b97e5892 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 466.
