summary: |
  Navidrome Stores JWT Secret in Plaintext in navidrome.db
  Navidrome stores the JWT secret in plaintext in the `navidrome.db` database file under the `property` table. This practice introduces a security risk because anyone with access to the database file can retrieve the secret.
  The JWT secret is critical for the authentication and authorization system. If exposed, an attacker could:
  - Forge valid tokens to impersonate users, including administrative accounts.
  - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform privileged actions.
  This vulnerability has been tested on the latest version of Navidrome and poses a significant risk in environments where the database file is not adequately secured.
