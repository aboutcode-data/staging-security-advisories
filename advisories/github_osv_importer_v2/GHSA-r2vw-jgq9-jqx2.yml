  Improper Authorization in @sap-cloud-sdk/core
  Affected versions of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core` do not properly validate JWTs.  The `verifyJwt()` function does not properly validate the URL from where the public verification key for the JWT can be downloaded.  Any URL was trusted which makes it possible to provide a URL belonging to a manipulated JWT.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.21.2 or later.
