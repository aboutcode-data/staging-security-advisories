  Cross-Site Scripting in swagger-ui
  Versions of `swagger-ui` prior to 2.2.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package allows HTML code in the `swagger.apiInfo.description` value without proper sanitization, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.2.1 or later.
