summary: |
  Out of bounds write in calamine
  An issue was discovered in the calamine crate before 0.17.0 for Rust. It allows attackers to overwrite heap-memory locations because Vec::set_len is used without proper memory claiming, and this uninitialized memory is used for a user-provided Read operation, as demonstrated by Sectors::get.
