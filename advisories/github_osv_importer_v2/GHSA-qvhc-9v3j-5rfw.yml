  ### <a name="how-fix"></a>How do I fix the issue?

  To update the Using the System.Security.Cryptography.Cose NuGet package, use one of the following methods:

  NuGet Package Manager UI in Visual Studio:
  - Open your project in Visual Studio.
  - Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages..." or navigate to "Project > Manage NuGet Packages".
  - In the NuGet Package Manager window, select the "Updates" tab. This tab lists packages with available updates from your configured package sources.
  - Select the package(s) you wish to update. You can choose a specific version from the dropdown or update to the latest available version.
  - Click the "Update" button.

  Using the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:
  - Open your project in Visual Studio.
  - Navigate to "Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console".
  - To update a specific package to its latest version, use the following Update-Package command:

  ```
  Update-Package -Id System.Security.Cryptography.Cose
  ```

  Using the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface):
  - Open a terminal or command prompt in your project's directory.
  - To update a specific package to its latest version, use the following add package command:

  ```
  dotnet add package System.Security.Cryptography.Cose
  ```

  Once you have updated the nuget package reference you must recompile and deploy your application. Additionally we recommend you update your runtime and/or SDKs, but it is not necessary to patch the vulnerability.
