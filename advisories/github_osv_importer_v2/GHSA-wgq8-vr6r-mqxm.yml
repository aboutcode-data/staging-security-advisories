summary: "frost-core: refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of group\n\
  ### Impact\n\nIt was not clear that it is not possible to change `min_signers` (i.e. the threshold)\
  \ with the refresh share functionality (`frost_core::keys::refresh` module). Using a smaller\
  \ value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller threshold would\
  \ fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold, it would still\
  \ be possible to sign with the original threshold; however, this could cause a security loss\
  \ to the participant's shares. We have not determined the exact security implications of doing\
  \ so and judged simpler to just validate `min_signers`. \n\n If for some reason you have done\
  \ a refresh share procedure with a smaller `min_signers` we strongly recommend migrating to\
  \ a new key. \n\n### Patches\n\nUpdating to 2.2.0 will ensure that the `min_signers` parameter\
  \ will be validated. However it won't restore the security of groups refreshed with a smaller\
  \ `min_signers` parameters.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou don't need to update if you don't use\
  \ the refresh share functionality, or if you didn't try to change the `min_signers` parameter\
  \ using the refresh share functionality.\n\n### References\n\nThank you [BlockSec](https://blocksec.com/)\
  \ for reporting the finding"
