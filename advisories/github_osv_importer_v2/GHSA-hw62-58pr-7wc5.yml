summary: "DOM Expressions has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper use\
  \ of string.replace\n> [!NOTE]  \n> This advisory was originally emailed to community@solidjs.com\
  \ by @nsysean.\n\nTo sum it up, the use of javascript's `.replace()` opens up to potential\
  \ XSS vulnerabilities with the special replacement patterns beginning with `$`.\n\nParticularly,\
  \ when the attributes of `Meta` tag from solid-meta are user-defined, attackers can utilise\
  \ the special replacement patterns, either `$'` or `$\\`` to achieve XSS.\n\nThe solid-meta\
  \ package has this issue since it uses `useAffect` and context providers, which injects the\
  \ used assets in the html header. \"dom-expressions\" uses `.replace()` to insert the assets,\
  \ which is vulnerable to the special replacement patterns listed above. \n\nThis effectively\
  \ means that if the attributes of an asset tag contained user-controlled data, it would be\
  \ vulnerable to XSS. For instance, there might be meta tags for the open graph protocol in\
  \ a user profile page, but if attackers set the user query to some payload abusing `.replace()`,\
  \ then they could execute arbitrary javascript in the victim's web browser. Moreover, it could\
  \ be stored and cause more problems."
