summary: "SpiceDB's LookupResources may return partial results\n### Impact\nAny user making\
  \ a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupResources request with\
  \ 1.22.0 is affected.\n\nFor example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources\
  \ to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not.\
  \ But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead, then some users\
  \ that shouldn't have access may.\n\nGenerally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be\
  \ used to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version\
  \ 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  Avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions if using `1.22.0`. \n\n\
  ### Patches\nThe only affected release is [v1.22.0](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.22.0),\
  \ and it is patched in [v1.22.2](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.22.2)\
  \ (there is no v1.22.1 release, though there is a git tag).\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/1397\n\
