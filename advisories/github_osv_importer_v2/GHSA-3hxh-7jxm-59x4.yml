  AtomicBucket<T> unconditionally implements Send/Sync
  In the affected versions of the crate, `AtomicBucket<T>` unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` traits. Therefore, users can create a data race to the inner
  `T: !Sync` by using the `AtomicBucket::data_with()` API.
  Such data races can potentially cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

  The flaw was fixed in commit 8e6daab by adding appropriate Send/Sync bounds to the Send/Sync impl of struct `Block<T>` (which is a data type contained inside `AtomicBucket<T>`).
