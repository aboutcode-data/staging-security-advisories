summary: "`docker cp` allows unexpected chmod of host files in Moby Docker Engine\n## Impact\n\
  A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy files using `docker cp` into\
  \ a specially-crafted container can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files\
  \ in the host’s filesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow files\
  \ to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process.\n\n## Patches\n\
  This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version\
  \ as soon as possible. Running containers do not need to be restarted.\n\n## Workarounds\n\
  Ensure you only run trusted containers.\n\n## Credits\nThe Moby project would like to thank\
  \ Lei Wang and Ruizhi Xiao for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the \uFEFF\
  [Moby security policy](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n## For more\
