summary: |
  CloudCore CSI Driver: Malicious response from KubeEdge can crash CSI Driver controller server
  ### Impact
  A malicious message response from KubeEdge can crash the CSI Driver controller server by triggering a nil-pointer dereference panic. As a consequence, the CSI Driver controller will be in denial of service. An attacker would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud, and only when the authenticated user launches the `csidriver` then CloudCore may be attacked.

  ### Patches
  This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

  ### Workarounds
  At the time of writing, no workaround exists.

  ### References
  NA
