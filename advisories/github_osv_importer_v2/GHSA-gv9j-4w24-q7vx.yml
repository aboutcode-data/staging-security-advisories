  Improper random number generation in github.com/coredns/coredns
  ### Impact

  CoreDNS before 1.6.6 (using go DNS package < 1.1.25) improperly generates random numbers because math/rand is used. The TXID becomes predictable, leading to response forgeries.

  ### Patches
  The problem has been fixed in 1.6.6+.
