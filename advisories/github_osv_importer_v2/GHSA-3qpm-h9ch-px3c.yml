  Remote code injection, Improper Input Validation and Uncontrolled Recursion in Log4j library
  ### Summary
  The version used of Log4j, the library used for logging by PowerNukkit, is subject to a remote code execution vulnerability via the ldap JNDI parser.
  It's well detailed at [CVE-2021-44228](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q) and  CVE-2021-45105(https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p6xc-xr62-6r2g).

  ### Impact
  Malicious client code could be used to send messages and cause remote code execution on the server.

  ### Patches
  PowerNukkit `1.5.2.1` is a patch-release that only updates the Log4j version to `2.17.0` and should be used instead of `1.5.2.0`.
  All versions prior to `1.5.2.1` are affected and are not patched.

  ### Workarounds
  If you can't upgrade, you can use the `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` startup argument as remediation, as this prevents the vulnerability from happening.
