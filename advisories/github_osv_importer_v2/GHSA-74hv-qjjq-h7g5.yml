summary: |
  datasette-graphql leaks details of the schema of private database files
  ### Impact

  When running against a Datasette instance with private databases, `datasette-graphql` would expose the schema of those database tables - but not the table contents.

  ### Patches

  Patched in version 1.2.

  ### Workarounds

  This issue is only present if a Datasette instance that includes private databases and has the `datasette-graphql` plugin installed is available on the public internet. Uninstalling the `datasette-graphql` plugin or preventing public access to the instance can workaround this issue.
