  - CVE-2021-21339
summary: |
  Cleartext storage of session identifier
  ### Problem
  User session identifiers were stored in cleartext - without processing of additional cryptographic hashing algorithms. This vulnerability cannot be exploited directly and occurs in combination with a chained attack - like for instance SQL injection in any other component of the system.

  ### Solution
  Update to TYPO3 versions 6.2.57, 7.6.51, 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 that fix the problem described.

  ### Credits
  Thanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team members Benni Mack & Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.
