  - CVE-2024-28101
summary: "Apollo Router's Compressed Payloads do not respect HTTP Payload Limits\n### Impact\n\
  The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run\
  \ a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service\
  \ (DoS) type vulnerability. When receiving compressed HTTP payloads, affected versions of\
  \ the Router evaluate the `limits.http_max_request_bytes` configuration option after the entirety\
  \ of the compressed payload is decompressed. If affected versions of the Router receive highly\
  \ compressed payloads, this could result in significant memory consumption while the compressed\
  \ payload is expanded. \n\n### Patches\nRouter version 1.40.2 has a fix for the vulnerability.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nIf you are unable to upgrade, you may be able to implement mitigations\
  \ at proxies or load balancers positioned in front of your Router fleet (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy,\
  \ or cloud-native WAF services) by creating limits on HTTP body upload size."
