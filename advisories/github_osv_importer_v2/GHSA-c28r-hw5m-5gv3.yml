summary: "Partial Path Traversal in com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-s3\n### Overview\n\nA partial-path\
  \ traversal issue exists within the `downloadDirectory` method in the AWS S3 TransferManager\
  \ component of the AWS SDK for Java v1. Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory`\
  \ argument, but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects.\
  \ The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in the object\
  \ key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor\
  \ could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key. Under\
  \ certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve a directory from their S3 bucket\
  \ that is one level up in the filesystem from their working directory. \n\nThis issue’s scope\
  \ is limited to directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination\
  \ directory`/tmp/foo`, the actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`.\
  \ \n\nVersions of the AWS Java SDK for S3 v1 before and including v1.12.260 are affected by\
  \ this issue. \n\n### Impact\n\nIf `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory`\
  \ is used to download an untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can be written\
  \ outside of the intended destination directory.\n\n#### Root Cause\n\nThe `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory`\
  \ contains a partial-path traversal vulnerability.\n\nThis is due to the guard logic in `leavesRoot`\
  \ containing an insufficient protection against partial-path traversal.\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/5be0807af763b9fbf6b0a153c76dd305e407f035/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1513-L1519\n\
  \nThe application controls the `localBaseDirectory` argument, but the `key` comes from the\
  \ AWS bucket entry (ie. can be attacker controlled). The above bit of logic can be bypassed\
  \ with the following payloads:\n\n```java\n// The following will return 'false', although\
  \ the attacker value will \"leave\" the `/usr/foo` directory\nleavesRoot(new File(\"/usr/foo\"\
  ), \"/../foo-bar/bar\")\n```\n\nThis guard is used here which should guard against path traversal,\
  \ however `leavesRoot` is an insufficient guard:\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/ae88c8aa4b195047b94c154897475f85642d7eb3/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1420-L1423\n\
  \n#### True Root cause\n\n If the result of `parent.getCanonicalPath()` is not slash terminated\
  \ it allows for partial path traversal.\n\n> Consider `\"/usr/outnot\".startsWith(\"/usr/out\"\
  )`. The check is bypassed although `outnot` is not under the `out` directory.\nThe terminating\
  \ slash may be removed in various places. On Linux `println(new File(\"/var/\"))` returns\
  \ `/var`, but `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\"))` - `/var/`, however `println(new File(\"\
  /var\", \"/\").getCanonicalPath())` - `/var`.\n \\- [@JarLob (Jaroslav Lobačevski)](https://github.com/JarLob)\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the AWS SDK for Java >= 1.12.261, if you are on a version < 1.12.261.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nWhen calling `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory`\
  \ pass a `KeyFilter` that forbids `S3ObjectSummary` objects that `getKey` method return a\
  \ string containing the substring `..` .\n\n### References\n\nSimilar vulnerabilities:\n -\
