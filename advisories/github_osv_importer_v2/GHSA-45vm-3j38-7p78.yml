aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34716
summary: |
  PrestaShop cross-site scripting via customer contact form in FO, through file upload
  ### Impact
  Only PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled are impacted, starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0.

  The impact is substantial, when the customer thread feature flag is enabled, through the front-office contact form, a hacker can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin opens the attached file in back office.

  Consequence: the script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right.

  ### Patches
  This vulnerability is patched in 8.1.6.

  ### Workarounds
  As long as you have not upgraded to 8.1.6, a simple workaround is to disable the customer-thread feature-flag.

  Thank you to Ayoub AIT ELMOKHTAR, who discovered this vulnerability and share it with the PrestaShop team.
