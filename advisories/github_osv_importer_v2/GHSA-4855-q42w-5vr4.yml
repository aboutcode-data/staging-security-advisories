  DoS Vulnerability in ntpd-rs
  # Summary

  A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in ntpd-rs where an attacker can induce a message storm between two NTP servers running ntpd-rs.

  # Details

  Since ntpd-rs version 1.2.0, when configured as a server, incorrectly responded to all NTP messages sent to the server's port with a time reply, including to responses from other servers. As a consequence, a message with a spoofed IP address of another server could cause two servers running ntpd-rs to continually respond to each other, consuming significant amounts of resources.

  # Impact

  Any time server running ntpd-rs with version between 1.2.0 and 1.6.1 inclusive which allows non-NTS traffic is affected. Client-only configurations are not affected. Affected users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.2 as soon as possible.

  # Workarounds

  Should upgrading not be possible, the impact of the issue can be mitigated by:
   - Whitelisting access to only IP addresses of clients using the server, using the ignore filter method.
   - Blocking incoming non-request traffic on the NTP server port using a firewall.
   - Disabling public access to the vulnerable NTP server
   - Disabling the server functionality by removing any [server] sections from the configuration.

  # Acknowledgements

  The ntpd-rs authors thank Eric Sesterhenn from X41 D-Sec GmbH for finding and reporting this issue.
