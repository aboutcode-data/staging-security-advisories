  CometBFT has inconsistencies between how commit signatures are verified and how block time is derived
  # CSA-2026-001: Tachyon

  ## Description

  **Name:** CSA-2026-001: Tachyon

  **Criticality:** Critical (Catastrophic Impact; Possible Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))

  **Affected versions:** All versions of CometBFT

  **Affected users:** Validators and protocols relying on block timestamps

  ## Description

  A consensus-level vulnerability was discovered in CometBFT's "BFT Time" implementation due to an inconsistency between how commit signatures are verified and how block time is derived.

  This breaks a core BFT Time guarantee: "A faulty process cannot arbitrarily increase the Time value."

  ## Impact

  Downstream impact on chains affects any module, smart contract, or system that relies on the block timestamp.

  ## Patches

  The new CometBFT releases [v0.38.21](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.21) and [v0.37.18](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.18) fix this issue. The `main` unreleased branch is also patched.

  ## Workarounds

  There are no effective workarounds for this vulnerability. Upgrading to patched versions is required.
