summary: |
  Craft CMS has a theoretical bypass for CVE-2025-23209
  **Pre-requisites:**

  * Have a compromised security key (https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/securing-craft#keep-your-secrets-secret)
  * Somehow, manage to create an arbitrary file in Craft’s `/storage/backups` folder.

  With those two pieces in place, you could create a specific, malicious request to the `/updater/restore-db` endpoint to execute CLI commands remotely.

  Fixed in https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/a19d46be78a9ca1ea474012a10e97bed0d787f57
