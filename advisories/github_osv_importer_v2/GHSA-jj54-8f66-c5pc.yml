summary: "[XBOW-025-068] XML External Entity (XXE) Processing Vulnerability in GeoServer WFS\
  \ Service\n## Summary\n\nGeoServer Web Feature Service (WFS) web service was found to be vulnerable\
  \ to GeoTools CVE-2025-30220 XML External Entity (XXE) processing attack.\n\nIt is possible\
  \ to trigger the parsing of external DTDs and entities, bypassing standard entity resolvers.\
  \  This allows for Out-of-Band (OOB) data exfiltration of local files accessible by the GeoServer\
  \ process, and Service Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\n## Details\n\nWhile direct entity resolution\
  \ is managed by application property ENTITY_RESOLUTION_ALLOWLIST for XML Parsing, this restriction\
  \ was not being used by the GeoTools library when building an in-memory XSD Library Schema\
  \ representation.\n\nThis bypasses GeoServer's AllowListEntityResolver enabling XXE attacks.\n\
  \n## PoC\n\nNo public PoC is provided but this vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable\
  \ through WFS service.\n\n## Impact\n\n* Information Disclosure: \n\n  This vulnerability\
  \ allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that\
  \ are accessible to the GeoServer process.\n  \n  This can lead to exposure of sensitive information\
  \ including configuration files, credentials, and system files. The attack can be performed\
  \ remotely without authentication, making it particularly severe.\n\n* Server-Side Request\
  \ Forgery (SSRF) \n  \n  The mechanism inherently allows forcing GeoServer to make HTTP requests\
  \ to arbitrary URLs, enabling SSRF attacks against internal network resources \n\n## References\n\

  \ Resolution](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/config.html#production-config-external-entities)\
  \ (GeoServer User Manual)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis vulnerability was initially reported\
  \ via an automated tool described below. Subsequently a duplicate report via @YacineF, and\
  \ their patience working with the GeoServer project, was instrumental finding in escalating\
  \ this issue and determining a resolution.\n\n### XBOW-025-068 Disclaimer\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ was detected using **[XBOW](https://xbow.com/)**, a system that autonomously finds and exploits\
  \ potential security vulnerabilities. The finding has been thoroughly reviewed and validated\
  \ by a security researcher before submission. While XBOW is intended to work autonomously,\
  \ during its development human experts ensure the accuracy and relevance of its reports."
