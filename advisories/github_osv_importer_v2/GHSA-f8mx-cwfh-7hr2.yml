summary: "TShock allows chat while not fully connected, possible ban evasion\nThis issue was\
  \ reported to TShock by @ohayo, but was found by the Discord user by the name of `sofurry.com`.\
  \ Please note that this user **does not own this domain on the internet, just the discord\
  \ handle**.\n\nTShock overrides certain Terraria vanilla systems, including chat, and the\
  \ connection handling, for its own purposes, like enforcing bans. When clients connect but\
  \ do not complete the connection handshake (e.g., send message number 6), they can \"exist\"\
  \ on the server, occupy a player slot, chat, and receive data from the server despite not\
  \ being fully connected. Individuals who exploit this will be able to effectively harass the\
  \ server, observe the server, and utilize server resources even if banned from the server.\n\
  \nFor servers that operate with a proxy that strictly enforces the connection handshake/sequence,\
  \ this is not an issue, but for smaller servers or servers running vanilla TShock this is\
  \ an issue worth patching for.\n\nPR body supplied by @ohayo (patch writer):\n\nTerraria's\
  \ standard server by default checks for bans upon the client sending the ConnectRequest packet,\
  \ however, TShock instead chooses to check if the client connecting is banned upon the Request\
  \ World Data packet.\n\nA malicious client can easily just not send this packet, and still\
  \ join the server even while being banned.\nAlso by not sending Request World Data, the malicious\
  \ client is still able to receive all packets from the server & even chat. \n\nOther clients\
  \ will not be notified of their join/leave but will be able to see them on the player list.\n\
  Leading to potential chat spam & \"spying\" on packets of players within the server."
