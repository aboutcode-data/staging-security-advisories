summary: |
  Jenkins Files Found Trigger Plugin allows attackers to check for existence of attacker-specified file path on Jenkins controller file system
  Jenkins Files Found Trigger Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system. A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list the Jenkins controller file system.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
