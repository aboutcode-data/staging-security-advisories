summary: |
  Privilege escalation: all users can access Admin-level API keys
  ### Impact
  An error in the implementation of the limits service in 4.0.0 allows all authenticated users (including contributors) to view admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability.

  Ghost(Pro) has already been patched. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version between 4.0.0 and 4.9.4. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site - see patches & workarounds below.

  It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching or applying the workaround below.

  ### Patches
  Fixed in 4.10.0, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.

  ### Workarounds
  - Disable all non-Administrator accounts to prevent API access.
