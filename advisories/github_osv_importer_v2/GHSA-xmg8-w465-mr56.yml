summary: "SQL Injection in Translation Export API\n### Impact\nSQL injection is a web security\
  \ vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application\
  \ makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally\
  \ able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that\
  \ the application itself is able to access. \n\nIn many cases, an attacker can modify or delete\
  \ this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior. In some\
  \ situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying\
  \ server or other back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack. It was observed\
  \ that the reported API endpoint accessible by an authenticated administrator user and is\
  \ vulnerable to SQL injection via the \"filter\" GET parameter. The parameter accepts JSON\
  \ formatted data. The value of JSON key \"property\" inside \"filter\" is not sanitized properly\
  \ and is used in a SQL statement in an unsafe manner, resulting in SQL injection\n\n### Patches\n\
