  - CVE-2022-25863
summary: "Unsanitized JavaScript code injection possible in gatsby-plugin-mdx\n### Impact\n\
  The gatsby-plugin-mdx plugin prior to versions 3.15.2 and 2.14.1 passes input through to the\
  \ `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration,\
  \ unless input is sanitized.  The vulnerability is present when passing input in both webpack\
  \ (MDX files in `src/pages` or MDX file imported as component in frontend / React code) and\
  \ data mode (querying MDX nodes via GraphQL).  Injected JavaScript executes in the context\
  \ of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would\
  \ need to be sourced or added into an MDX file.  The following MDX payload demonstrates a\
  \ vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"child_process\")).execSync(\"id >> /tmp/rce\"\
  ))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been introduced in `gatsby-plugin-mdx@3.15.2` and\
  \ `gatsby-plugin-mdx@2.14.1` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript\
  \ Frontmatter engine.  The patch introduces a new option, `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set\
  \ to `false` by default.  When setting `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx`\
  \ must be sanitized before processing to avoid a security risk.  Warnings are displayed when\
  \ enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true` or if it appears that the MDX input is attempting\
  \ to use the Frontmatter engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-plugin-mdx`\
  \ must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n\
  **We encourage projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins\
  \ to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.**\n\
  \n### Credits\nWe would like to thank Snyk [snyk.io] for initially bringing the issue to our\
  \ attention, as well as Feng Xiao and Zhongfu Su, who reported the issue to Snyk.\n\n### For\
