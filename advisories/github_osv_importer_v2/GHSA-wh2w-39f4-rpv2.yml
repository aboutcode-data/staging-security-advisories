summary: "Hyperledger Indy's update process of a DID does not check who signs the request\n\
  # Name\nUpdating a DID with a nym transaction will be written to the ledger if neither ROLE\
  \ or VERKEY are being changed, regardless of sender.\n\n# Description\nA malicious DID with\
  \ no particular role can ask an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role).\
  \ This is bad because:\n1. Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger (i.e., any DID\
  \ can spam the ledger with nym transactions).\n1. Any DID can change any other DID's alias.\
  \ \n1. The update transaction modifies the ledger metadata associated with a DID. \n\n# Expected\
  \ vs Observed\nWe expect that if a DID (with no role) wants to update another DID (not its\
  \ own or one it is the endorser), then the nodes should refuse the request. We can see that\
  \ requirements in the [Indy default auth_rules](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/auth_rules.md)\
  \ in Section \"Who is the owner\" in the last point of \"Endorser using\". \n\nWe observe\
  \ that with a normal DID, we can update the field `from` for a random DID, for example, the\
  \ one of a TRUSTEE. It creates then a new transaction on the ledger.\n\n# Explanation of the\
  \ attack\nWe first begin to connect to the pool and open a wallet. Then, we will use a TRUSTEE\
  \ (but can also be a STEWARD or an ENDORSER) DID `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f`. We ask the information\
  \ about `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f` with a get-nym. We create a new DID `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe1a`\
  \ signed by `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f` with no role. For the rest of the attack, we will use\
  \ `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe1a` to sign new transactions. We send a `ledger nym did=V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f\
  \ extra=hello` to see if `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe1a` can send an update of a TRUSTEE identity.\
  \ When we ask information to the ledger about `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f`, it answers that the\
  \ `from` field is `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe1a` (to compare with the first get-nym we did with\
  \ `from` field = `V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f`). To see the log of the attack, I modified my indy-cli\
  \ to print the json request and the json response directly on the terminal. You can find the\
  \ log file `indy.log` in this archive.\n\n# Implementation notes\n[NymHandler](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/e5676b703d625e42c9547333bd03bb8307ed534c/indy_node/server/request_handlers/domain_req_handlers/nym_handler.py)\
  \ method `update_state`, line 62. I think that we need to check if the DID which signs the\
  \ transaction, owns the DID or is its endorser.\n\n# Steps to Reproduce\n\n## Environment\n\
  Ubuntu 18.04\nDocker version 19.03.8\n[indy-cli](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/cli)\n\
  [indy-ci](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/ci) Dockerfile is copied in\
  \ this archive\nTo install indy-cli, run `./install_indy_cli.sh`\n\n\n## Command\nHere is\
  \ the script to create the container, run the attack and remove the container and the image.\
  \ Find below the command to execute each step separately.\n```\n./full_attack.sh\n```\n\n\
  ### Installation of the environment\nInstall indy-cli and create an image with tag `test`\
  \ from Dockerfile\n```\n./install.sh\n```\n\n### Exploit\n```\nindy-cli proof_of_concept\n\
  ```\n\n### Uninstallation of the environment\nSuppress the container `test` and remove the\
  \ image `test`\n```\n./uninstall.sh\n```\n# Analysis\nWe are grateful to @alexandredeleze\
  \ for discovering and responsibly disclosing the issue.\n\nWe were previously aware that any\
  \ DID on the ledger can \"update\" the state (seqNo + txnTime) if it doesn't change the state\
  \ data itself. We considered this a minor bug because only the seqNo and txnTime changed.\
  \ But seeing that this can also affect the \"parent\" DID means that it has a higher severity."
