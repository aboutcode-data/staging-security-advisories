  Duplicate Advisory: Helm passes repository credentials to alternate domain
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.
