  OpenClaw Twilio voice-call webhook auth bypass when ngrok loopback compatibility is enabled
  ## Summary

  A Twilio webhook signature-verification bypass in the voice-call extension could allow unauthenticated webhook requests when a specific ngrok free-tier compatibility option is enabled.

  ## Impact

  This issue is limited to configurations that explicitly enable and expose the voice-call webhook endpoint.

  Not affected by default:
  - The voice-call extension is optional and disabled by default.
  - The bypass only applied when `tunnel.allowNgrokFreeTierLoopbackBypass` was explicitly enabled.
  - Exploitation required the webhook to be reachable (typically via a public ngrok URL during development).

  Worst case (when exposed and the option was enabled):
  - An external attacker could send forged requests to the publicly reachable webhook endpoint that would be accepted without a valid `X-Twilio-Signature`.
  - This could result in unauthorized webhook event handling (integrity) and request flooding (availability).

  ## Affected Packages / Versions

  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.13` (latest published as of 2026-02-14)
  - Patched versions: `>= 2026.2.14` (planned next release; pending publish)

  ## Fix

  `allowNgrokFreeTierLoopbackBypass` no longer bypasses signature verification. It only enables trusting forwarded headers on loopback so the public ngrok URL can be reconstructed for correct signature validation.
