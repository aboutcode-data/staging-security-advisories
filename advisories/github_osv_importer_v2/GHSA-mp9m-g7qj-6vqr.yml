summary: |
  Unauthorized privilege escalation in Mod module
  ### Impact
  An unauthorized privilege escalation exploit has been discovered in the Mod module: this exploit allows Discord users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high privileges in.

  ### Patches
  This exploit has been fixed on version & ``3.4.1``.

  ### Workarounds
  Unloading the Mod module with ``unload mod`` __or__, disabling the ``massban`` command with ``command disable global massban`` can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to ``3.4.1`` to completely patch this issue.
