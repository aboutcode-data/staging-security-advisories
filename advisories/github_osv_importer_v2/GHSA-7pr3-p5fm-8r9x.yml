  - CVE-2021-41109
summary: |
  LiveQuery publishes user session tokens in parse-server
  ### Impact
  For regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload.

  ### Patches
  Remove session token from LiveQuery payload.

  ### Workaround
  Set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.
