summary: "league/oauth2-server key exposed in exception message when passing as a string and\
  \ providing an invalid pass phrase\n### Impact\nServers that passed their keys to the CryptKey\
  \ constructor as as string instead of a file path will have had that key included in a LogicException\
  \ message if they did not provide a valid pass phrase for the key where required. \n\n###\
  \ Patches\nThis issue has been patched so that the provided key is no longer exposed in the\
  \ exception message in the scenario outlined above. Users should upgrade to version 8.5.3\
  \ or 8.4.2 to receive the patch.\n\n### Workarounds\nWe recommend upgrading the oauth2-server\
  \ to one of the patched releases (8.5.3 or 8.4.2). If you are unable to upgrade you can avoid\
  \ this security issue by passing your key as a file instead of a string.\n\n### References\n\
