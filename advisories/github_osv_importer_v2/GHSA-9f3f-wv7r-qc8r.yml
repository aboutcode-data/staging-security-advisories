summary: "Pion DTLS's usage of random nonce generation with AES GCM ciphers risks leaking the\
  \ authentication key\n### Impact\nPion DTLS versions v1.0.0 through v3.0.10 use random nonce\
  \ generation with AES GCM ciphers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the\
  \ authentication key and spoof data by leveraging the reuse of a nonce in a session and a\
  \ \"forbidden attack\". \n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to v3.1.1 or later. This version includes\
  \ PR #796, which uses the 64-bit sequence number to populate the `nonce_explicit` part of\
  \ the GCM nonce. This is according to best practice outlined in [RFC 9325 section 7.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9325#section-7.2.1).\
  \ \n\nv3.0.11 is a backport patch supporting Go v1.21\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds\
  \ without upgrading to version v3.0.11, v3.1.1 or later.\n\n### References\nCommit fixing\
  \ the bug: https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/61762dee8217991882c5eb79856b9e7a73ee349f\n\
