summary: |
  Hono is Vulnerable to Authentication Bypass by IP Spoofing in AWS Lambda ALB conninfo
  ## Summary

  When using the AWS Lambda adapter (`hono/aws-lambda`) behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), the `getConnInfo()` function incorrectly selected the first value from the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

  Because AWS ALB appends the real client IP address to the end of the `X-Forwarded-For` header, the first value can be attacker-controlled.

  This could allow IP-based access control mechanisms (such as the `ipRestriction` middleware) to be bypassed.

  ## Details

  In ALB environments, AWS appends the actual client IP address to the end of any existing `X-Forwarded-For` header value. However, the previous implementation of `getConnInfo()` extracted the leftmost IP address:

  ```ts
  address = xff.split(',')[0].trim()
  ```

  If a client sent:

  ```
  X-Forwarded-For: <spoofed-ip>
  ```

  ALB would forward:

  ```
  X-Forwarded-For: <spoofed-ip>, <real-client-ip>
  ```

  Since the implementation selected the first value, the spoofed IP address was trusted. This affected applications using:

  ```ts
  ipRestriction(getConnInfo, { allowList: [...] })
  ```

  or any custom middleware relying on `getConnInfo(c).remote.address` for authorization decisions.

  The issue only affects deployments using the AWS Lambda adapter behind an ALB. API Gateway (v1/v2) and Lambda Function URLs are not affected, as they use AWS-provided source IP values from `requestContext`.

  ## Impact

  An unauthenticated remote attacker could bypass IP-based access restrictions by supplying a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header. This may allow access to resources that were intended to be restricted by IP address.

  Only applications deployed behind an ALB and relying on `getConnInfo()` for IP-based authorization are affected.
