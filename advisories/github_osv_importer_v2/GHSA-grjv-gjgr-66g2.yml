aliases:
  - CVE-2024-38361
summary: |
  SpiceDB exclusions can result in no permission returned when permission expected
  ### Background

  Use of an exclusion under an arrow that has multiple resources may resolve to `NO_PERMISSION` when permission is expected.

  For example, given this schema:

  ```zed
  definition user {}

  definition folder {
    relation member: user
    relation banned: user
    permission view = member - banned
  }

  definition resource {
    relation folder: folder
    permission view = folder->view
  }
  ```

  If the resource exists under *multiple* folders and the user has access to view more than a single folder, SpiceDB may report the user does not have access due to a failure in the exclusion dispatcher to request that *all* the folders in which the user is a member be returned

  ### Impact

  Permission is returned as `NO_PERMISSION` when `PERMISSION` is expected on the `CheckPermission` API.

  ### Workarounds

  None
