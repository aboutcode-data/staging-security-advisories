summary: |
  Next.js Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling
  ### Impact
  Inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions.

  For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js.

  ### Patches
  The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer. This includes Next.js `14.x`.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability. We recommend that you upgrade to a safe version.
