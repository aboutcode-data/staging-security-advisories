summary: |
  Zitadel allows brute-forcing authentication factors
  ### Summary

  A vulnerability in Zitadel allowed brute-force attack on OTP, TOTP and password allowing to impersonate the attacked user.

  ### Impact

  An attacker can perform an online brute-force attack on OTP, TOTP, and passwords. While Zitadel allows preventing online brute force attacks in scenarios like TOTP, Email OTP, or passwords using a lockout mechanism. The mechanism is not enabled by default and can cause a denial of service for the corresponding user if enabled. Additionally, the mitigation strategies were not fully implemented in the more recent resource-based APIs.

  ### Affected Versions

  All versions within the following ranges, including release candidates (RCs), are affected:
  - **4.x**: `4.0.0` to `4.4.0` (including RC versions)
  - **3.x**: `3.0.0` to `3.4.2` (including RC versions)
  - **2.x**: `v2.0.0` to `2.71.17`

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been addressed in the latest releases. The patch resolves the issue by enforcing the lockout policy on all OTP, TOTP and password checks. Additionally a “tar pit” has been introduced to slow down brute-force attacks by default. Zitadel responses will be delayed by t seconds, where t increases over the number of failed attempts within a given timeframe.

  4.x: Upgrade to >=[4.6.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.6.0)
  3.x: Update to >=[3.4.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.3)
  2.x: Update to >=[2.71.18](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.71.18)

  ### Workarounds

  The recommended solution is to update Zitadel to a patched version.

  The problem might be mitigated by enabling the optional logout policy ("Password maximum attempts") or by implementing more strict rate limits.
