summary: "CloudCore UDS Server: Malicious Message can crash CloudCore\n### Impact\nA malicious\
  \ message can crash CloudCore by triggering a null-pointer dereference in the UDS Server.\
  \ Since the UDS Server only communicates with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the attack\
  \ is limited to the local host network. As such, an attacker would already need to be an authenticated\
  \ user of the Cloud.\n \nIt will be affected only when users turn on the unixsocket switch\
  \ in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` as below:\n```\nmodules:\n  cloudHub:\n    ...\n   \
  \ unixsocket:\n      address: xxx\n      enable: true\n```\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been\
  \ fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to these versions to resolve\
  \ the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nDisable the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the config file\
  \ `cloudcore.yaml`.\n\n### References\nNA\n\n### Credits\nThanks David Korczynski and Adam\
  \ Korczynski of ADA Logics for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [kubeedge\
  \ security policy](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/policy) during a security\
  \ audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have\
  \ any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [KubeEdge repo](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/new/choose)\n\
