summary: "@octokit/request-error has a Regular Expression in index that Leads to ReDoS Vulnerability\
  \ Due to Catastrophic Backtracking\n### Summary\nA Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\
  \ vulnerability exists in the processing of HTTP request headers. By sending an authorization\
  \ header containing an excessively long sequence of spaces followed by a newline and \"@\"\
  , an attacker can exploit inefficient regular expression processing, leading to excessive\
  \ resource consumption. This can significantly degrade server performance or cause a denial-of-service\
  \ (DoS) condition, impacting availability.\n### Details\nThe issue occurs at [line 52](https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/blob/main/src/index.ts)\
  \ of iterator.ts in the @octokit/request-error repository.\nThe vulnerability is caused by\
  \ the use of an inefficient regular expression in the handling of the `authorization` header\
  \ within the request processing logic:\n```js\nauthorization: options.request.headers.authorization.replace(\n\
  \  / .*$/, \n  \" [REDACTED]\"\n)\n```\nThe regular expression `/ .*$/` matches a space followed\
  \ by any number of characters until the end of the line. This pattern is vulnerable to Regular\
  \ Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when processing specially crafted input. Specifically,\
  \ an attacker can send an `authorization` header containing a long sequence of spaces followed\
  \ by a newline and \"@\", such as:\n```js\nheaders: {\n  authorization: \"\" + \" \".repeat(100000)\
  \ + \"\\n@\",\n}\n```\nDue to the way JavaScript's regular expression engine backtracks while\
  \ attempting to match the space followed by arbitrary characters, this input can cause excessive\
  \ CPU usage, significantly slowing down or even freezing the server. This leads to a denial-of-service\
  \ condition, impacting availability.\n### PoC\n[The gist of PoC.js](https://gist.github.com/ShiyuBanzhou/e1203ad22701fd043b8501eb37676a0d)\n\
  1. run npm i @octokit/request-error\n2. run 'node poc.js'\nresult:\n3. then the program will\
  \ stuck forever with high CPU usage\n```js\nimport { RequestError } from \"@octokit/request-error\"\
  ;\n\nconst error = new RequestError(\"Oops\", 500, {\n  request: {\n    method: \"POST\",\n\
  \    url: \"https://api.github.com/foo\",\n    body: {\n      bar: \"baz\",\n    },\n    headers:\
  \ {\n      authorization: \"\"+\" \".repeat(100000)+\"\\n@\",\n    },\n  },\n  response: {\n\
  \    status: 500,\n    url: \"https://api.github.com/foo\",\n    headers: {\n      \"x-github-request-id\"\
  : \"1:2:3:4\",\n    },\n    data: {\n      foo: \"bar\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Impact\n\
  #### Vulnerability Type & Impact:\nThis is a `Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)\
  \ vulnerability`, which occurs due to an inefficient regular expression (`/ .*$/`) used to\
  \ sanitize the `authorization` header. An attacker can craft a malicious input that triggers\
  \ excessive backtracking in the regex engine, leading to high CPU consumption and potential\
  \ denial-of-service (DoS).\n#### Who is Impacted?\n* Projects or services using this code\
  \ to process HTTP headers are vulnerable.\n* Applications that rely on user-supplied `authorization`\
  \ headers are at risk, especially those processing a large volume of authentication requests.\n\
  * Multi-tenant or API-driven platforms could experience degraded performance or service outages\
  \ if exploited at scale."
