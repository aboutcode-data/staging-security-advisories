summary: "HTTP Smuggling via Transfer-Encoding Header in Puma\n### Impact\nThis is a similar\
  \ but different vulnerability to the one patched in 3.12.5 and 4.3.4.\n\nA client could smuggle\
  \ a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown\
  \ client. \n\nIf the proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request\
  \ in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however,\
  \ would see it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response\
  \ that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma\
  \ to send another request for a different client, the second response from the first client\
  \ will be sent to the second client.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in Puma\
  \ 3.12.6 and Puma 4.3.5.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments\
  \ about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma)\n* See our\
  \ [security policy](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/policy)"
