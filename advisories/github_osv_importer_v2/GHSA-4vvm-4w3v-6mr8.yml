summary: |
  pypdf and PyPDF2 possible Infinite Loop when a comment isn't followed by a character
  ### Impact
  An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if `__parse_content_stream` is executed. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF.

  Example Code and a PDF that causes the issue:

  ```python
  from pypdf import PdfReader

  # https://objects.githubusercontent.com/github-production-repository-file-5c1aeb/3119517/11367871?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWNJYAX4CSVEH53A%2F20230627%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230627T201018Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=d71c8fd9181c4875f0c04d563b6d32f1d4da6e7b2e6be2f14479ce4ecdc9c8b2&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=1658117&key_id=0&repo_id=3119517&response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3DMiFO_LFO_FEIS_NOA_Published.3.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf
  reader = PdfReader("MiFO_LFO_FEIS_NOA_Published.3.pdf")
  page = reader.pages[0]
  page.extract_text()
  ```

  The issue was introduced with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/969

  ### Patches

  The issue was fixed with https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1828

  ### Workarounds

  It is recommended to upgrade to `pypdf>=3.9.0`. PyPDF2 users should migrate to pypdf.

  If you cannot update your version of pypdf, you should modify `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`:

  ```
  OLD: while peek not in (b"\r", b"\n"):
  NEW: while peek not in (b"\r", b"\n", b""):
  ```
