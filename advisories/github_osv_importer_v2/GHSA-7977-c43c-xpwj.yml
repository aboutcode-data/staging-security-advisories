summary: |
  OpenClaw is vulnerable to validation bypass through GNU long-option abbreviations in allowlist mode
  In OpenClaw before 2026.2.23, tools.exec.safeBins validation for sort could be bypassed via GNU long-option abbreviations (such as --compress-prog) in allowlist mode, leading to approval-free execution paths that were intended to require approval. Only an exact string such as --compress-program was denied.
