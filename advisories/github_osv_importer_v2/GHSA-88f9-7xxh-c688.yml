summary: "Cachet configuration leak\n### Impact\n\nAuthenticated users, regardless of their\
  \ privileges (_User_ or _Admin_), can leak the value of any configuration entry of the dotenv\
  \ file, e.g. the application secret (`APP_KEY`) and various passwords (email, database, etc).\
  \ \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was addressed by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and\
  \ preventing the use of nested variables in the resulting dotenv configuration file.\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\n\nOnly allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.\n\
  \n### References\n\nFurther technical details are available at [https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection).\n\
