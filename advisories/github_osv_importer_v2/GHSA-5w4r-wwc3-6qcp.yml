  Malicious Package in precode.js
  Version 1.1.1 of `precode.js` contained malicious code. The code when executed in the browser would enumerate password, cvc and cardnumber fields from forms and send the extracted values to `https://js-metrics.com/minjs.php?pl=`



  ## Recommendation

  Remove the package from your environment and evaluate your application to determine whether or not user data was compromised.
