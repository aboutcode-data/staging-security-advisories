summary: "MinIO Java Client XML Tag Value Substitution Vulnerability\n#### Description\nIn minio-java\
  \ versions prior to 8.6.0, XML tag values containing references to system properties or environment\
  \ variables were automatically substituted with their actual values during processing. This\
  \ unintended behavior could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including credentials,\
  \ file paths, or system configuration details, if such references were present in XML content\
  \ from untrusted sources.\n\n#### Affected Versions\n- minio-java < 8.6.0\n\nAll applications\
  \ utilizing affected versions of minio-java for parsing XML with potentially untrusted input\
  \ are vulnerable.\n\n#### Impact\nThis vulnerability poses a high risk of information disclosure.\
  \ Attackers could craft malicious XML inputs to extract sensitive data from the system's properties\
  \ or environment variables, potentially compromising security in applications relying on minio-java\
  \ for object storage operations.\n\n#### Patches\nThe issue is resolved in minio-java version\
  \ 8.6.0 and later. In these versions, automatic substitution of XML tag values with system\
  \ properties or environment variables has been disabled.\n\nUsers are strongly advised to\
  \ upgrade to minio-java 8.6.0 or a newer release to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n#### Workarounds\n\
  No full workarounds exist without upgrading the library. As interim measures:\n\n- Refrain\
  \ from processing XML data from untrusted or external sources.\n- Implement input sanitization\
  \ or validation to detect and remove references to \n  system properties or environment variables\
  \ in XML content."
