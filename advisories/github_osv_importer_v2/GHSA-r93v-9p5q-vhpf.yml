aliases:
  - CVE-2020-35906
summary: |
  futures_task::waker may cause a use-after-free if used on a type that isn't 'static
  Affected versions of the crate did not properly implement a 'static lifetime bound on the waker function. This resulted in a use-after-free if Waker::wake() is called after original data had been dropped.

  The flaw was corrected by adding 'static lifetime bound to the data waker takes.
