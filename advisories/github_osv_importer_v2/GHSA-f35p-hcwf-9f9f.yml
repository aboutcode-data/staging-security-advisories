  TYPO3 Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability
  TYPO3 4.0.x before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1, uses an insufficiently restrictive default fileDenyPattern for Apache, which allows remote attackers to bypass security restrictions and upload configuration files such as .htaccess, or conduct file upload attacks using multiple extensions.
