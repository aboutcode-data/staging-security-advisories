aliases:
  - CVE-2021-21278
summary: |
  Risk of code injection
  ### Impact
  Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues

  ### Patches
  Temporarily removed the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint
  Self-built users should upgrade to 7f1c430 and later as soon as possible
