  - CVE-2016-10691
summary: "windows-seleniumjar downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `windows-seleniumjar`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `windows-seleniumjar`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available\
  \ for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package,\
  \ using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can\
  \ be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network.\
  \ If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability\
  \ are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your\
  \ ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
