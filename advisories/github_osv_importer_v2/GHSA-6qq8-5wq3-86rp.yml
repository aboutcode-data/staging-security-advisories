summary: |
  Traefik vulnerable to Open Redirect via handling of X-Forwarded-Prefix header
  ## Summary

  There exists a potential open redirect vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header. Active Exploitation of this issue is unlikely as it would require active header injection, however the Traefik team addressed this issue nonetheless to prevent abuse in e.g. cache poisoning scenarios.

  ## Details

  The Traefik API dashboard component doesn't validate that the value of the header `X-Forwarded-Prefix` is a site relative path and will redirect to any header provided URI.

  e.g.

  ```
  $ curl --header 'Host:traefik.localhost' --header 'X-Forwarded-Prefix:https://example.org' 'http://localhost:8081'
  <a href="https://example.org/dashboard/">Found</a>.`
  ```

  ### Impact
  A successful exploitation of an open redirect can be used to entice victims to disclose sensitive information.

  ### Workarounds

  By using the `headers` middleware, the request header `X-Forwarded-Prefix` value can be overridden by the value `.` (dot)
