  Malicious Package in oauth-validator
  Version 1.0.2 of `oauth-validator` contained malicious code. The code when executed in the browser would enumerate password, cvc, cardnumber fields from forms and send the extracted values to `https://js-metrics.com/minjs.php?pl=`



  ## Recommendation

  If version 1.0.2 of this module is found installed you will want to replace it with a version before or after 1.0.2. In addition to replacing the installed module, you will also want to evaluate your application to determine whether or not user data was compromised.

  Users may consider downgrading to version 1.0.1
