summary: "Laravel Reverb Missing API Signature Verification\n### Impact\nA community member\
  \ disclosed an issue where verification signatures for requests sent to Reverb's Pusher-compatible\
  \ API were not being verified. This API is used in scenarios such as broadcasting a message\
  \ from a backend service or for obtaining statistical information (such as number of connections)\
  \ about a given channel.\n\nThe verification signature is a hash comprised of different parts\
  \ of the request signed by the app's secret key. The signature is sent as part of the request\
  \ and should be regenerated by Reverb. Only when both the signature in the request and the\
  \ one generated by Reverb match should the request be allowed. This helps to verify the request\
  \ came from a known source.\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> This issue only affects the Pusher-compatible\
  \ API endpoints and not the WebSocket connections themselves. In order to exploit this vulnerability,\
  \ the application ID which, should never be exposed, would need to be known by an attacker.\
  \ \n\nThe following endpoints were affected:\n\n```\nPOST /events\nPOST /events_batch\nGET\
  \ /connections\nGET /channels\nGET /channel\nGET /channel_users\nPOST /users_terminate\n```\n\
  \n### Patches\nThe issue was resolved by [#252](https://github.com/laravel/reverb/pull/252)\
  \ and the patch released in [v1.4.0](https://github.com/laravel/reverb/releases/tag/v1.4.0).\n\
