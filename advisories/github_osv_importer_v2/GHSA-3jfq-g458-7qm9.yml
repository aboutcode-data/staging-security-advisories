summary: "Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite due to insufficient absolute path sanitization\n\
  ### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\
  \n`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into\
  \ relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping\
  \ the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example\
  \ `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient\
  \ when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar`\
  \ would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with\
  \ repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve\
  \ to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\
  \n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw)\
  \ affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address\
  \ CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry`\
  \ method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with\
  \ absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n\
  \  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  // either add this function...\n  onentry: (entry) => {\n    if\
  \ (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)\n\
  \      entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)\n    }\n  },\n\n  // or this one\n  filter:\
  \ (file, entry) => {\n    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      return false\n    } else\
  \ {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest\
  \ patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves."
