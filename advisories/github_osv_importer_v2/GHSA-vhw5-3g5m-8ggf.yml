  - CVE-2026-24052
summary: "Claude Code has a Domain Validation Bypass which Allows Automatic Requests to Attacker-Controlled\
  \ Domains\nClaude Code contained insufficient URL validation in its trusted domain verification\
  \ mechanism for WebFetch requests. The application used a `startsWith()` function to validate\
  \ trusted domains (e.g., `docs.python.org`, `modelcontextprotocol.io`), this could have enabled\
  \ attackers to register domains like `modelcontextprotocol.io.example.com` that would pass\
  \ validation. This could enable automatic requests to attacker-controlled domains without\
  \ user consent, potentially leading to data exfiltration. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code\
  \ auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised\
  \ to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to hackerone.com/47sid-praetorian for reporting\
  \ this issue!"
