summary: "svg-sanitizer has Cross-site Scripting Bypass\n### Update\nIn [#88](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/issues/88)\
  \ we have determined that the bypass this security advisory was created for, was a false positive\
  \ and as such we have requested that the CVE be rejected.\n\n___\n\nA bypass has been found\
  \ that allows an attacker to upload an SVG with persistent XSS.\n\nHTML elements within CDATA\
  \ needed to be sanitized correctly, as we were converting them to a textnode and therefore,\
  \ the library wasn't seeing them as DOM elements.\n\nAny data within a CDATA node will now\
  \ be sanitised using [HTMLPurifier](https://github.com/ezyang/htmlpurifier). We've also removed\
  \ many of the HTML and MathML elements from the allowed element list, as without `ForiegnObject`,\
  \ they're not legal within the SVG context. \n\nAdditional tests have been added to the test\
  \ suite to account for these new bypasses.\n\n### Impact\nThis impacts all users of the `svg-sanitizer`\
  \ library.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is fixed in 0.16.0 and higher.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  There is currently no workaround available without upgrading.\n\n### For more information\n\
