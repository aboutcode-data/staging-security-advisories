  - CVE-2023-28444
summary: |
  angular-server-side-configuration information disclosure vulnerability in monorepo with node.js backend
  ### Impact
  angular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory.
  During deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file).

  With version 15 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html.

  This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component.

  ### Patches
  Vulnerability has been mitigated in 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default.

  ```bash
  # Update via npm
  npm update angular-server-side-configuration
  ## Or more specific
  npm install angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0

  # Update via pnpm
  pnpm update angular-server-side-configuration
  ## Or more specific
  pnpm add angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0

  # Update via yarn
  yarn update angular-server-side-configuration
  ## Or more specific
  yarn add angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0
  ```

  ### Workarounds
  Manually edit or create ngssc.json or run a script after ngssc.json generation
