  Symfony2 security issue when the trust proxy mode is enabled
  An application is vulnerable if it uses the client IP address as returned by the Request::getClientIp() method for sensitive decisions like IP based access control.

  To fix this security issue, the following changes have been made to all versions of Symfony2:

  A new Request::setTrustedProxies() method has been introduced and should be used intead of Request::trustProxyData() to enable the trust proxy mode. It takes an array of trusted proxy IP addresses as its argument:
  ```
  // before (probably in your front controller script)
  Request::trustProxyData();

  // after
  Request::setTrustedProxies(array('1.1.1.1'));
  // 1.1.1.1 being the IP address of a trusted reverse proxy
  ```
  The Request::trustProxyData() method has been deprecated (when used, it automatically trusts the latest proxy in the chain -- which is the current remote address):
  ```
  Request::trustProxyData();

  // is equivalent to
  Request::setTrustedProxies(array($request->server->get('REMOTE_ADDR')));
  ```
  We encourage all Symfony2 users to upgrade as soon as possible. It you don't want to upgrade to the latest version yet, you can also apply the following patches:

  - [Patch](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/fc89d6b...9ce892c.patch) for Symfony 2.0.19
  - [Patch](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/compare/922c201...e5536f0.patch) for Symfony 2.1.4
