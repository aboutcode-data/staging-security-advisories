  Yeswiki Vulnerable to Authenticated Reflected Cross-site Scripting
  ### Summary
  **Vulnerable Version:** Yeswiki < v4.5.4
  **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/?PagePrincipale%2Fdeletepage`
  **Vulnerable Parameter:** `incomingurl`
  **Payload:** `"><script>alert(1)</script>`

  ### Details
  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

  ### PoC
  **NOTE:** This vulnerability requires admin access.
  1. Visit the endpoint as mentioned below and see that an alert box pops up:

     **URL with Payload:** `https://yeswiki.net/?PagePrincipale%2Fdeletepage&incomingurl="><script>alert(1)</script>`

  ### Impact
  An attacker can use a reflected cross-site scripting attack to steal cookies from an authenticated user by having them click on a malicious link. Stolen cookies allow the attacker to take over the user’s session. This vulnerability may also allow attackers to deface the website or embed malicious content.
