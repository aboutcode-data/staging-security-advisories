  UNEDITABLE_SCHEMAS and UNEDITABLE_TABLE_DESCRIPTION_MATCH_RULES not respected by frontend service backend
  ### Impact
  Any install that has `UNEDITABLE_SCHEMAS` and/or `UNEDITABLE_TABLE_DESCRIPTION_MATCH_RULES` set in the front-end, is being impacted. The value of these properties is ignored if set, allowing any user to modify table and column descriptions, even though the properties imply they shouldn't be.

  ### Patches
  There is an attached PR that applies this restriction on the back-end.

  ### Workarounds
  N/A

  ### References

  ### More details
  Summary: I believe that UNEDITABLE_SCHEMAS and
  UNEDITABLE_TABLE_DESCRIPTION_MATCH_RULES are only being applied on the
  front-end, not on the frontend service back-end, allowing any user to
  modify table and column descriptions even if this configuration parameter
  is set.

  Repro steps:

  1. docker-compose -f docker-amundsen.yml up neo4j elasticsearch
  amundsensearch amundsenmetadata
  2. python example/scripts/sample_data_loader.py
  3. FRONTEND_SVC_CONFIG_MODULE_CLASS=amundsen_application.config.TestConfig
  PYTHONPATH=. python3 amundsen_application/wsgi.py
  4. Attempt a modification to a table description:

  curl '<http://localhost:5000/api/metadata/v0/put_table_description>' \\\\
  -X 'PUT' \\\\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \\\\
  --data-binary '{"description":"2t test table","key":"hive://gold.test_schema/test_table1","source":"user"}'
  {"msg":"Success"}



  5. This correctly succeeds, which can be validated by GETing the info:

  curl '<http://localhost:5000/api/metadata/v0/get_table_description?key=hive://gold.test_schema/test_table1>'
  {"description":"1st test table","msg":"Success"}


  At this point, modify TestConfig inside config.py to add this line: UNEDITABLE_SCHEMAS
  = set(['test_schema'])

  You can now re-run step 4, and step 5 with different data, and confirm
  that the modification has persisted. If you build and run the UI, you can
  see that on the page
  <http://localhost:5000/table_detail/gold/hive/test_schema/test_table1>
  http://localhost:5000/table_detail/gold/hive/test_schema/test_table1, the
  inline editor is correctly disabled.

  Looking at
  amundsenfrontendlibrary/amundsen_application/api/metadata/v0.py:268
  put_table_description, you can see there's no reference to
  UNEDITABLE_SCHEMAS or UNEDITABLE_TABLE_DESCRIPTION_MATCH_RULES.

  The only place I can find these referenced is in
  amundsenfrontendlibrary/amundsen_application/api/utils/metadata_utils.py:marshall_table_full,
  which would explain why the UI is correctly respecting this setting.

  If this is correct, put_column_description would also be similarly
  affected.

  I believe the correct fix for all of these methods is to load the table,
  run it through marshall_dashboard_partial to fully evaluate what's
  editable or not (to reuse the same code path for FE and back-end), and
  reject the response if it's not editable. I'll implement a fix along these
  lines once someone confirms this.
