aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34708
summary: |
  Directus allows redacted data extraction on the API through "alias"
  ## Summary
  A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API.
  Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field.

  ## Steps to reproduce
  - Set up a simple role with read-access to users.
  - Create a new user with the role from the previous step
  - Assign a password to the user

  The easiest way to confirm this vulnerability is by first visiting `/users/me`. You should be presented with a redacted JSON-object.
  Next, visit `/users/me?alias[hash]=password`. This time, the returned JSON object will included the raw password hash instead of the redacted value.

  ## Workaround
  This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them.
