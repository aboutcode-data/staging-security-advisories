  - CVE-2024-21516
summary: "Cross site scripting in opencart\nThis affects versions of the package opencart/opencart\
  \ from 4.0.0.0. A reflected XSS issue was identified in the directory parameter of admin common/filemanager.list\
  \ route. An attacker could obtain a user's token by tricking the user to click on a maliciously\
  \ crafted URL. The user is then prompted to login and redirected again upon authentication\
  \ with the payload automatically executing. If the attacked user has admin privileges, this\
  \ vulnerability could be used as the start of a chain of exploits like Zip Slip or arbitrary\
  \ file write vulnerabilities in the admin functionality. \n\n**Notes:**\n\n1) This is only\
  \ exploitable if the attacker knows the name or path of the admin directory. The name of the\
  \ directory is \"admin\" by default but there is a pop-up in the dashboard warning users to\
  \ rename it.\n\n2) The fix for this vulnerability is incomplete. The redirect is removed so\
  \ that it is not possible for an attacker to control the redirect post admin login anymore,\
  \ but it is still possible to exploit this issue in admin if the user is authenticated as\
  \ an admin already."
