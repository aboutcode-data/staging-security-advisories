  Remote Code Execution in Red Discord Bot
  ### Impact
  A RCE exploit has been discovered in the Trivia module: this exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted usernames to inject code into the Trivia module's leaderboard command. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information.

  ### Patches
  This critical exploit has been fixed on version 3.3.11.

  ### Workarounds
  Unloading the Trivia module with ``unload trivia`` can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to 3.3.11 to completely patch this issue.
