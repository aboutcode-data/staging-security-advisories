aliases:
  - CVE-2024-35180
summary: |
  OMERO.web must check that the JSONP callback is a valid function
  ### Background

  There is currently no escaping or validation of the `callback` parameter that can be passed to various OMERO.web endpoints that have JSONP enabled. One such endpoint is `/webclient/imgData/...`. As we only really use these endpoints with jQuery's own callback name generation [^1] it is quite difficult or even impossible to exploit this in vanilla OMERO.web. However, these metadata endpoints are likely to be used by many plugins.

  ### Impact
  OMERO.web before 5.25.0

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to 5.26.0 or higher
  ### Workarounds

  None
