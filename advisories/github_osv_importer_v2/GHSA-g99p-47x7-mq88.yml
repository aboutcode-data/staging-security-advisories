summary: "go-f3 module vulnerable to integer overflow leading to panic\n### Impact\n\nFilecoin\
  \ nodes consuming F3 messages are vulnerable.  go-f3 panics when it validates a \"poison\"\
  \ messages.  A \"poison\" message can can cause integer overflow in the signer index validation.\
  \  In Lotus' case, the whole node will crash.  \n\nThere is no barrier to entry.  An attacker\
  \ doesn't need any power to pull off this attack.\n\nThese malicious messages aren't self-propagating\
  \ since the bug is in the validator.  An attacker needs to directly send the message to all\
  \ targets.\n\n\n\n### Patches\nThe fix was merged and released with go-f3 0.8.7.  All node\
  \ software (Lotus, Forest, Venus) are using a patched version of go-f3 with their updates\
  \ for the nv27 network upgrade.\n\ngo-f3 now does proper overflow checking using `math.MaxInt64`\
  \ comparison and returns error `\"justificationPower overflow\"` when overflow would occur.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nThe are no immediate workarounds available.  Nodes should upgrade to the\
  \ patched version, which they will have done if participating in nv27 on Filecoin mainnet.\n\
  \n### Credits\nThe initial finding(unrelated path) was reported by [0xNirix](https://github.com/0xNirix)\
  \ via bug bounty program which wasn't high issue. The further digging by developers led to\
  \ this finding. Thank you for the contributions."
