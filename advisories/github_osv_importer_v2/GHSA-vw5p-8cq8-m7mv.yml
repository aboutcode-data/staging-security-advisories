aliases:
  - CVE-2026-22774
summary: |
  Devalue is vulnerable to denial of service due to memory exhaustion in devalue.parse
  ## Summary

  Certain inputs can cause `devalue.parse` to consume excessive CPU time and/or memory, potentially leading to denial of service in systems that parse input from untrusted sources. This affects applications using `devalue.parse` on externally-supplied data. The root cause is the typed array hydration expecting an `ArrayBuffer` as input, but not checking the assumption before creating the typed array.

  ## Details

  The parser's typed array hydration logic does not properly validate input before processing. Specially crafted inputs can cause disproportionate memory allocation or CPU usage on the receiving system.

  ## Impact

  This is a denial of service vulnerability affecting systems that use `devalue.parse` to handle data from potentially untrusted sources.

  Affected systems should upgrade to patched versions immediately.
