summary: "agent-js: Insecure Key Generation in `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate`\n## Impact\n\n\
  The library offers a function to generate an ed25519 key pair via `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate`\
  \ with an optional param to provide a 32 byte seed value, which will then be used as the secret\
  \ key. **When no seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the secret\
  \ key using secure randomness**. However, a recent change **broke this guarantee** and **uses\
  \ an insecure seed for key pair generation**.\n\nSince the private key of this identity (`535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`)\
  \ is compromised, one could lose funds associated with the principal on ledgers or lose access\
  \ to a canister where this principal is the controller. Users are asked to take proactive\
  \ measures mentioned below in Workarounds:Users to protect their assets. \n\n## Patches\n\
  Patch for the vulnerability is **available in v1.0.1** for all the packages listed in the\
  \ advisory. Please upgrade and deploy your canisters immediately. \n\n## Workarounds\n\n###\
  \ Developers\n\nThe recommended fix is to upgrade the package to the patched version. If that\
  \ is not possible, there are couple of workarounds to handle the insecure key generation.\n\
  \n1. Invoking the function as `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate(null)` would fix the broken conditional\
  \ evaluation and force the function to generate a securely random seed. However, this is not\
  \ guaranteed to work for future upgrades.\n2. Passing a securely generated randomness as a\
  \ seed to `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate` would force the library to use it as the seed to generate\
  \ the key pair.\n\n### Users\n\n#### Removing a controller of a canister if it's the affected\
  \ principal\n\nFor all canisters you control, fetch the controllers of the canisters using\
  \ \n```sh\ndfx canister info --ic <CANISTER>\n```\nIf you see the principal `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`\
  \ as one of the controllers, follow the steps below \n```sh\ndfx identity whoami # record\
  \ CURRENT_IDENTITY\n\ndfx identity new <NEW_IDENTITY_NAME> \ndfx identity use <NEW_IDENTITY_NAME>\
  \ \ndfx identity get-principal <NEW_IDENTITY_NAME> # record NEW_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL\n\ndfx\
  \ identity use <CURRENT_IDENTITY>\ndfx canister update-settings --ic <CANISTER> --add-controller\
  \ <NEW_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL>\ndfx canister update-settings --ic <CANISTER> --remove-controller\
  \ `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`\n```\nFor more details\
  \ on canister management, please visit [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters)\n\
  \n#### Checking funds on wallets /  ledgers\n\nIf you have funds on ledgers using a browser\
  \ wallet, please check if the account principal matches `535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe`.\
  \ If it does, please create a new account and transfer the funds to the new account immediately.\n\
