summary: |
  Username spoofing in OnionShare
  Between September 26, 2021 and October 8, 2021, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) conducted a penetration test of OnionShare 2.4, funded by the Open Technology Fund's [Red Team lab](https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/). This is an issue from that penetration test.

  - Vulnerability ID: OTF-005
  - Vulnerability type: Improper Input Sanitization
  - Threat level: Low

  ## Description:

  It is possible to change the username to that of another chat participant with an additional space character at the end of the name string.

  ## Technical description:

  Assumed users in Chat:

  - Alice
  - Bob
  - Mallory

  1. Mallory renames to `Alice `.
  2. Mallory sends message as `Alice `.
  3. Alice and Bob receive a message from Mallory disguised as `Alice `, which is hard to distinguish from the `Alice`
  in the web interface.

  Other (invisible) whitespace characters were found to be working as well.

  ## Impact:

  An adversary with access to the chat environment can use the rename feature to impersonate other participants by adding whitespace characters at the end of the username.

  ## Recommendation:

  - Remove non-visible characters from the username
