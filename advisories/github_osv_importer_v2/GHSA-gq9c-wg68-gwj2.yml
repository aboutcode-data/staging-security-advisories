  OpenClaw has a path traversal in browser trace/download output paths may allow arbitrary file writes
  ## Summary

    OpenClaw’s browser control API accepted user-supplied output paths for trace/download files without consistently
    constraining writes to OpenClaw-managed temporary directories.

    ## Impact

    If an attacker can access the browser control API, they could attempt to write trace/download output files outside
    intended temp roots, depending on process filesystem permissions.

    ## Affected versions

    `openclaw` `< 2026.2.13`

    ## Fixed versions

    `openclaw` `>= 2026.2.13`

    ## Remediation

    Upgrade to `2026.2.13` or later.

    ## What changed

    The fix constrains output paths for:

    - `POST /trace/stop`
    - `POST /wait/download`
    - `POST /download`

    All three now enforce OpenClaw temp-root boundaries and reject traversal/escape paths.

    ## Credits

    Thanks to Adnan Jakati (@jackhax) of Praetorian for responsible disclosure.

    Fix shipped in PR #15652 and merged to `main` on February 13, 2026 (`7f0489e4731c8d965d78d6eac4a60312e46a9426`).

  Fix commit 7f0489e4731c8d965d78d6eac4a60312e46a9426 confirmed on main and in v2026.2.14. Upgrade to `openclaw >= 2026.2.13`.
