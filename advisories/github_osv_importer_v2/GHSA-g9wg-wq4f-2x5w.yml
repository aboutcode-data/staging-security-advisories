  Cross-Site Scripting in console-feed
  Versions of `console-feed` prior to 2.8.10 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to properly escape the rendered output. If an application uses `console-feed` and a malicious JavaScript payload was passed to a `console.log('%_', payload)` call, the package would render HTML containing the malicious payload.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.8.10 or later.
