summary: |
  express-xss-sanitizer has an unbounded recursion depth
  # Security Advisory: express-xss-sanitizer

  ## Overview
  A vulnerability was discovered in express-xss-sanitizer that allowed unbounded recursion depth during sanitization of nested objects.

  ## Affected Versions
  - All versions prior to 2.0.1

  ## Patched Versions
  - 2.0.1 and later

  ## Description
  The sanitize function in lib/sanitize.js performed recursive sanitization without depth limiting, making it vulnerable to stack overflow attacks via specially crafted deeply nested JSON objects.

  ## Impact
  An attacker could cause denial-of-service by sending a request with deeply nested structures, potentially crashing the Node.js process.

  ## Solution
  Upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later:

  ```bash
  npm install express-xss-sanitizer@latest
  ```
