summary: |
  Remote Code Execution in create_conda_env function in lollms
  A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the create_conda_env function of the parisneo/lollms repository. The vulnerability arises from the use of shell=True in the subprocess.Popen function, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the env_name and python_version parameters. This issue could lead to a serious security breach as demonstrated by the ability to execute the 'whoami' command among potentially other harmful commands.
