  propel/propel1 SQL injection possible with limit() on MySQL
  The limit() query method is susceptible to catastrophic SQL injection with MySQL.

  For example, given a model User for a table users:
  ```
  UserQuery::create()->limit('1;DROP TABLE users')->find();
  ```
  This will drop the users table!

  The cause appears to be a lack of integer casting of the limit input in either Criteria::setLimit() or in DBMySQL::applyLimit(). The code comments there seem to imply that casting was avoided due to overflow issues with 32-bit integers.

  This is surprising behavior since one of the primary purposes of an ORM is to prevent basic SQL injection.

  This affects all versions of Propel: 1.x, 2.x, and 3.
