  Babylon's BIP322 signature implementation is not fully compliant to the spec
  ### Summary

  The BIP-322 signature verification does not enforce the SIGHASH value to be SIGHASH_ALL, and therefore is not strictly following the [spec](https://bips.dev/322/).

  ### Impact

  Non-compliant BIP-322 signatures in proof of possessions can be accepted by the chain.
