summary: "nova-tiptap has Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability\nA vulnerability\
  \ was discovered in the marshmallow-packages/nova-tiptap Laravel Nova package that allows\
  \ unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files to any Laravel disk configured in the application.\n\
  \nThe vulnerability is due to:\n\t•\tMissing authentication middleware (Nova and Nova.Auth)\
  \ on the /nova-tiptap/api/file upload endpoint\n\t•\tLack of validation on uploaded files\
  \ (no MIME/type or extension restrictions)\n\t•\tAbility for an attacker to choose the disk\
  \ parameter dynamically\n\nThis means an attacker can craft a custom form and send a POST\
  \ request to /nova-tiptap/api/file, supplying a valid CSRF token, and upload executable or\
  \ malicious files (e.g., .php, binaries) to public disks such as local, public, or s3. If\
  \ a publicly accessible storage path is used (e.g. S3 with public access, or Laravel’s public\
  \ disk), the attacker may gain the ability to execute or distribute arbitrary files — amounting\
  \ to a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector in some environments."
