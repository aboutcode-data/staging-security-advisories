summary: "Garbage collection issue in BC-FJA in Java 13 and later\nAn issue was discovered in\
  \ the FIPS Java API of Bouncy Castle BC-FJA before 1.0.2.4. Changes to the JVM garbage collector\
  \ in Java 13 and later trigger an issue in the BC-FJA FIPS modules where it is possible for\
  \ temporary keys used by the module to be zeroed out while still in use by the module, resulting\
  \ in errors or potential information loss. \n\nNOTE: FIPS compliant users are unaffected because\
  \ the FIPS certification is only for Java 7, 8, and 11."
