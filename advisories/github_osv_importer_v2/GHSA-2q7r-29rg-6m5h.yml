summary: |
  fastify-reply-from affected by bypass of reply forwarding
  ### Summary
  By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker could access routes that are not allowed, even though the `reply.from` is defined for specific routes in `@fastify/reply-from`.

  ### Details

  An attacker can bypass the route defined by the `@fastify/reply-from` package by adding a `..` symbol, which, for `curl` version `8.7.1`, is `%2e%2e`.

  ### Impact

  Everyone is using this package with the routes option to protect a 3rd-party resource.
