  Withdrawn Advisory: Netty-handler does not validate host names by default
  ## Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because the underlying vulnerability only concerns Red Hat's Hot Rod client, which is not in one of the GitHub Advisory Database's [supported ecosystems](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/README.md#supported-ecosystems). This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Netty-handler has been found to no validate hostnames when using TLS in its default configuration. As a result netty-handler is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Users would need to set the protocol to "HTTPS" in the SSLParameters of the SSLEngine to opt in to host name validation. A change in default behavior is expected in the `5.x` release branch with no backport planned.

  In the interim users are advised to enable host name validation in their configurations.
  See https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8537 for details on the forthcoming change in default behavior.
