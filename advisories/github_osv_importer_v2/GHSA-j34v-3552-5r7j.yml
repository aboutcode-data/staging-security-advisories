  Multiple security issues in Pomerium's embedded envoy
  Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, has issued multiple CVEs impacting stability and security.

  Though Pomerium may not be vulnerable to all of the issues, it is recommended that all users upgrade to Pomerium v0.16.4 as soon as possible to minimize risk.

  ### Impact

  - Possible DoS or crash
  - Resources available to unauthorized users
  - Pomerium may trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted

  ### Patches
  Patched in v0.16.4

  ### Workarounds
  No
