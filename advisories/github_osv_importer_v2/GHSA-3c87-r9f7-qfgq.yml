  - CVE-2016-10623
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in macaca-chromedriver-zxa\nAffected versions of `macaca-chromedriver-zxa`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `macaca-chromedriver-zxa`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe best mitigation is to manually\
  \ set the download URL to a safe HTTPS server via the `CHROMEDRIVER_CDNURL` environment variable.\n\
  \nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is\
  \ not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private\
  \ network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised\
  \ your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors\
  \ or Rogue ISP Employees."
