  - CVE-2020-11055
summary: "Cross-Site Scripting in BookStack\n### Impact\n\nA user with permission to create\
  \ comments could POST HTML directly to the system to be saved in a comment, which would then\
  \ be executed/displayed to others users viewing the comment. Through this vulnerability custom\
  \ JavaScript code could be injected and therefore ran on other user machines.\n\nThis most\
  \ impacts scenarios where not-trusted users are given permission to create comments.\n\n###\
  \ Patches\n\nThe issue was addressed in BookStack v0.29.2.\n\nAfter upgrading, The command\
  \ `php artisan bookstack:regenerate-comment-content` should be ran to remove any pre-existing\
  \ dangerous content. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nComments can be disabled in the system settings\
  \ to prevent them being shown to users. Alternatively, comment creation permissions can be\
  \ altered as required to only those who are trusted but this will not address existing exploitation\
  \ of this vulnerability. \n\n### References\n\n* [BookStack Beta v0.29.2](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.29.2)\n\
