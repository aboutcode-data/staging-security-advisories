  - CVE-2018-17107
summary: "tgstation-server cached user logins in legacy server\nPlease note this advisory is\
  \ for a historical preexisting issue in the legacy server from 2018. It has long since been\
  \ triaged. It is being moved here for visibility. The text below is copied from the original\
  \ issue #690\n\n# You can login to the server with any username/password combination if someone\
  \ else is logged in\n\nAn explanation of the bug: Back in 3.2.1.0, in order to accommodate\
  \ running the Control Panel using Mono some hooks were added to the WCF communication layer.\
  \ Detailed in this commit: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/commit/2894ea03d708c7f16bab47ba5020c2ad4c3d5554#diff-0ba090ea7073a3a304dfdbdfc512f733\
  \ \n\nThe bug was in this line: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/commit/2894ea03d708c7f16bab47ba5020c2ad4c3d5554#diff-0ba090ea7073a3a304dfdbdfc512f733R48\n\
  authPolicy is passed in by the framework but the documentation for what the parameter is is\
  \ virtually non-existent: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.serviceauthenticationmanager.authenticate?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_ServiceModel_ServiceAuthenticationManager_Authenticate_System_Collections_ObjectModel_ReadOnlyCollection_System_IdentityModel_Policy_IAuthorizationPolicy__System_Uri_System_ServiceModel_Channels_Message__\n\
  \nTurns out it is a cache of what the previously returned policy was, as Floyd thankfully\
  \ found out for us. The security patch fixes the issue by creating a new empty list as the\
  \ return value when password authentication fails as opposed to using the authPolicy parameter.\n\
  \nIf you're wondering why this line: https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/commit/2894ea03d708c7f16bab47ba5020c2ad4c3d5554#diff-0ba090ea7073a3a304dfdbdfc512f733R42\
  \ didn't prevent the issue. It only invalidated the actual Windows login session, but in the\
  \ eyes of the server the user was still valid since we just passed that closed handle as a\
  \ return result. Had access to static files been attempted with a bad login, the request would\
  \ end up erroring due to trying to impersonate using a closed user token handle.\n\nThis has\
  \ been fixed in 1812a9c6793c8516c138a105ccfb2108164f0eff and versions 3.2.5.0+"
