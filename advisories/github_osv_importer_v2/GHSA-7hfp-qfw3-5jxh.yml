summary: "Helm Vulnerable to denial of service through string value parsing\nFuzz testing, by\
  \ Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the `_strvals_` package\
  \ that can cause an out of memory panic. Out of memory panics cannot be recovered from. Applications\
  \ that use functions from the `_strvals_` package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service\
  \ attack when they use this package and it panics.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `_strvals_` package\
  \ contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has\
  \ command line flags like `--set`, `--set-string`, and others that enable the user to pass\
  \ in strings that are merged into the values. The `_strvals_` package converts these strings\
  \ into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to\
  \ be created causing an out of memory panic.\n\nApplications that use the `_strvals_` package\
  \ in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input\
  \ causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\n\nThe Helm Client will panic with input to\
  \ `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic.\
  \ Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm\
  \ client.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.9.4. \n\n### Workarounds\n\n\
  SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant\
  \ memory usage before passing them to the `_strvals_` functions.\n\n### For more information\n\
  \nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ document.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF."
