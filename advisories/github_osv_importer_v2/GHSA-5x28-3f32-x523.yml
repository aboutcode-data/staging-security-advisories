summary: "Drupal core Access control bypass\nThe Media Library module has a security vulnerability\
  \ whereby it doesn't sufficiently restrict access to media items in certain configurations.\n\
  \n### Solution: \nIf you are using Drupal 8.7.x, you should upgrade to Drupal 8.7.11.\nIf\
  \ you are using Drupal 8.8.x, you should upgrade to Drupal 8.8.1.\nVersions of Drupal 8 prior\
  \ to 8.7.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage.\n\nAlternatively, you may\
  \ mitigate this vulnerability by unchecking the \"Enable advanced UI\" checkbox on `/admin/config/media/media-library`.\
  \ (This mitigation is not available in 8.7.x.)"
