summary: |
  Freeform Craft Plugin CP UI (builder/integrations) has Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue
  **Summary**
  An authenticated, low-privilege user (able to create/edit forms) can inject arbitrary HTML/JS into the Craft Control Panel (CP) builder and integrations views. User-controlled form labels and integration metadata are rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization, leading to stored XSS that executes when any admin views the builder/integration screens.

  **Affected Product**
  - Ecosystem: Packagist (Craft CMS plugin)
  - Package: solspace/craft-freeform
  - Version: <= 5.14.6 (latest observed). Likely all 5.x until patched.

  **Details**
  - Root cause: Multiple user-controlled strings (field labels, section labels, integration icons, short names, WYSIWYG previews) are injected into React components using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization.
  - Evidence: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on user-controlled properties in bundled CP JS at [packages/plugin/src/Resources/js/client/client.js](packages/plugin/src/Resources/js/client/client.js#L1).

  **PoCs**
  - Label-based XSS:
    1. In Craft CP, create/edit a Freeform field and set its label to `<img src=x onerror="alert('xss-label')">`.
    2. Open the form builder view containing the field.
    3. Alert executes (stored XSS).
  - Integration icon SVG:
    1. Set an integration "icon SVG" to `<svg><script>alert('xss-icon')</script></svg>`.
    2. Open the integrations CP view.
    3. Script executes.

  **Impact**
  Arbitrary JS in admin CP; session/CSRF token theft; potential full admin takeover via DOM-driven actions.

  **Remediation**
  - Sanitize/HTML-encode all user-controlled strings before passing to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or avoid it for labels/titles/icons.
  - Server-side: strip/escape disallowed tags on save for fields, integration metadata, WYSIWYG content.
  - Add regression tests with `<img onerror>` payloads to ensure no execution in builder/integration views.

  **Workarounds**
  - Restrict form-edit permissions to trusted admins only until patched.
  - Consider CSP that disallows inline scripts (defense-in-depth only).
