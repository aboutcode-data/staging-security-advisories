  CSRF Vulnerability in polaris-website
  ### Impact
  CSRF vulnerability:
  In some very specific circumstances, an attacker would be able to update your settings.
  Basically you would need to navigate to hackersite.com while logged into our panel. Then they could modify your settings. They couldn't check if it worked, nor could they read your settings.

  ### Patches
  As of v1.1.1 this has been patched by implementing the Double submit pattern using a cookie.
