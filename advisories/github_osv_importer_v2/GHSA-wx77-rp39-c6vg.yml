  Regular Expression Denial of Service in markdown
  All versions of `markdown` are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The `markdown.toHTML()` function has significantly degraded performance when parsing long strings containing underscores. This may lead to Denial of Service if the parser accepts user input.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
