summary: "Allure Report allows Improper XXE Restriction via DocumentBuilderFactory\n### Summary\n\
  A critical XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the xunit-xml-plugin used by\
  \ Allure 2. The plugin fails to securely configure the XML parser (`DocumentBuilderFactory`)\
  \ and allows external entity expansion when processing test result .xml files. This allows\
  \ attackers to read arbitrary files from the file system and potentially trigger server-side\
  \ request forgery (SSRF).\n\n### Details\nIn `\\allure2-main\\plugins\\xunit-xml-plugin\\\
  src\\main\\java\\io\\qameta\\allure\\xunitxml\\XunitXmlPlugin.java` the application uses `DocumentBuilderFactory`\
  \ without disabling DTDs or external entities. By generating a report with a malicious xml\
  \ file within it, an attacker can perform XXE to leverage SSRF, or to read system files.\n\
  \n### PoC\nTo recreate this vulnerability, you need to install allure for command-line (In\
  \ my POC I used a Windows 11 Machine). \n\n1. Create a folder called `allure`, and within\
  \ it, create a malicious XML file. I will attach my SSRF and file reading payloads, however,\
  \ for the rest of the POC, I will focus on reading system files for better screenshots.\n\
  ##SSRF (replace webhook link with your own)\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1a9a438-b6f1-4675-973f-a43847a84519)\n\
  \n##Reading System Files\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb0e1e60-1f76-42e7-b68d-2137bed62fe9)\n\
  \n2. Put the malicious .xml file into the `allure` directory created previously\n3. Run the\
  \ following command to run the report `allure generate C:\\path\\to\\directory\\allure -o\
  \ report --clean`\n4. To view and confirm the executed payload, run `allure open report`\n\
  5. When the report opens, confirm the payload executedby going to `Categories > Product defects\
  \ > <payload response>`\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7244550-2e9f-4066-b282-86f1eb8cf5e4)\n\
  \n\n\n### Impact\nThe explained XXE vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary File Disclosure and\
  \ Server-Side Request Forgery. This exploitation can also be carried out silently, meaning\
  \ it can be carried out without user interaction if the tool is automated within an application,\
  \ and can go undetected with a carefully crafted payload. This could allow a malicious actor\
  \ to view other source codes which may contain API or product keys, internal application URLs,\
  \ or other secret items. This makes it an especially high risk when ran within a CI/CD platform."
