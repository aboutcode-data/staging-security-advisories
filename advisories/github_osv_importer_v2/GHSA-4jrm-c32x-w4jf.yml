aliases:
  - CVE-2023-0163
summary: |
  convict vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
  ### Impact

  * An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components
  * An attacker can override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash.

  The main use case of Convict is for handling server-side configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random users. So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server. Still a situation can happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.

  ### Patches
  The problem is patched in `convict@6.2.4`. Users should upgrade to `convict@6.2.4`.

  ### Workarounds
  No way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading
