  Denial of Service in http-proxy-agent
  Versions of `http-proxy-agent` before 2.1.0 are vulnerable to denial of service and uninitialized memory leak when unsanitized options are passed to `Buffer`. An attacker may leverage these unsanitized options to consume system resources.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 2.1.0 or later.
