summary: |
  Jenkins AsakusaSatellite Plugin Does not Mask API Keys via Job Configuration Form
  Jenkins AsakusaSatellite Plugin 0.1.1 and earlier stores AsakusaSatellite API keys unencrypted in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

  These API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

  Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
