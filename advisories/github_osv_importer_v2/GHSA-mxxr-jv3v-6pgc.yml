summary: "FastMCP vulnerable to reflected XSS in client's callback page\n### Summary\nWhile\
  \ setting up an oauth client, it was noticed that the callback page hosted by the client during\
  \ the flow embeds user-controlled content without escaping or sanitizing it. This leads to\
  \ a reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability.\n\n### Details\nThe affected code is located\
  \ in *https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/client/oauth_callback.py*, which\
  \ embeds all values passed to the `create_callback_html` function via the `message` parameter\
  \ it into the callback page without escaping them. This can, for example, be abused by calling\
  \ the callback server with an XSS payload inside the `error` GET parameter, the value of which\
  \ will then be inserted into the callback page, causing the execution of attacker-controlled\
  \ JavaScript code in the callback server's origin. Note that besides the `error` parameter,\
  \ other parameters reaching this function are affected too.\n\n### PoC\n1. Setup a simple\
  \ fastmcp client such as this one (the callback server's port was fixated for simplicity):\n\
  \n```\nurl=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp\"\noauth = OAuth(mcp_url=url,callback_port=1337)\n\n\
  async def main():\n    async with Client(url, auth=oauth) as client:\n        await client.ping()\n\
  \        \n        # List available operations\n        tools = await client.list_tools()\n\
  \n        print(f\"tools: {tools}\")\n       \nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n2. Ensure that\
  \ the MCP server located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` supports oauth.\n3. Start the client.\n\
  4. As soon as the callback server has been started, access `http://localhost:1337/callback?error=<img/src/onerror=alert(window.origin)>`\n\
  \nNote that the exploitation could also for example be initiated by a malicious authorization\
  \ server by returning the exploitation URL mentioned before in the `authorization_endpoint`\
  \ field. The client would then automatically open, causing the XSS to trigger immediatly.\n\
  \n### Impact\nThe impact of this XSS vulnerability is the arbitrary JavaScript execution in\
  \ the victim's browser in the callback server's origin."
