summary: |
  electron ASAR Integrity bypass by just modifying the content
  electron's ASAR Integrity can be bypass by modifying the content.

  ### Impact
  This only impacts apps that have the `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and `onlyLoadAppFromAsar` [fuses](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses) enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are unimpacted.

  Specifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.

  ### Fixed Versions
  * `30.0.5`
  * `31.0.0-beta.1`
