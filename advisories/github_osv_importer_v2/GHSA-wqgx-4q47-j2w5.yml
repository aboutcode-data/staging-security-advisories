  Insecure Cryptography Algorithm in parsel
  All versions of `parsel` use an insecure cryptography algorithm. The package uses `aes-256-cbc` without integrity checks, which renders the ciphertext vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks.


  ## Recommendation

  The package is deprecated and will not be updated. Consider using an alternative package.
