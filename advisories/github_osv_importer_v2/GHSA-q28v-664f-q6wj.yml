summary: |
  Indico vulnerability allows attackers to bulk dump user details
  ### Impact
  An endpoint used to display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump basic user details (such as name, affiliation and email) in bulk.

  > [!TIP]
  > If your instance allows everyone to create a user account, and you wish to truly restrict access to these user details, consider restricting user search to managers. You can find details on the newly introduced indico.conf setting [`ALLOW_PUBLIC_USER_SEARCH`](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/config/settings/#ALLOW_PUBLIC_USER_SEARCH) in our documentation.

  ### Patches
  You should to update to [Indico 3.3.7](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.7) as soon as possible.
  See [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.

  ### Workarounds
  It is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the webserver config), but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show the details of the users listed in those fields, so upgrading instead is highly recommended.
