summary: |
  gosaml2 vulnerable to Denial Of Service Via Deflate Decompression Bomb
  ### Impact
  SAML Service Providers using this library for SAML authentication support are likely susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. A bug in this library enables attackers to craft a `deflate`-compressed request which will consume significantly more memory during processing than the size of the original request. This may eventually lead to memory exhaustion and the process being killed.

  ### Mitigation
  The maximum compression ratio achievable with `deflate` is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of bodies passed to gosaml2, limiting the rate and concurrency of calls, and ensuring that lots of memory is available to the process it _may_ be possible to help Go's garbage collector "keep up".

  Implementors are encouraged not to rely on this.

  ### Patches
  This issue is addressed in v0.9.0
