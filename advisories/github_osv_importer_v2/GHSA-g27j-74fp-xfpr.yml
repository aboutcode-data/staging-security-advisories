aliases:
  - CVE-2022-26969
summary: |
  Insecure default value for CORS configuration
  ### Impact

  The default value for the `CORS_ENABLED` and `CORS_ORIGIN` configuration was set to be very permissive by default. This could lead to unauthorized access in uncontrolled environments when the configuration hasn't been changed.

  ### Patches

  The default values for CORS have been changed in https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12022 which is released under 9.7.0

  ### Workarounds

  Configure the CORS environment variables to match your project's usage, rather than leaving them at the (permissive) defaults.
