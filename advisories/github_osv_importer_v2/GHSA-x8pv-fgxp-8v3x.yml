summary: |
  TYPO3 Allows Information Disclosure via DBAL Restriction Handling
  ### Problem
  When performing a database query involving multiple tables through the database abstraction layer (DBAL), frontend user permissions are only applied via `FrontendGroupRestriction` to the last table. As a result, data from additional tables included in the same query may be unintentionally exposed to unauthorized users.

  ### Solution
  Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.51 ELTS, 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12 LTS that fix the problem described.

  ### Credits
  Thanks to Christian Futterlieb for reporting this issue, and to TYPO3 security team member Elias Häußler for fixing it.
