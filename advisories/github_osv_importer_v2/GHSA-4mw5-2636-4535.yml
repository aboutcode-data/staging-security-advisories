  op_panic in the base runtime can force a panic in the runtime's containing thread
  Affected versions use deno_core releases that expose `Deno.core.ops.op_panic` to the JS runtime in the base core

  This function when called triggers a manual panic in the thread containing the runtime, breaking sandboxing

  It can be fixed by stubbing out the exposed op:
  ```javascript
  Deno.core.ops.op_panic = (msg) => { throw new Error(msg) };
  ```
