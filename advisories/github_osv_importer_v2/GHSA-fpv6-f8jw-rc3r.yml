aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41088
summary: |
  Elvish vulnerable to remote code execution via the web UI backend
  ### Impact

  Elvish's backend for the experimental web UI (started by `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the code sent from the web UI.

  The backend does not check the origin of requests correctly. As a result, if the user has the web UI backend open and visits a compromised or malicious website, the website can send arbitrary code to the endpoint in localhost.

  ### Patches

  All Elvish releases since 0.14.0 no longer include the experimental web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a version from source that includes it.

  The issue can be patched for previous versions by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web, depending on the exact version).

  ### Workarounds

  Do not use the experimental web UI.
