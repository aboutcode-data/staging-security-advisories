summary: "OneUptime Vulnerable to a Privilege Escalation via Local Storage Key Manipulation\n\
  ## Summary\nA security vulnerability exists in oneuptime's local storage handling, where a\
  \ regular user can escalate privileges by modifying the `is_master_admin` key to `true`. This\
  \ allows unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.\n\n## Details\nThe vulnerability\
  \ lies in the improper validation of client-side stored data within the web application. Specifically,\
  \ the `is_master_admin` key, stored in the local storage of the browser, can be manipulated\
  \ by an attacker. By changing this key from false to true, the application grants administrative\
  \ privileges to the user, without proper server-side validation. \n\n## POC\n(I am using Firefox\
  \ Developer to demonstrate this vulnerability)\nLog in as a normal user. Open developer tools\
  \ (hit F12), click Storage, then Local Storage. Modify the `is_master_admin` key from `false`\
  \ to `true`.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability represents a high security risk as it allows\
  \ any authenticated user to gain administrative privileges through client-side manipulation.\
  \ Most of the admin previlages were disabled except the user list. Where an attacker could\
  \ see all the list of users who signed up to OneUptome. \n\n\n## Patch\nThis has been patched\
  \ in 7.0.1815"
