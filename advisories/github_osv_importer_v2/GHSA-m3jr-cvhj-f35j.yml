  - CVE-2023-29201
summary: |
  org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml Cross-site Scripting vulnerability
  ### Impact
  The "restricted" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1, only escaped `<script>` and `<style>`-tags but neither attributes that can be used to inject scripts nor other dangerous HTML tags like `<iframe>`. As a consequence, any code relying on this "restricted" mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection ("cross-site scripting"/XSS). An example are anonymous comments in XWiki where the HTML macro filters HTML using restricted mode:

  ```javascript
  {{html}}
  <a href='' onclick='alert(1)'>XSS</a>
  {{/html}}
  ```

  When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance.

  ### Patches
  This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6 RC1 with the introduction of a filter with allowed HTML elements and attributes that is enabled in restricted mode.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.
