  - CVE-2026-25723
summary: "Claude Code Vulnerable to Command Injection via Piped sed Command Bypasses File Write\
  \ Restrictions\nClaude Code failed to properly validate commands using piped sed operations\
  \ with the echo command, allowing attackers to bypass file write restrictions. This vulnerability\
  \ enabled writing to sensitive directories like the .claude folder and paths outside the project\
  \ scope. Exploiting this required the ability to execute commands through Claude Code with\
  \ the \"accept edits\" feature enabled. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update received\
  \ this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest\
  \ version.\n\nClaude Code thanks hackerone.com/nil221 for reporting this issue!"
