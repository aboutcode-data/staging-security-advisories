  ## Advisory FAQ

  ### <a name="how-affected"></a>How do I know if I am affected?

  If you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.

  ### <a name="how-fix"></a>How do I fix the issue?

  * To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.
  * If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.
  * If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;

    Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]

  To install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:
    https://aka.ms/dotnet-download
  ```

  * If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.10 or SDK 7.0.110 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.
  * If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.21 or SDK 6.0.316 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.

  .NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type "Check for updates" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.

  Once you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.

  Additionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.
