summary: |
  OpenClaw has a Web Fetch DoS via unbounded response parsing
  ### Summary
  The `web_fetch` tool could be used to crash the OpenClaw Gateway process (OOM / resource exhaustion) by fetching and attempting to parse attacker-controlled web pages with oversized response bodies or pathological HTML nesting.

  ### Affected Packages / Versions
  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.14`
  - Fixed versions: `>= 2026.2.15`

  ### Impact
  An attacker can social-engineer a user (or any automation that uses `web_fetch`) into fetching a malicious URL that returns extremely large or deeply nested HTML. The Gateway may exhaust memory or become unresponsive, causing a denial of service.

  ### Fix
  The Gateway now caps the downloaded response body size before any HTML parsing and adds additional guards to avoid running Readability/DOM parsing on pathological HTML.

  ### Fix Commit(s)
  - 166cf6a3e04c7df42bea70a7ad5ce2b9df46d147

  ### Release Process Note
  This advisory is prepared for the next npm release. Once `openclaw@2026.2.15` is published, publish this advisory without further edits.
