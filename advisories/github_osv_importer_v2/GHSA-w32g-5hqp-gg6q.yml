  Cross-Site Scripting in mermaid
  Versions of `mermaid` prior to 8.2.3 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. If malicious input  such as `A["<img src=invalid onerror=alert('XSS')></img>"] ` is provided to the application, it will execute the code instead of rendering it as text due to improper output encoding.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 8.2.3 or later
