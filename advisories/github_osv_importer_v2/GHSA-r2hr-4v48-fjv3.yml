  - CVE-2024-34707
summary: |
  Nautobot's BANNER_* configuration can be used to inject arbitrary HTML content into Nautobot pages
  ### Impact

  A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS).

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Patches will be released as part of Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  As [described in the Nautobot documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/administration/configuration/optional-settings/#administratively-configurable-settings), these settings are only configurable through the admin UI of Nautobot if they are *not* explicitly set to some non-empty value in the `nautobot_config.py` or equivalent Nautobot configuration file. Therefore, adding the following configuration to said file completely mitigates this vulnerability in both Nautobot 1.x and 2.x:

  ```python
  BANNER_LOGIN = " "
  BANNER_TOP = " "
  BANNER_BOTTOM = " "
  ```

  or alternately (Nautobot 2.x only), if those variables are not defined explicitly in your configuration file, setting the following environment variables for the Nautobot user account serves the same purpose:

  ```shell
  NAUTOBOT_BANNER_LOGIN=" "
  NAUTOBOT_BANNER_TOP=" "
  NAUTOBOT_BANNER_BOTTOM=" "
  ```

  Limiting all users who do not need elevated privileges to non-admin access (`is_superuser: False` and `is_staff: False`) is a partial mitigation as well.
