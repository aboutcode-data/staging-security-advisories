summary: "Potential CSV Injection vector in OctoberCMS\n### Impact\nAny users with the ability\
  \ to modify any data that could eventually be exported as a CSV file from the `ImportExportController`\
  \ could potentially introduce a CSV injection into the data to cause the generated CSV export\
  \ file to be malicious. This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful\
  \ attack can be completed: \n\n1. Have found a vulnerability in the victim's spreadsheet software\
  \ of choice.\n2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController`\
  \ by a theoretical victim.\n3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it\
  \ in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software.\n\
  \n### Patches\nIssue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466).\n\n### Workarounds\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c84bf03f506052c848f2fddc05f24be631427a1a\
  \ & https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/802d8c8e09a2b342649393edb6d3ceb958851484\
  \ to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 466.\n\n### References\nReported\
  \ by @chrisvidal initially & [Sivanesh Ashok](https://stazot.com/) later.\n\n### For more\
  \ information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n\
  \n### Threat assessment:\nGiven the number of hoops that a potential attacker would have to\
  \ jump through, this vulnerability really boils down to the possibility of abusing the trust\
  \ that a user may have in the export functionality of the project. Thus, this has been rated\
  \ low severity as it requires vulnerabilities to also exist in other software used by any\
  \ potential victims as well as successful social engineering attacks."
