  Data Leakage Vulnerability in livewire/livewire
  livewire/livewire versions greater than 2.2.4 and less than 2.2.6 are affected by a data leakage vulnerability. The `$this->validate()` method, which is expected to return only the validated dataset, was returning all properties of the Livewire component. This regression introduced a security risk, allowing unvalidated data to be exposed, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.
