  macroquad vulnerable to multiple soundness issues
  Several soundness issues have been reported. Resolving them doesn't seem to be considered a priority. In particular, unprincipled use of mutable statics is pervasive throughout the library, making it possible to cause use-after-free in safe code.

  Currently, no fixed version is available.
