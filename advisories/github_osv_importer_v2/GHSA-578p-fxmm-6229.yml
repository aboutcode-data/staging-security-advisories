summary: "Potentially untrusted input is rendered as HTML in final output\n### Impact\n\nAll\
  \ users of mjml-python who insert untrusted data into mjml templates unless that data is checked\
  \ in a very strict manner. User input like `&lt;script&gt;` would be rendered as `<script>`\
  \ in the final HTML output.\n\nThe attacker must be able to control some data which is later\
  \ injected in an mjml template which is then send out as email to other users. The attacker\
  \ could control contents of email messages sent through the platform.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe\
  \ problem has been fixed in version 0.11.0 of this library. Versions before 0.10.0 are not\
  \ affected by this security issue which was added as part of commit 84c495da20a91640a1ca551ace17df7f3be644aa.\n\
  \n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Ensure that potentially untrusted user input does not contain any\
  \ sequences which could be rendered as HTML. \n\n\n### References\n\n- Initial issue report\
  \ by @sh-at-cs in #52"
