  - CVE-2023-46740
summary: "Insecure random string generator used for sensitive data\nCubeFS used an insecure\
  \ random string generator to generate user-specific, sensitive keys used to authenticate users\
  \ in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated\
  \ string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges.\n\nWhen CubeFS creates\
  \ new users, it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”.\
  \ To create the \"accesKey\", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy\
  \ to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. \n\nAn attacker could leverage the predictable\
  \ random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain\
  \ higher privileges.\n\nThere is no evidence of this vulnerability being exploited in the\
  \ wild. It was found during a security audit carried out by [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/)\
  \ in collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).\n\
  \nThe issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than to upgrade."
