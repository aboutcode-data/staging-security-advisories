  Users with SCRIPT right can execute arbitrary code in XWiki
  ### Impact

  Any user with SCRIPT right (EDIT right before XWiki 7.4) can gain access to the application server Servlet context which contains tools allowing to instantiate arbitrary Java objects and invoke methods that may lead to arbitrary code execution.

  ### Patches

  It has been patched in both version XWiki 12.2.1 and XWiki 11.10.5.

  ### Workarounds

  The only workaround is to give SCRIPT right only to trusted users.
