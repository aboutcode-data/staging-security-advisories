aliases:
  - CVE-2020-11050
summary: |
  Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch in Java-WebSocket
  The Java-WebSocket Client does not perform hostname verification.

   - This means that SSL certificates of other hosts are accepted as long as they are trusted. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker has to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between a Java application using the Java-WebSocket Client and an WebSocket server it's connecting to.
   - TLS normally protects users and systems against MITM attacks, it cannot if certificates from other trusted hosts are accepted by the client.

  For more information see: CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html

  ## Important note

  The OWASP Dependency-Check (https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/index.html) may report that a dependency of your project is affected by this security vulnerability, but you don't use this lib.
  This is caused by the fuzzy search in the OWASP implementation.
