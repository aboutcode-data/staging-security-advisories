summary: "vLLM vulnerable to DoS via large Chat Completion or Tokenization requests with specially\
  \ crafted `chat_template_kwargs`\n### Summary\nThe /v1/chat/completions and /tokenize endpoints\
  \ allow a `chat_template_kwargs` request parameter that is used in the code before it is properly\
  \ validated against the chat template. With the right `chat_template_kwargs` parameters, it\
  \ is possible to block processing of the API server for long periods of time, delaying all\
  \ other requests \n\n### Details\nIn serving_engine.py, the chat_template_kwargs are unpacked\
  \ into kwargs passed to chat_utils.py `apply_hf_chat_template` with no validation on the keys\
  \ or values in that chat_template_kwargs dict. This means they can be used to override optional\
  \ parameters in the `apply_hf_chat_template` method, such as `tokenize`, changing its default\
  \ from False to True.\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/2a6dc67eb520ddb9c4138d8b35ed6fe6226997fb/vllm/entrypoints/openai/serving_engine.py#L809-L814\n\
  \nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/2a6dc67eb520ddb9c4138d8b35ed6fe6226997fb/vllm/entrypoints/chat_utils.py#L1602-L1610\n\
  \nBoth serving_chat.py and serving_tokenization.py call into this `_preprocess_chat` method\
  \ of `serving_engine.py` and they both pass in `chat_template_kwargs`.\n\nSo, a `chat_template_kwargs`\
  \ like `{\"tokenize\": True}` makes tokenization happen as part of applying the chat template,\
  \ even though that is not expected. Tokenization is a blocking operation, and with sufficiently\
  \ large input can block the API server's event loop, which blocks handling of all other requests\
  \ until this tokenization is complete.\n\nThis optional `tokenize` parameter to `apply_hf_chat_template`\
  \ does not appear to be used, so one option would be to just hard-code that to always be False\
  \ instead of allowing it to be optionally overridden by callers. A better option may be to\
  \ not pass `chat_template_kwargs` as unpacked kwargs but instead as a dict, and only unpack\
  \ them after the logic in `apply_hf_chat_template` that resolves the kwargs against the chat\
  \ template.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny authenticated user can cause a denial of service to a vLLM\
  \ server with Chat Completion or Tokenize requests.\n\n### Fix\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27205"
