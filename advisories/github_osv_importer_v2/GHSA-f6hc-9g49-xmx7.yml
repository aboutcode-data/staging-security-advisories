summary: "nistec has Incorrect Calculation in Multiplication of unreduced P-256 scalars\nMultiplication\
  \ of certain unreduced P-256 scalars produce incorrect results. There are no protocols known\
  \ at this time that can be attacked due to this.\n\nFrom the fix commit notes:\n\n> Unlike\
  \ the rest of nistec, the P-256 assembly doesn't use complete addition formulas, meaning that\
  \ p256PointAdd[Affine]Asm won't return the correct value if the two inputs are equal.\n> \n\
  > This was (undocumentedly) ignored in the scalar multiplication loops because as long as\
  \ the input point is not the identity and the scalar is lower than the order of the group,\
  \ the addition inputs can't be the same.\n> \n> As part of the math/big rewrite, we went however\
  \ from always reducing the scalar to only checking its length, under the incorrect assumption\
  \ that the scalar multiplication loop didn't require reduction."
