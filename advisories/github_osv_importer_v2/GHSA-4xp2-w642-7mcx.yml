summary: |
  Cilium vulnerable to bypass of namespace restrictions in CiliumNetworkPolicy
  ### Impact

  An attacker with the ability to create or modify CiliumNetworkPolicy objects in a particular namespace is able to affect traffic on an entire Cilium cluster, potentially bypassing policy enforcement in other namespaces.

  By using a crafted `endpointSelector` that uses the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label, the attacker can create policies that bypass namespace restrictions and affect the entire Cilium cluster. This includes potentially allowing or denying all traffic.

  This attack requires API server access, as described in the [Kubernetes API Server Attacker](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/threat-model/#kubernetes-api-server-attacker) section of the Cilium Threat Model.

  ### Patches

  This issue was patched in https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/28007

  This issue affects:

  - Cilium <= v1.14.1
  - Cilium <= v1.13.6
  - Cilium <= v1.12.13

  This issue has been resolved in:

  - Cilium v1.14.2
  - Cilium v1.13.7
  - Cilium v1.12.14

  ### Workarounds

  An admission webhook can be used to prevent the use of `endpointSelector`s that use the `DoesNotExist` operator on the `reserved:init` label in CiliumNetworkPolicies.

  ### Acknowledgements
  The Cilium community has worked together with members of Palantir and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @odinuge for reporting this issue and @joestringer for the fix.
