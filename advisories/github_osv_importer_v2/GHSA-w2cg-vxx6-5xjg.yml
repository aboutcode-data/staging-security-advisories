  OpenClaw: denial of service through large base64 media files allocating large buffers before limit checks
  ## Summary

  Base64-backed media inputs could be decoded into Buffers before enforcing decoded-size budgets. An attacker supplying oversized base64 payloads can force large allocations, causing memory pressure and denial of service.

  ## Attack Scenario Notes

  - Recommended deployments bind the gateway to loopback by default and require gateway auth for HTTP endpoints. In that configuration, this is best modeled as a local/authorized DoS.
  - If an operator exposes the gateway to untrusted networks (or disables/weakens auth and rate limits), treat this as a higher-severity network DoS risk.

  ## Affected Packages / Versions

  - openclaw (npm): <= 2026.2.13
  - clawdbot (npm): <= 2026.1.24-3

  ## Fixed In

  - openclaw (npm): 2026.2.14 (planned)
  - clawdbot (npm): no patched release planned; migrate to openclaw

  ## Fix Commit(s)
