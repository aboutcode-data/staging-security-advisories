summary: "Craft Commerce has Stored XSS in Inventory Location Address Leading to Potential Privilege\
  \ Escalation\n## Summary\nA stored XSS vulnerability in Craft Commerce allows attackers to\
  \ execute malicious JavaScript in an administrator’s browser. This occurs because the 'Address\
  \ Line 1' field in Inventory Locations is not properly sanitized before being displayed in\
  \ the admin panel.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### Required Permissions\n- General permissions:\n\
  \t- Access the control panel\n\t- Access Craft Commerce\n- Craft Commerce permissions:\n\t\
  - Manage inventory locations\n- An active administrator elevated session\n\n<img width=\"\

  \ />\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Log in to the Admin Panel with the attacker account with\
  \ the permissions mentioned above.\n2. Navigate to **Commerce** -> **Inventory Locations**\
  \ -> **Default** (`/admin/commerce/inventory-locations/1`).\n3. In the **Address Line 1**\
  \ field, enter the following payload:\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"alert(document.domain)\"\
  >\n```\n4. Click **Save** and you'll be redirected back to the **Inventory Locations** page.\n\
  5. Notice the alert proving JavaScript execution.\n<img width=\"1814\" height=\"606\" alt=\"\
  alert-poc\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f08aed21-a676-4dee-85a8-d195bab85685\"\
  \ />\n\n\n\n### Privilege Escalation to Administrator:\n1. Do the same steps above, but replace\
  \ the payload with a malicious one.\n2. The following payload elevates the attacker’s account\
  \ to Admin if there’s already an elevated session, replace the `<UserID>` with the attacker\
  \ id:\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"fetch('/admin/users/<UserID>/permissions',{method:'POST',body:`CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN=${Craft.csrfTokenValue}&userId=<UserID>&admin=1&action=users/save-permissions`,headers:{'content-type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}})\"\
  >\n```\n3. In another browser, log in as an admin & go to the vulnerable page (Inventory Location\
  \ page).\n4. Go back to the attacker account & notice it now has admin status.\n\nThe privilege\
  \ escalation requires an elevated session. In a real-world scenario, an attacker can automate\
  \ the process by forcing a logout if the victim’s session is stale; upon re-authentication,\
  \ the stored XSS payload executes within a fresh elevated session to complete the attack.\n\
  \nOr even easier (and smarter), an attacker (using the XSS) can create a fake 'Session Expired'\
  \ login modal overlay. Since it’s on the trusted domain, administrators will likely enter\
  \ their credentials, sending them directly to the attacker.\n\n### Resources:\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/commerce/commit/fa273330807807d05b564d37c88654cd772839ee"
