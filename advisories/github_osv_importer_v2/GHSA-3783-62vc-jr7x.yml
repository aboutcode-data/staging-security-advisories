summary: "ConsoleMe has an Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability via Limited Git command\n## ID:\
  \ NFLX-2024-002\n\n### Impact\nAuthenticated users can achieve limited RCE in ConsoleMe, restricted\
  \ to flag inputs on a single CLI command. Due to this constraint, it is not currently known\
  \ whether full RCE is possible but it is unlikely. \nHowever, a specific flag allows authenticated\
  \ users to read any server files accessible by the ConsoleMe process. Given ConsoleMe's role\
  \ as an AWS identity broker, accessing files containing secrets on the server could potentially\
  \ be exploited for privilege escalation.\n\nDeployments of ConsoleMe that allow templated\
  \ resources are impacted and urged to patch immediately. Deployments that do not permit templated\
  \ resources are not affected.\n\nTo determine if your ConsoleMe deployment uses templated\
  \ resources, check the configuration value for `cache_resource_templates.repositories`. If\
  \ this value does not exist or is an empty array, your deployment is not impacted.\n### Description\n\
  The self-service flow for templated resources in ConsoleMe accepts a user-supplied JSON post\
  \ body, which includes the filename for the templated resource. However, this user-supplied\
  \ filename is not properly sanitized and is passed directly as a string to a CLI command.\
  \ This allows users to input flags instead of filenames. By passing a specific flag with a\
  \ filename value, users can induce an error that reveals the contents of the specified file,\
  \ allowing them to read any files readable by the system user executing the ConsoleMe server\
  \ process.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in version [v1.4.0](https://pypi.org/project/consoleme/1.4.0/)\
  \ via https://github.com/Netflix/consoleme/pull/9380. \nIf you are unable to upgrade to the\
  \ latest version, users can selectively apply the code changes in the above PR. Alternatively,\
  \ removing the configuration item `cache_resource_templates.repositories` or adding it as\
  \ an empty array should mitigate the issue, but will result in broken functionality (templated\
  \ resources will no longer be supported for self-service).\n\n### Credit\n[Jay Dhulia](https://github.com/jaydhulia)"
