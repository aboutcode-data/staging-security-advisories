summary: "JADX file override vulnerability\n### Summary\nwhen jadx parses a resource file, there\
  \ is an escape problem with the style file, which can overwrite other files in the directory\
  \ when saving the decompile result.\n\nAlthough I don't think this vulnerability realizes\
  \ path traversal in the true sense of the word , I reported it anyway\n\n### Details\n\nI\
  \ see that getResAlias does something with the filename.\n\n```java\nprivate String getResAlias(int\
  \ resRef, String origKeyName, @Nullable FieldNode constField) {\n```\n\nbut type style will\
  \ return the original filename directly.\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232212491.jpeg)\n\
  so our goal is to take a malicious file that was originally of type raw, modify its type to\
  \ style, trick jadx into\n\n#### step1\n\ncreate an android project using androidstudio and\
  \ create a raw folder with the name attack_file_sayhiiiiiiiiiiiii, it doesn't matter what\
  \ the content is!\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232212073.jpg)\n\
  generate an initial APK\n\n#### step2 \n\nextract this initial APK using ZIP software to get\
  \ resources.arsc\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232212841.jpg)\n\
  drop resources.arsc into 010editor\n\n#### step3\n\nsearch for the previous filename attack_file_sayhiiiiiiiiiiiii\
  \ , two will appear here, we choose the second one\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213527.jpg)\n\
  let's change the name of the file here. I'll change it to ../../_file_sayhiiiiiiiiiiiii\n\n\
  note that you can only overwrite files in the folder where the decompile was saved.\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213343.jpg)\n\
  #### step4 \nchange the type of this file to style\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213183.jpg)\n\
  modified to 0E\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213484.jpg)\n\
  #### step5 \n\nAfter saving, re-compress the whole folder into a zip, then change the extension\
  \ to APK.\n\nopen it with JADX and you can see that it has been changed to a style type.\n\
  \n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213864.jpg)\nclick save all\n\
  \n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213119.jpg)\nyou can see\
  \ the file escaping.\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213746.jpg)\n\
  so we can also construct a  \n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213497.jpg)\n\
  so the classes.dex file is also replaced here\n\n![img](https://quan9i.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/202401232213075.jpg)\n\
