summary: "matrix-media-repo (MMR) allows denial of service/high operating costs through unauthenticated\
  \ downloads\n### Impact\n\nMMR before version 1.3.5 is vulnerable to unbounded disk consumption,\
  \ where an unauthenticated adversary can induce it to download and cache large amounts of\
  \ remote media files.\n\nMMR's typical operating environment uses S3-like storage as a backend,\
  \ with file-backed store as an alternative option. Instances using a file-backed store or\
  \ those which self-host an S3 storage system are therefore vulnerable to a disk fill attack.\
  \ Once the disk is full, authenticated users will be unable to upload new media, resulting\
  \ in denial of service.\n\nFor instances configured to use a cloud-based S3 storage option,\
  \ this could result in high service fees instead of a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\n\n\
  MMR 1.3.5 introduces a new default-on \"leaky bucket\" rate limit to reduce the amount of\
  \ data a user can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but does limit\
  \ an unauthenticated user's ability to request large amounts of data.\n\nOperators should\
  \ note that the leaky bucket implementation introduced in MMR 1.3.5 requires the IP address\
  \ associated with the request to be forwarded, to avoid mistakenly applying the rate limit\
  \ to the reverse proxy instead. To avoid this issue, the reverse proxy should populate the\
  \ `X-Forwarded-For` header when sending the request to MMR.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOperators\
  \ may wish to lower the maximum file size they allow and implement harsh rate limits, though\
  \ this can still lead to a large amount of data to be downloaded. \n\n### References\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#As_a_meter"
