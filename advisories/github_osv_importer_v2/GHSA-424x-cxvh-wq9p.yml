summary: |
  Mautic allows user name enumeration due to response time difference on password reset form
  ### Summary

  This advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic related to the "Forget your password" functionality. This vulnerability could be exploited by unauthenticated users to enumerate valid usernames.

  User Enumeration via Timing Attack: A user enumeration vulnerability exists in the "Forget your password" functionality. Differences in response times for existing and non-existing users, combined with a lack of request limiting, allow an attacker to determine the existence of usernames through a timing-based attack.

  ### Mitigation
  Please update to a version that addresses this timing vulnerability, where password reset responses are normalized to respond at the same time regardless of user existence.

  ### Workarounds
  None
