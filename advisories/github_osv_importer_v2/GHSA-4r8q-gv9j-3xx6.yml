  - CVE-2021-32645
summary: |
  Open Redirect
  ### Impact
  In some situations, it is possible to have open redirects where users can be redirected from your site to any other site using a specially crafted URL.
  This is only the case for installations where the default Hostname Identification is used and the environment uses tenants that have `force_https` set to `true` (default: `false`)

  ### Patches
  Version 5.7.2 contains the relevant patches to fix this bug. Stripping the URL from special characters to prevent specially crafted URL's from being redirected to.

  ### Workarounds
  There is a simple way to work around the security issue
  - Set the `force_https` to every tenant to `false`
