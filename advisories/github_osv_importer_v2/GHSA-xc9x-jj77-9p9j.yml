  Nokogiri update packaged libxml2 to v2.12.5 to resolve CVE-2024-25062
  ## Summary

  Nokogiri upgrades its dependency libxml2 as follows:
  - Nokogiri v1.15.6 upgrades libxml2 to [2.11.7](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.11.7) from 2.11.6
  - Nokogiri v1.16.2 upgrades libxml2 to [2.12.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.5) from 2.12.4

  libxml2 v2.11.7 and v2.12.5 address the following vulnerability:

  - CVE-2024-25062 / https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25062
    - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/604
    - patched by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/92721970

  Please note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.

  JRuby users are not affected.

  ## Mitigation

  Upgrade to Nokogiri `~> 1.15.6` or `>= 1.16.2`.

  Users who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile
  and link Nokogiri against patched external libxml2 libraries which will also address these same
  issues.

  ## Impact

  From the CVE description, this issue applies to the `xmlTextReader` module (which underlies `Nokogiri::XML::Reader`):

  > When using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation and XInclude expansion enabled, processing crafted XML documents can lead to an xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free.
