  - CVE-2023-42817
summary: |
  pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in Translations
  ### Impact
  The translation value with text including “%s” (from “%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it’s supposed to be output literally to the user.

  The translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain “modules”) and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box.
