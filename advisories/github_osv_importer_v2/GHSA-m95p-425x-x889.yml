summary: |
  cggmp21 has a missing check in the ZK proof used in CGGMP21
  ### Impact
  cggmp21  concerns a missing check in the ZK proof that enables an attack in which a single malicious signer can reconstruct full private key.

  ### Patches
  * `cggmp21 v0.6.3` is a patch release that contains a fix that introduces this specific missing check
  * However, cggmp21 recommends upgrading to `cggmp24 v0.7.0-alpha.2` which contains many other security checks as a precaution. Follow [migration guideline](https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/cggmp21/blob/v0.7.0-alpha.2/CGGMP21_MIGRATION.md) to upgrade.

  ### Workarounds
  Update to `cggmp21 v0.6.3`, a minor release that contains a minimal security patch.

  However, for full mitigation, users will need to upgrade to `cggmp24 v0.7.0-alpha.2` as it contains many more security check implementations.
