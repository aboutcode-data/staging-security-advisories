  - CVE-2016-10544
summary: |
  Denial of Service in uws
  Affected versions of `uws` do not properly handle large websocket messages when `permessage-deflate` is enabled, which may result in a denial of service condition.

  If `uws` recieves a 256Mb websocket message when `permessage-deflate` is enabled, the server will compress the message prior to executing the length check, and subsequently extract the message prior to processing. This can result in a situation where an excessively large websocket message passes the length checks, yet still gets cast from a Buffer to a string, which will exceed v8's maximum string size and crash the process.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 0.10.9 or later.

  Alternatively, disable `permessage-deflate`.
