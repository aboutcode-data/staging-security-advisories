summary: "Blind SQL injection in shopware\n### Impact\nThe Shopware application API contains\
  \ a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their\
  \ Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters\
  \ in the “aggregations”\nobject. The ‘name’ field in this “aggregations” object is vulnerable\
  \ SQL-injection and can be exploited using time-based SQL-queries. \n\n### Patches\nUpdate\
  \ to Shopware 6.5.7.4\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding\
  \ security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend\
  \ updating to the latest Shopware version."
