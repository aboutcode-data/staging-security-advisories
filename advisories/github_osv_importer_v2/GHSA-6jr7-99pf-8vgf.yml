  - CVE-2026-25153
summary: |
  @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node vulnerable to arbitrary code execution via MkDocs hooks
  ### Impact

  When TechDocs is configured with `runIn: local`, a malicious actor who can submit or modify a repository's `mkdocs.yml` file can execute arbitrary Python code on the TechDocs build server via MkDocs hooks configuration.

  ### Patches

  Upgrade to `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` version 1.13.11, 1.14.1 or later.
  The fix introduces an allowlist of supported MkDocs configuration keys. Unsupported configuration keys (including `hooks`) are now removed from `mkdocs.yml` before running the generator, with a warning logged to indicate which keys were removed.

  **Note**: Users of `@techdocs/cli` should also upgrade to the latest version, which includes the fixed `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` dependency.

  ### Workarounds

  If you cannot upgrade immediately:

  1. Use Docker mode with restricted access: Configure TechDocs with `runIn: docker` instead of `runIn: local`. This provides container isolation, though it does not fully mitigate the risk.
  2. Restrict repository access: Limit who can modify `mkdocs.yml` files in repositories that TechDocs processes. Only allow trusted contributors.
  3. Manual review: Implement PR review requirements for changes to `mkdocs.yml` files to detect malicious `hooks` configurations before they are merged.
  4. Downgrade MkDocs: Use MkDocs < 1.4.0 (e.g., 1.3.1) which does not support hooks. Note: This may limit access to newer MkDocs features.

  **Note**: Building documentation in CI/CD pipelines using `@techdocs/cli` does not mitigate this vulnerability, as the CLI uses the same vulnerable `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` package.
