  pnpm v10+ Bypass "Dependency lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default"
  # pnpm v10+ Git Dependency Script Execution Bypass

  ### Summary

  A security bypass vulnerability in pnpm v10+ allows git-hosted dependencies to execute arbitrary code during `pnpm install`, circumventing the v10 security feature "Dependency lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default". While pnpm v10 blocks `postinstall` scripts via the `onlyBuiltDependencies` mechanism, git dependencies can still execute `prepare`, `prepublish`, and `prepack` scripts during the fetch phase, enabling remote code execution without user consent or approval.

  ### Details

  pnpm v10 introduced a security feature to disable dependency lifecycle scripts by default ([PR #8897](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8897)). This is implemented by setting `onlyBuiltDependencies = []` when no build policy is configured:

  **File:** `pkg-manager/core/src/install/extendInstallOptions.ts` (lines 290-291)
  ```typescript
  if (opts.neverBuiltDependencies == null && opts.onlyBuiltDependencies == null && opts.onlyBuiltDependenciesFile == null) {
    opts.onlyBuiltDependencies = []
  }
  ```

  This creates an allowlist that blocks all packages from running scripts during the **BUILD phase** in `exec/build-modules/src/index.ts`.

  However, git-hosted dependencies are processed differently. During the **FETCH phase**, git packages are prepared using `preparePackage()`:

  **File:** `exec/prepare-package/src/index.ts` (lines 28-57)
  ```typescript
  export async function preparePackage (opts: PreparePackageOptions, gitRootDir: string, subDir: string) {
    // ...
    if (opts.ignoreScripts) return { shouldBeBuilt: true, pkgDir }  // Only checks ignoreScripts, not onlyBuiltDependencies

    const execOpts: RunLifecycleHookOptions = {
      // ...
      rawConfig: omit(['ignore-scripts'], opts.rawConfig),  // Explicitly removes ignore-scripts!
    }

    // Runs npm/pnpm install
    await runLifecycleHook(installScriptName, manifest, execOpts)

    // Runs prepare scripts
    for (const scriptName of PREPUBLISH_SCRIPTS) {  // ['prepublish', 'prepack', 'publish']
      await runLifecycleHook(newScriptName, manifest, execOpts)
    }
  }
  ```

  The `ignoreScripts` option defaults to `false` and is completely separate from `onlyBuiltDependencies`. The `onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist is never consulted during the fetch phase.

  **Affected scripts that execute during fetch:**
  - `prepare`
  - `prepublish`
  - `prepack`

  **Attack vectors:**
  - `git+https://github.com/attacker/malicious.git`
  - `github:attacker/malicious`
  - `gitlab:attacker/malicious`
  - `bitbucket:attacker/malicious`
  - `git+ssh://git@github.com/attacker/malicious.git`
  - `git+file:///path/to/local/repo`

  ### PoC

  **Prerequisites:**
  - pnpm v10.0.0 or later (tested on v10.23.0 and v11.0.0-alpha.1)
  - git

  **Steps to reproduce:**

  1. Extract the attached [poc.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23797816/poc.zip)

  2. Run the PoC script:
     ```bash
     cd poc
     chmod +x run-poc.sh
     ./run-poc.sh
     ```

  3. Verify the marker file was created by the malicious script:
     ```bash
     cat /tmp/pnpm-vuln-poc-marker.txt
     ```

  **Manual reproduction:**

  1. Create a malicious package with a `prepare` script:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "malicious-pkg",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "scripts": {
         "prepare": "node -e \"require('fs').writeFileSync('/tmp/pwned.txt', 'RCE!')\""
       }
     }
     ```

  2. Initialize it as a git repo and commit the files

  3. Create a victim project that depends on it (just have to make sure it actually git clones and not just downloads a tarball):
     ```json
     {
       "dependencies": {
         "malicious-pkg": "git+file:///path/to/malicious-pkg"
       }
     }
     ```

  4. Run `pnpm install` - the prepare script executes without any warning or approval prompt

  ### Impact

  **Severity: High**

  **Who is impacted:**
  - All pnpm v10+ users
  - Users who believed they were protected by the v10 "scripts disabled by default" feature
  - CI/CD pipelines

  **Attack scenarios:**
  1. **Supply chain attack:** An attacker compromises a dependency, adding to it a malicious git dependency that executes arbitrary code during `pnpm install`

  **What an attacker can do:**
  - Execute arbitrary code with the victim's privileges
  - Exfiltrate environment variables, secrets, and credentials
  - Modify source code or inject backdoors
  - Establish persistence or reverse shells
  - Access the filesystem and network

  **Why this bypasses security expectations:**
  - pnpm v10 changelog explicitly states "Lifecycle scripts of dependencies are not executed during installation by default"
  - Users expect git dependencies to follow the same security model as npm registry packages
  - There is no warning that git dependencies are treated differently
  - The `onlyBuiltDependencies` configuration does not affect git dependencies
