  Holder can generate proof of ownership for credentials it does not control in vp-toolkit
  ### Impact
  The [`verifyVerifiablePresentation()`](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit/blob/master/src/service/signers/verifiable-presentation-signer.ts#L97) method check the cryptographic integrity of the Verifiable Presentation, but it does not check if the [`credentialSubject.id`](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit-models/blob/develop/src/model/verifiable-credential.ts#L150) DID matches the signer of the VP proof.

  The **verifier** is impacted by this vulnerability.

  ### Patches
  Patch will be available in version 0.2.2.

  ### Workarounds
  - Compute the address out of the `verifiablePresentation.proof.n.verificationMethod` using `getAddressFromPubKey()` from `crypt-util@0.1.5` and match it with the `credentialSubject.id` address from the credential.
