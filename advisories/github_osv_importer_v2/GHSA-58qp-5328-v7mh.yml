summary: "cumulative-distribution-function Infinite Loop vulnerability\n### Impact\n\n* Apps\
  \ using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop\n* In the case\
  \ of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs\
  \ server may crash.  This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server\
  \ to be rebooted for proper operation.  \n* In the case of a browser app using this library\
  \ to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up.\n\nA flaw enabling\
  \ an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function\n\
  of input data.   Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users\
  \ may confuse an array\nof strings like [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5]\
  \ when it is in fact string data.  An infinite loop is possible when the \ncumulative-distribution-function\
  \  is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`.\
  \  \n\nThis vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app\
  \ using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply\
  \ malformed data to the library.  The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to\n\
  be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid,\
  \ but undetected by earlier version of the library).\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade\
  \ to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version.\n\nTests for several types of invalid data have\
  \ been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by\nthrowing\
  \ a `TypeError()` instead of processing it.  Developers using this library may wish to adjust\
  \ their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError.  Apps performing\
  \ proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected\
  \ by this patch.  \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions\
  \ by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed\
  \ to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.  \n\n### For\
  \ more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an\
  \ issue in the Github repository at https://github.com/DrPaulBrewer/cumulative-distribution-function"
