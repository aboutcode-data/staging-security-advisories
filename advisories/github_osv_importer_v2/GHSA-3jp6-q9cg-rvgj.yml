summary: |
  Missing permission check in Jenkins build-publisher Plugin
  Jenkins Build-Publisher Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint, allowing attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain names and URLs of Jenkins servers that the plugin is configured to publish builds to, as well as builds pending for publication to those Jenkins servers. At this time there is no known workaround or fix. The Build-Publisher plugin distribution has been suspended.
