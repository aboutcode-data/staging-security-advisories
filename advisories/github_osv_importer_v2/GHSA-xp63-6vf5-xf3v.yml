  - CVE-2020-15123
summary: "Command injection in codecov (npm package)\n### Impact\n\nThe `upload` method has\
  \ a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the `codecov-node` library are unlikely to\
  \ be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.\n\n\
  A similar CVE was issued: [CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh),\
  \ but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked `&`, and command injection is still possible\
  \ using backticks instead to bypass the sanitizer.\n\nWe have written a [CodeQL](https://codeql.com)\
  \ query, which automatically detects this vulnerability. You can see the results of the query\
  \ on the `codecov-node` project [here](https://lgtm.com/query/7714424068617023832/).\n\n\n\
  ### Patches\nThis has been patched in version 3.7.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone, however, the\
  \ attack surface is low in this case. Particularly in the standard use of codecov, where the\
  \ module is used directly in a build pipeline, not built against as a library in another application\
  \ that may supply malicious input and perform command injection. \n\n### References\n*  [CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh)\n\
