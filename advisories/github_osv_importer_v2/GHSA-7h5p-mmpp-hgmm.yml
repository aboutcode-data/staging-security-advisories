summary: "Nuclei Template Signature Verification Bypass\n## Summary\nA vulnerability has been\
  \ identified in Nuclei's template signature verification system that could allow an attacker\
  \ to bypass the signature check and possibly execute malicious code via custom code template.\n\
  \n## Affected Component\nThe vulnerability is present in the template signature verification\
  \ process, specifically in the `signer` package.\n\n## Description\nThe vulnerability stems\
  \ from a discrepancy between how the signature verification process and the YAML parser handle\
  \ newline characters, combined with the way multiple signatures are processed. This allows\
  \ an attacker to inject malicious content into a template while maintaining a valid signature\
  \ for the benign part of the template.\n\n### Affected Users\n1. **CLI Users:** Those executing\
  \ **custom code templates** from unverified sources. This includes templates authored by third\
  \ parties or obtained from unverified repositories.\n2. **SDK Users:** Developers integrating\
  \ Nuclei into their platforms, particularly if they permit the execution of **custom code\
  \ templates** by end-users.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Code templates are disabled as default, users\
  \ have to explicitly enable with `-code` option. \n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n```yaml\nid: example-template\n\
  info:\n  name: Example Template\n# Other benign content...\n# digest: <valid_signature_for_benign_content>\n\
  # digest: <another_signature>\\r\ncode:\\r\n  - engine:\\r\n      - sh\\r\n      - bash\\\
  r\n    source: |\\r\n      id\\r\n```\n### Patches\n1. The vulnerability is addressed in Nuclei\
  \ v3.3.2 Users are strongly recommended to update to this version to mitigate the security\
  \ risk.\n2. Fix reference - https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/commit/0da993afe6d41b4b1b814e8fad23a2acba13c60a\n\
  \n### Mitigation\n- **Immediate Upgrade**: The primary recommendation is to upgrade to Nuclei\
  \ v3.2.0, where the vulnerability has been patched.\n- **Avoid Unverified Templates**: As\
  \ an interim measure, users should refrain from using custom templates if unable to upgrade\
  \ immediately. Only trusted, [verified templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates)\
  \ should be executed.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are unable to upgrade nuclei, disable running\
  \ custom code templates as workaround.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank [Guy\
  \ Goldenberg](https://github.com/GuyGoldenberg) from Wiz who reported this to us via our security\
  \ email, [security@projectdiscovery.io](mailto:security@projectdiscovery.io)."
