  - CVE-2025-25286
summary: |
  Crayfish allows Remote Code Execution via Homarus Authorization header
  ### Impact

  Remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations.

  ### Patches

  The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`

  ### Workarounds

  The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus.

  Configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.
