summary: "Gogs allows deletion of internal files which leads to remote command execution\n###\
  \ Summary\nDue to the insufficient patch for the CVE-2024-39931, it's still possible to delete\
  \ files under the `.git` directory and achieve remote command execution.\n\n### Details\n\
  In the patch for CVE-2024-39931, the following check is added:\nhttps://github.com/gogs/gogs/commit/77a4a945ae9a87f77e392e9066b560edb71b5de9\n\
  \n```diff\n+\t// \U0001F6A8 SECURITY: Prevent uploading files into the \".git\" directory\n\
  +\tif isRepositoryGitPath(opts.TreePath) {\n+\t\treturn errors.Errorf(\"bad tree path %q\"\
  , opts.TreePath)\n+\t}\n```\n\n\nWhile the above code snippet checks if the specified path\
  \ is a `.git` directory, there are no checks for symbolic links in the later steps. So, by\
  \ creating a symbolic link that points to the `.git` directory, an attacker can still delete\
  \ arbitrary files in the `.git` directory and achieve remote command execution.\n\n### Impact\n\
  Unprivileged user accounts can execute arbitrary commands on the Gogs instance with the privileges\
  \ of the account specified by `RUN_USER` in the configuration. It allows attackers to access\
  \ and alter any users' code hosted on the same instance."
