  - CVE-2020-2119
summary: |
  Client secret transmitted in plain text by Azure AD Plugin
  Azure AD Plugin stores a client secret in its global configuration.

  While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Azure AD Plugin 1.1.2 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

  Azure AD Plugin 1.2.0 transmits the client secret in its global configuration encrypted.
