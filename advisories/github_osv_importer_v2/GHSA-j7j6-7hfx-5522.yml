  Duplicate Advisory: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests in Waitress
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-4ppp-gpcr-7qf6. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.
