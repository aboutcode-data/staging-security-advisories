  Command Injection in giting
  All versions of `gitting` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `pull` function is vulnerable through the `branch` variable.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
