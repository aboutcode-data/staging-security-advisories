  - CVE-2025-64149
summary: |
  Jenkins Publish to Bitbucket Plugin vulnerable to CSRF and missing permissions check
  Jenkins Publish to Bitbucket Plugin 0.4 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
