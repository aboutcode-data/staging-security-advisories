summary: "ActiveAdmin CSV Injection leading to sensitive information disclosure\n### Impact\n\
  \nIn ActiveAdmin versions prior to 3.2.0, maliciously crafted spreadsheet formulas could be\
  \ uploaded as part of admin data that, when exported to a CSV file and the imported to a spreadsheet\
  \ program like libreoffice, could lead to remote code execution and private data exfiltration.\n\
  \nThe attacker would need privileges to upload data to the same ActiveAdmin application as\
  \ the victim, and would need the victim to possibly ignore security warnings from their spreadsheet\
  \ program.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersions 3.2.0 and above fixed the problem by escaping any data\
  \ starting with `=` and other characters used by spreadsheet programs.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nOnly turn on formula evaluation in spreadsheet programs when importing CSV after explicitly\
  \ reviewing the file.  \n\n### References\n\nhttps://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection\n\
