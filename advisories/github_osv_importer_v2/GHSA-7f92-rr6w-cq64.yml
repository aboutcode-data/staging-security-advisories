  Storage corruption due to variables overwritten by re-entrancy locks
  ### Background
  When attempting to use the v0.2.14 release, @pandadefi discovered an issue using the `@nonreentrant` decorator.

  ### Impact
  Reentrancy protection storage slots get allocated to the same slots as storage variables, leading to the corruption of storage variables when using the `@nonreentrant` decorator.

  ### Patches
  This issue was fixed in v0.2.15 in #2391, #2379

  ### Workarounds
  Don't use the `@nonreentrant` decorator in these versions.
