  Withdrawn Advisory: Out-of-bounds Read can lead to client side denial of service
  ## Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a bug, not a vulnerability. According to the maintainer, the bug only affects the client side of the request and cannot cause a denial of service on the server.

  ## Original Description
  An out-of-bounds read in the rewrite function at /modules/caddyhttp/rewrite/rewrite.go in Caddy v2.5.1 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the client side via a crafted URI.
