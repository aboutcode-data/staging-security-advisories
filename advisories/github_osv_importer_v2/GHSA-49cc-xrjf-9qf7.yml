summary: "SFTPGo allows administrators to restrict command execution from the EventManager\n\
  ### Impact\n\nOne powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute\
  \ scripts or run applications in response to certain events.\nThis feature is very common\
  \ in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. \n\nHowever, any SFTPGo\
  \ administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container\
  \ with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo, so they can access the database and\
  \ server configurations.\n\nThis is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that\
  \ there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo\
  \ WebAdmin UI.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo avoid this confusion, running system commands is now disabled\
  \ by default, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo\
  \ must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.\n\
  \nhttps://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/88b1850b5806eee81150873d4e565144b21021fb\nhttps://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b524da11e9466d05fe03304713ee1c61bb276ec4\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nAllow EventManager to be used only by SFTPGo administrators who also\
  \ have shell access."
