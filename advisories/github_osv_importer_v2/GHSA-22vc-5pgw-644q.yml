summary: |
  KubeView vulnerable to full cluster takeover due to improper authentication
  KubeView through 0.1.31 allows attackers to obtain control of a Kubernetes cluster because api/scrape/kube-system does not require authentication, and retrieves certificate files that can be used for authentication as kube-admin. NOTE: the vendor's position is that KubeView was a "fun side project and a learning exercise," and not "very secure."
