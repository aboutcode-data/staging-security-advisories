summary: |
  Neo4j Enterprise and Community editions have insufficient escaping of unicode characters in query log
  Insufficient escaping of unicode characters in query log in Neo4j Enterprise and Community editions prior to 2026.01 can lead to XSS if the user opens the logs in a tool that treats them as HTML. There is no security impact on Neo4j products, but this advisory is released as a precaution to treat the logs as plain text if using versions prior to 2026.01.
