  Malicious Package in bmap
  Version 1.0.3 of `bmap` contained malicious code. The code when executed in the browser would enumerate password, cvc, cardnumber fields from forms and send the extracted values to `https://js-metrics.com/minjs.php?pl=`


  ## Recommendation

  If version 1.0.3 of this module is found installed you will want to replace it with a version before or after 1.0.3. In addition to replacing the installed module, you will also want to evaluate your application to determine whether or not user data was compromised.
