  - CVE-2023-33187
summary: "html inputs of type password recorded in plaintext when converted to text inputs\n\
  ### Impact\nHighlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input\
  \ is switched to `type=\"text\"` via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from\
  \ the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=\"password\"` inputs. A customer may\
  \ assume that switching to `type=\"text\"` would also not record this input; hence, they would\
  \ not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting\
  \ in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used.\n\n\
  ### Patches\n`highlight.run@6.0.0` resolves the issue via https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1184\n\
  This patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used\
  \ to be a `type=\"password\"` continues to be obfuscated. \n\n### Workarounds\nWe have deployed\
  \ a change to our data ingest to obfuscate passwords server side from older clients.\nThis\
  \ means that upgrading to the latest version of highlight.run is not necessary but recommended\
  \ to prevent potential network transfer of recorded password data to our backend.\n\n### References\n\
