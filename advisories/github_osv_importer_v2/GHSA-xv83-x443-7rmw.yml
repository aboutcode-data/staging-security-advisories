aliases:
  - CVE-2023-30609
summary: |
  HTML injection in search results via plaintext message highlighting
  ### Impact
  Plain text messages containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a specific message containing an HTML injection payload.

  Cross-site scripting is possible by including resources from `recaptcha.net` and `gstatic.com` which are included in the default CSP.

  Thanks to [Cadence Ember](https://cadence.moe/) for finding the injection and to [S1m](https://github.com/p1gp1g/) for finding possible XSS vectors.

  ### Patches
  Version 3.71.0 of the SDK fixes the issue.

  ### Workarounds
  Restarting the client will clear the injection.
