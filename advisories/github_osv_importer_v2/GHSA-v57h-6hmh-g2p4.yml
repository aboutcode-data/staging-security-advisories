  - CVE-2022-39242
summary: "Weight not properly refunded after EVM execution\n### Impact\n\nPreviously, the worst\
  \ case weight was always accounted as the block weight for all cases. In case of large EVM\
  \ gas refunds, this can lead to block spamming attacks -- the adversary can construct blocks\
  \ with transactions that have large amount of refunds or unused gases with reverts, and as\
  \ a result inflate up the chain gas prices. This issue is fixed by properly refund unused\
  \ weights after each EVM execution.\n\nThe impact of this issue is limited in that the spamming\
  \ attack would still be costly for any adversary, and it has no ability to alter any chain\
  \ state. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/pull/851\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nNone.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find\
  \ out more?_\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this\
  \ advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Frontier repo](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/issues)\n\
