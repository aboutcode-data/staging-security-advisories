summary: |
  Command Injection Vulnerability in Mechanize
  This security advisory has been created for public disclosure of a Command Injection vulnerability that was responsibly reported by @kyoshidajp (Katsuhiko YOSHIDA).

  ### Impact

  Mechanize `>= v2.0`, `< v2.7.7` allows for OS commands to be injected using several classes' methods which implicitly use Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Exploitation is possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of these calls:

  - `Mechanize::CookieJar#load`: since v2.0 (see 208e3ed)
  - `Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as`: since v2.0 (see 5b776a4)
  - `Mechanize#download`: since v2.2 (see dc91667)
  - `Mechanize::Download#save` and `#save!` since v2.1 (see 98b2f51, bd62ff0)
  - `Mechanize::File#save` and `#save_as`: since v2.1 (see 2bf7519)
  - `Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body`: since v2.0 (see 01039f5)


  ### Patches

  These vulnerabilities are patched in Mechanize v2.7.7.


  ### Workarounds

  No workarounds are available. We recommend upgrading to v2.7.7 or later.


  ### References

  See https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_security.html#securityopen for background on why `Kernel.open` should not be used with untrusted input.
