summary: |
  `polymarket-client-sdks` was removed from crates.io for malicious code
  It appeared to be typosquatting existing crate [`polymarket-client-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/polymarket-client-sdk) (`sdks` vs `sdk`) and attempting to steal credentials from local files.

  The malicious crate had 1 version published on 2026-02-09 and had been downloaded only 33 times. There were no crates depending on this crate on crates.io.

  Thanks to Roland Peelen for finding and reporting this to the crates.io team!
