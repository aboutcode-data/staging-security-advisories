  - CVE-2023-34234
summary: |
  OpenZeppelin Contracts's governor proposal creation may be blocked by frontrunning
  ### Impact

  By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all.

  This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection.

  ### Workarounds

  Submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection.
