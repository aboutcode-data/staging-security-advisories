aliases:
  - CVE-2023-35167
summary: |
  When setting EntityOptions.apiPrefilter to a function, the filter is not applied to API requests for a resource by Id
  ### Impact
  If you used the [apiPrefilter](https://remult.dev/docs/ref_entity.html#apiprefilter) option of the `@Entity` decorator, by setting it to a function that returns a filter that prevents unauthorized access to data, an attacker who knows the `id` of an entity instance she is not authorized to access, can gain read, update and delete access to it.

  ### Patches
  The issue is fixed in version 0.20.6

  ### Workarounds
  Set the `apiPrefilter` option to a filter object instead of a function.

  ### References
  If you're using a minor version < 0.20 and require a patch, please create an issue.
