  - CVE-2025-55197
summary: |
  PyPDF's Manipulated FlateDecode streams can exhaust RAM
  ### Impact
  An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to the RAM being exhausted. This requires just reading the file if a series of FlateDecode filters is used on a malicious cross-reference stream. Other content streams are affected on explicit access.

  ### Patches
  This has been fixed in [pypdf==6.0.0](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.0.0).

  ### Workarounds
  If you cannot upgrade yet, you might want to implement the workaround for `pypdf.filters.decompress` yourself: https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/blob/0dd57738bbdcdb63f0fb43d8a6b3d222b6946595/pypdf/filters.py#L72-L143

  ### References
  This issue has been reported in #3429 and fixed in #3430.
