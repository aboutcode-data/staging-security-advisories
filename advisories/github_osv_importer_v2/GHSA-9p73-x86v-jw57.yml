aliases:
  - CVE-2024-4330
summary: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the parisneo/lollms-webui repository,
  specifically within version 9.6. The vulnerability arises due to improper handling of user-supplied
  input in the 'list_personalities' endpoint. By crafting a malicious HTTP request, an attacker
  can traverse the directory structure and view the contents of any folder, albeit limited to
  subfolder names only. This issue was demonstrated via a specific HTTP request that manipulated
  the 'category' parameter to access arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is present in
  the code located at the 'endpoints/lollms_advanced.py' file.
