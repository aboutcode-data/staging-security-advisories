summary: "Entropy Backdoor in text-qrcode\nAll versions of `text-qrcode` contain malicious code\
  \ that overwrites the `randomBytes` method for the `crypto` module with a function that generates\
  \ weak entropy. Instead of generating 32 bytes, the infected randomBytes will generate 3 bytes\
  \ of entropy and hash them, resulting in a 32 byte value being returned, but one that is easily\
  \ guessable. \n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUninstall `text-qrcode` immediately. If the module\
  \ was used to generate entropy that is load bearing, all such instances of generated entropy\
  \ must be replaced. This includes things like bitcoin wallets, private keys, encrypted messages,\
  \ etc."
