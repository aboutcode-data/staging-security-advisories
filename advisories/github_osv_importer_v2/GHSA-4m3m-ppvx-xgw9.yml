  Session fixation in fastify-passport
  Applications using `@fastify/passport` for user authentication, in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are vulnerable to [session fixation attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation) from network and same-site attackers.

  ## Details
  fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and [same-site attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website.

  ## Fix
  As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session.
