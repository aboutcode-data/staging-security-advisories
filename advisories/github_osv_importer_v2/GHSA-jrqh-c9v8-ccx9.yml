summary: |
  Path traversal in Jenkins build-publisher Plugin
  Jenkins Build-Publisher Plugin 1.22 and earlier allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to create or replace any `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller file system by providing a crafted file name to an API endpoint. Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows attackers to replace any `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller file system with an empty file.

  There is currently no known workaround or fix, and this plugin has been suspended.
