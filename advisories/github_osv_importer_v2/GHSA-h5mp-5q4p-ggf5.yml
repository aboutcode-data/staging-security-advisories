  Prototype Pollution in lodash.defaultsdeep
  Versions of `lodash.defaultsdeep` before 4.6.1 are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The function `mergeWith` may allow a malicious user to modify the prototype of `Object` via `{constructor: {prototype: {...}}}` causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.




  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 4.6.1 or later.
