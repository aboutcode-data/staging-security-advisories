summary: |
  Indico Affected by Cross-Site-Scripting via material uploads
  ### Impact
  There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability when uploading certain file types as materials.

  ### Patches
  You should to update to [Indico 3.3.10](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.10) as soon as possible.
  See [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.

  Please be aware that to apply the fix itself updating is sufficient, but to benefit from the strict Content-Security-Policy we now apply by default for file downloads, you need to update your webserver config in case you use nginx with Indico's `STATIC_FILE_METHOD` set to `xaccelredirect` and add the following line to the `.xsf/indico/` location block (you can consult the Indico setup documentation for the full configuration snippet):

  ```nginx
  add_header Content-Security-Policy $upstream_http_content_security_policy;
  ```

  ### Workarounds
  - Use your webserver config to apply a strict CSP for material download endpoints.
  - Only let trustworthy users create content (including material uploads, which speakers can typically do as well) on Indico.
