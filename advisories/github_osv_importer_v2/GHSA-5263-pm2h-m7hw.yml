summary: |
  Mattermost doesn't restrict which roles can promote a user as system admin
  Mattermost versions 9.9.x <= 9.9.1, 9.5.x <= 9.5.7, 9.10.x <= 9.10.0 and 9.8.x <= 9.8.2 fail to restrict which roles can promote a user as system admin which allows a System Role with edit access to the permissions section of system console to update their role (e.g. member) to include the `manage_system` permission, effectively becoming a System Admin.
