  Cross-Site Scripting in bpmn-js-properties-panel
  Versions of `bpmn-js-properties-panel` prior to 0.31.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to sanitize input in specially configured diagrams, which may allow attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the embedding website.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 0.31.0 or later.
