summary: |
  league/commonmark contains a XSS vulnerability in Attributes extension
  ### Summary
  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the [Attributes extension](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/extensions/attributes/) of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML.

  ### Details

  The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces.

  As a result, even with the secure configuration shown above, an attacker can inject dangerous attributes into applications using this extension via a payload such as:

  ```md
  ![](){onerror=alert(1)}
  ```

  Which results in the following HTML:

  ```html
  <p><img onerror="alert(1)" src="" alt="" /></p>
  ```

  Which causes the JS to execute immediately on page load.

  ### Patches

  Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector:

  - All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default
  - [Support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.7/extensions/attributes/#configuration)
  - Manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option

  ### Workarounds

  If upgrading is not feasible, please consider:

  - Disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users
  - [Filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/security/#additional-filtering)
