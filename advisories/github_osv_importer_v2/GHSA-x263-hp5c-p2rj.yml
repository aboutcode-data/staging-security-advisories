summary: |
  Jenkins OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery
  OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin Plugin 4.5.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to a previously configured Octoperf server using attacker-specified credentials.

  Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin Plugin 4.5.3 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
