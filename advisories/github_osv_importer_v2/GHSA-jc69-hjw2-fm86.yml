aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41828
summary: |
  com.amazon.redshift:redshift-jdbc42 vulnerable to remote command execution
  ### Impact

  A potential remote command execution issue exists within `redshift-jdbc42` versions 2.1.0.7 and below. When plugins are used with the driver, it instantiates plugin instances based on Java class names provided via the `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, and `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. In affected versions, the driver does not verify if a plugin class implements the expected interface before instantiatiaton. This can lead to loading of arbitrary Java classes, which a knowledgeable attacker with control over the JDBC URL can use to achieve remote code execution.

  ### Patches

  This issue is patched within `redshift-jdbc-42` 2.1.0.8 and above.

  ### Workarounds

  We advise customers using plugins to upgrade to `redshift-jdbc42` version 2.1.0.8 or above. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
