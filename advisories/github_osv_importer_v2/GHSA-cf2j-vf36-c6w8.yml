summary: |
  Communities and collections administrators can escalate their privilege up to system administrator
  ### Impact
  Any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator.

  This vulnerability only existed in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below.

  ### Patches
  Fix is included in [7.1](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/releases/tag/dspace-7.1). Please upgrade to 7.1 at your earliest convenience.

  ### Workarounds
  In 7.0, temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings, i.e. set the following properties in your local.cfg / dspace.cfg file
  ```
  core.authorization.collection-admin.policies = false
  core.authorization.community-admin.policies = false
  core.authorization.community-admin.collection.workflows = false
  ```
  Once upgraded to 7.1, these settings can be safely reverted to the default values of `true`.
