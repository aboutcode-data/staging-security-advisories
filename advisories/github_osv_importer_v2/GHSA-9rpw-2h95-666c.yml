  - CVE-2022-2529
summary: |
  Cloudflare GoFlow vulnerable to a Denial of Service in the sflow packet handling package
  ### Impact
  The sflow decode package prior to version 3.4.4 does not employ sufficient packet sanitisation which can lead to a denial of service attack. Attackers can craft malformed packets causing the process to consume huge amounts of memory resulting in a denial of service.

  ### Specific Go Packages Affected
  github.com/cloudflare/goflow/v3/decoders/sflow

  ### Patches
  Version 3.4.4 contains patches fixing this.

  ### Workarounds
  A possible workaround is to not have your goflow collector publicly reachable.
