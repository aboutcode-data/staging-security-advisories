aliases:
  - CVE-2025-22153
summary: |
  try/except* clauses could allow bypass RestrictedPython via type confusion bug in the CPython interpreter
  ### Impact
  Via a type confusion bug in the CPython interpreter when using `try/except*` RestrictedPython could be bypassed.

  We believe this should be fixed upstream in Python itself until that we remove support for `try/except*` from RestrictedPython.
  (It has been fixed for some Python versions.)

  ### Patches
  Patched in version 8.0 by removing support for `try/except*` clauses

  ### Workarounds
  There is no workaround.

  ### References
  none
