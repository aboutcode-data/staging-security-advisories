summary: "org.neo4j.procedure:apoc Path Traversal Vulnerability\n### Impact\nA Path Traversal\
  \ Vulnerability found in the apoc.export.* procedures of apoc plugins in Neo4j Graph database.\n\
  The issue allows a malicious actor to potentially break out of the expected directory. The\
  \ vulnerability is such that files could only be created but not overwritten.\n\nFor the vulnerability\
  \ to be exploited, an attacker would need access to execute an arbitrary query, either by\
  \ having access to an authenticated Neo4j client, or a Cypher injection vulnerability in an\
  \ application. The procedure would need to have been allow listed in the neo4j configuration\
  \ as well as having the apoc config `apoc.export.file.enabled` set to true. \n\nOn a UNIX\
  \ based system the following query allows arbitrary write access to the tmp folder:\n\nCALL\
  \ apoc.export.csv.query('RETURN 1', 'file:///..//..//..//..//tmp/test.txt', {})\n\n### Patches\n\
  The users should aim to use the latest released version compatible with their Neo4j version.\
  \ The minimum versions containing patch for this vulnerability are 4.4.0.12 and 4.3.0.12.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the [allowlist of the\
  \ ](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.security.procedures.allowlist)procedures that\
  \ can be used in your system, and/or turn off local file access by setting apoc.export.file.enabled=false\n\
