summary: "Envoy forwards early CONNECT data in TCP proxy mode\n## Summary\n\nForwarding of early\
  \ CONNECT data in TCP proxy mode.\n\n## Details\n\nPer [RFC 7231-4.3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-4.3.6)\
  \ the sender of CONNECT (and all inbound proxies)  switch to tunnel mode only after receiving\
  \ 2xx response. However in TCP proxy mode, Envoy accepts client data before it has issued\
  \ a 2xx response and eagerly proxies it to an established TCP connection. This creates possibility\
  \ of a de-synchronized tunnel state if a proxy upstream from Envoy responds with a status\
  \ other an 2xx.\n\nThe RFC does not specify the behavior in case an early CONNECT data is\
  \ received and early CONNECT data is common as a latency reduction mechanism. To prevent disruption\
  \ to existing deployments Envoy will by default allow early CONNECT data. Setting the `envoy.reloadable_features.reject_early_connect_data`\
  \ runtime flag to `true` will cause CONNECT requests that send data before 2xx response to\
  \ be rejected. This options should be enabled if there are intermediaries upstream from Envoy\
  \ that may reject establishment of a CONNECT tunnel. \n\n## Impact\n\nDe-synchronization of\
  \ CONNECT tunnel state if a forwarding proxy upstream from Envoy responds with a non 2xx status.\n\
  \n## Attack vector(s)\nSending data for a CONNECT request before receiving 2xx response.\n\
  \n## Patches\nUsers should upgrade to v1.36.3, v1.35.7, v1.34.11 or v1.33.13\n\n## Credits\n\
