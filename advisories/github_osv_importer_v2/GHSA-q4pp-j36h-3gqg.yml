summary: "Minimal `basti` IAM Policy Allows Shell Access\n### Summary\n\nThe provided Minimal\
  \ IAM Policy for `bastic connect` does not include `ssm:SessionDocumentAccessCheck`. This\
  \ results in the ability to get a shell session on the bastion, not just the intended access\
  \ for Port Forwarding.\n\n### Details\n\n`basti connect` is designed to \"securely connect\
  \ to your RDS/Aurora/Elasticache/EC2 instances\", using a bastion instance \"with [AWS Session\
  \ Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html)\
  \ port forwarding capability to make the target available on your localhost.\"\n\nThe [Minimal\
  \ IAM Policy](https://github.com/BohdanPetryshyn/basti#minimal-iam-permissions) allows port\
  \ forwarding via the following statement:\n\n```   \n {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \
  \    \"Action\": \"ssm:StartSession\",\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost\"\
  ,\n        \"arn:aws:ec2:<your-region>:<your-account-id>:instance/<your-basti-instance-id>\"\
  \n      ]\n    }\n```\n\nThis statement does not include the following condition:\n\n```\n\
  \"Condition\": {\n    \"BoolIfExists\": {\n        \"ssm:SessionDocumentAccessCheck\": \"\
  true\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs a result, the `basti connect` minimal policy is logically identical\
  \ to:\n\n```\n {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"ssm:StartSession\",\n\
  \      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost\"\
  ,\n        \"arn:aws:ssm:*:*:document/SSM-SessionManagerRunShell\",\n        \"arn:aws:ec2:<your-region>:<your-account-id>:instance/<your-basti-instance-id>\"\
  \n      ]\n    }\n```\n\nA `basti` admin would expect users under the minimal policy to be\
  \ able to port forward. However, they could also get a shell on the bastion.\n\nFor more details\
  \ on this footgun, see: https://ramimac.me/ssm-iam\n\n### PoC\n_Complete instructions, including\
  \ specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability._\n\n### Impact\n\nImpact\
  \ would depend on configuration/hardening of the bastion. I've seen examples where bastions\
  \ have credentials to downstream systems in configuration or memory that would be exposed."
