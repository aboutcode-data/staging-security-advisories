  tower-http's improper validation of Windows paths could lead to directory traversal attack
  `tower_http::services::fs::ServeDir` didn't correctly validate Windows paths, meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would be allowed and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`. Thus users could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem.

  This only impacts Windows. Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this.

  See [tower-http#204] for more details.
