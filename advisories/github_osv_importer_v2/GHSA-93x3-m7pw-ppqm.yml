  - CVE-2024-34077
summary: "Mantis Bug Tracker (MantisBT) allows user account takeover in the signup/reset password\
  \ process\nInsufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows\
  \ an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account, if the victim has\
  \ an incomplete request pending.\n\nThe exploit is only possible while the verification token\
  \ is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and\
  \ the user did not complete the process by updating their password.\n\nA brute-force attack\
  \ calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. \n \n### Impact\n\nA successful\
  \ takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account, including sensitive\
  \ information and functionalities associated with the account, the extent of which depends\
  \ on its privileges and the data it has access to.\n\n### Patches\n\n92d11a01b195a1b6717a2f205218089158ea6d00\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nMitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change\
  \ the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in *constants_inc.php*).\n\n### References\n\
