summary: "Amazon CloudWatch Agent for Windows has Privilege Escalation Vector\n### Impact\n\
  A privilege escalation issue exists within the Amazon CloudWatch Agent for Windows in versions\
  \ up to and including v1.247354. When users trigger a repair of the Agent, a pop-up window\
  \ opens with SYSTEM permissions. Users with administrative access to affected hosts may use\
  \ this to create a new command prompt as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. \n \nTo trigger this issue,\
  \ the third party must be able to access the affected host and elevate their privileges such\
  \ that they’re able to trigger the agent repair process. They must also be able to install\
  \ the tools required to trigger the issue. \n\nThis issue does not affect the CloudWatch Agent\
  \ for macOS or Linux. \n\n### Patches\nMaintainers recommend that Agent users upgrade to the\
  \ latest available version of the CloudWatch Agent to address this issue. \n\n### Workarounds\n\
  There is no recommended work around. Affected users must update the installed version of the\
  \ CloudWatch Agent to address this issue.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/commit/6119858864c317ff26f41f576c169148d1250837\n\
