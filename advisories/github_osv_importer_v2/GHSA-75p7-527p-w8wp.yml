summary: |
  Server-Side Request Forgery and Open Redirect in AllTube Download
  ### Impact

  On releases prior to 3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured).

  The impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.)

  ### Patches

  3.0.3 contains a fix for this vulnerability.
  (The 1.x and 2.x releases are not maintained anymore.)

  The fix requires applying [a patch](https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/blob/3d092891044f2685ed66c73c870a021bee319c37/patches/youtube-dl-disable-generic.diff) to youtube-dl to disable its generic extractor. If you are using the version of youtube-dl bundled with 3.0.3, it is already patched.
  However, if you are using your own unpatched version of youtube-dl **you might still be vulnerable**.
