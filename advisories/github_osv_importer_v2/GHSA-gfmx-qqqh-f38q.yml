  Duplicate Advisory: Keras vulnerable to arbitrary file read in the model loading mechanism (HDF5 integration)
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-3m4q-jmj6-r34q. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Arbitrary file read in the model loading mechanism (HDF5 integration) in Keras versions 3.0.0 through 3.13.1 on all supported platforms allows a remote attacker to read local files and disclose sensitive information via a crafted .keras model file utilizing HDF5 external dataset references.
