  - CVE-2022-23633
summary: |
  Exposure of information in Action Pack
  ### Impact

  Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a [bug in a webserver](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2812) or a bug in a Rack middleware.  In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request.  This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes`.

  Upgrading to the FIXED versions of Rails will ensure mitigation of this issue even in the context of a buggy webserver or middleware implementation.

  ### Patches

  This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

  ### Workarounds

  Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem the following middleware can be used:

  ```ruby
  class GuardedExecutor < ActionDispatch::Executor
    def call(env)
      ensure_completed!
      super
    end

    private

      def ensure_completed!
        @executor.new.complete! if @executor.active?
      end
  end

  # Ensure the guard is inserted before ActionDispatch::Executor
  Rails.application.configure do
    config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Executor, GuardedExecutor, executor
  end
  ```
