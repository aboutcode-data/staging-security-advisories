summary: "Froxlor username/surname AND company field Bypass\nDear Sirs and Madams,\n\nI would\
  \ like to report a business logic error vulnerability that I discovered during my recent penetration\
  \ test on Froxlor.\n\nSpecifically, I identified an issue where it was possible to submit\
  \ the registration form with the essential fields, such as the username and password, left\
  \ intentionally blank. This inadvertent omission allowed for a bypass of the mandatory field\
  \ requirements established by the system.\n\nThe surname, family name AND company name all\
  \ of them can be left blank.\n\nI believe addressing this vulnerability is crucial to ensure\
  \ the security and integrity of the Froxlor platform.\n\nThank you for your attention to this\
  \ matter.\n\nThis action served as a means to bypass the mandatory field requirements.\n\n\
  Lets see (please have a look at the Video -> attachment).\n\n----------------\n\nas you can\
  \ see i was able to let the username and second name blank. \n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80028768/289675319-81ae8ebe-1308-4ee3-bedb-43cdc40da474.mp4\n\
  \n\nLets see again.\n\nOnly the company name is set. \n\nThank you for your time\n\n![Froxlor\
