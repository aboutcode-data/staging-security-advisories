summary: "Matrix Media Repo (MMR) allows untrusted file formats can be thumbnailed, invoking\
  \ potentially further untrusted decoders\n### Impact\n\nIf SVG or JPEGXL thumbnailers are\
  \ enabled (they are disabled by default), a user may upload a file which claims to be either\
  \ of these types and request a thumbnail to invoke a different decoder in ImageMagick. In\
  \ some ImageMagick installations, this includes the capability to run Ghostscript to decode\
  \ the image/file.\n\nIf MP4 thumbnailers are enabled (also disabled by default), the same\
  \ issue as above may occur with the ffmpeg installation instead.\n\nMMR uses a number of other\
  \ decoders for all other file types when preparing thumbnails. Theoretical issues are possible\
  \ with these decoders, however in testing they were not possible to exploit.\n\n### Patches\n\
  \nThis is fixed in [MMR v1.3.8](https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.3.8).\
  \ MMR now inspects the mimetype of media prior to thumbnailing, and picks a thumbnailer based\
  \ on those results instead of relying on user-supplied values. This may lead to fewer thumbnails\
  \ when obscure file shapes are used. This also helps narrow scope of theoretical issues with\
  \ all decoders MMR uses for thumbnails.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisabling the SVG, JPEGXL, and\
  \ MP4 thumbnail types in the MMR config prevents the decoders from being invoked. Further\
  \ disabling uncommon file types on the server is recommended to limit risk surface. \n\nContainers\
  \ and other similar technologies may also be used to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in\
  \ external decoders, like ImageMagick and ffmpeg. \n\nSome installations of ImageMagick may\
  \ disable \"unsafe\" file types, like PDFs, already. This option can be replicated to other\
  \ environments as needed. ffmpeg may be compiled with limited decoders/codecs. The Docker\
  \ image for MMR disables PDFs and similar formats by default.\n\n### References\n\nA similar\
  \ issue was discovered in Synapse: https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-vp6v-whfm-rv3g"
