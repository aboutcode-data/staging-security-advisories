aliases:
  - CVE-2017-16130
summary: "Directory Traversal in exxxxxxxxxxx\nAffected versions of `exxxxxxxxxxx` resolve relative\
  \ file paths, resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use\
  \ this vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result\
  \ in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\nThis vulnerability is only\
  \ effective for files that have a file extension, which provides a partial mitigation. \n\n\
  **Example request:**\n```http\nGET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n\
  ```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is available for this vulnerability.\n\nIt is recommended\
  \ that the package is only used for local development, and if the functionality is needed\
  \ for production, a different package is used instead."
