summary: |
  Cleartext Signed Message Signature Spoofing in openpgp
  ### Impact
  OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed messages where the signed text is readable without special tools:

  ```
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
  Hash: SHA256

  This text is signed.
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

  wnUEARMIACcFgmTkrNAJkInXCgj0fgcIFiEE1JlKzzDGQxZmmHkYidcKCPR+
  BwgAAKXDAQDWGhI7tPbhB+jlKwe4+yPJ+9X8aWDUG60XFNi/w8T7ZgEAsAGd
  WJrkm/H5AXGZsqyqqO6IWGF0geTCd4mWm/CsveM=
  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
  ```
  These messages typically contain a "Hash: ..." header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute the signature digest.
  OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the "Hash: ..." texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim to believe that the arbitrary text was signed.

  A user or application is vulnerable to said attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned `verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead _visually trusting_ the contents of the original message:

  ```js
  const cleartextMessage = `
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
  This text is not signed but you might think it is. Hash: SHA256

  This text is signed.
  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

  wnUEARMIACcFgmTkrNAJkInXCgj0fgcIFiEE1JlKzzDGQxZmmHkYidcKCPR+
  BwgAAKXDAQDWGhI7tPbhB+jlKwe4+yPJ+9X8aWDUG60XFNi/w8T7ZgEAsAGd
  WJrkm/H5AXGZsqyqqO6IWGF0geTCd4mWm/CsveM=
  -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
  `;
  const message = await openpgp.readCleartextMessage({ cleartextMessage });
  const verificationResult = await verifyCleartextMessage({ message, verificationKeys });
  console.log(await verificationResult.verified); // output: true
  console.log(verificationResult.data); // output: 'This text is signed.'
  ```
  Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the actual signed data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable.
  Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using `getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are considered when verifying the signature.
  Finally, re-armoring a CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a "sanitised" version, with the extraneous text being removed.
  Because of this, we consider the vulnerability impact to be very limited when the CleartextMessage is processed programmatically; this is reflected in the Severity CVSS assessment, specifically in the scope's score ("Unchanged").

  ### Patches
  - v5.10.1 (current stable version) will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()`
  - v4.10.11 (legacy version) will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`

  ### Workarounds
  Check the contents of `verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually trusting the contents of the armored message.
