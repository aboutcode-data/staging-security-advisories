  - CVE-2020-36439
summary: |
  Data races in ticketed_lock
  Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for ReadTicket<T> & WriteTicket<T>. This allows to send non-Send T to other threads. This can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as T of ReadTicket<T>/WriteTicket<T>). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior. The flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding T: Send bounds to Send impls of ReadTicket<T>/WriteTicket<T>.
