aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41247
summary: |
  incomplete JupyterHub logout with simultaneous JupyterLab sessions
  ### Impact

  Users of JupyterLab with JupyterHub who have multiple JupyterLab tabs open in the same browser session, may see incomplete logout from the single-user server, as fresh credentials (for the single-user server only, not the Hub) reinstated after logout, if another active JupyterLab session is open while the logout takes place.

  ### Patches

  Upgrade to JupyterHub 1.5. For distributed deployments, it is jupyterhub in the _user_ environment that needs patching. There are no patches necessary in the Hub environment.

  ### Workarounds

  The only workaround is to make sure that only one JupyterLab tab is open when you log out.
