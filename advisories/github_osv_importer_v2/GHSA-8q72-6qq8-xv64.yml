summary: "phpCAS vulnerable to Service Hostname Discovery Exploitation\n### Impact\n\nThe phpCAS\
  \ library uses HTTP headers to determine the service URL used to validate tickets. This allows\
  \ an attacker to control the host header and use a valid ticket granted for any authorized\
  \ service in the same SSO realm (CAS server) to authenticate to the service protected by phpCAS.\
  \ \nDepending on the settings of the CAS server service registry in worst case this may be\
  \ any other service URL (if the allowed URLs are configured to \"^(https)://.*\") or may be\
  \ strictly limited to known and authorized services in the same SSO federation if proper URL\
  \ service validation is applied.\n\nThis vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain access\
  \ to a victim's account on a vulnerable CASified service without victim's knowledge, when\
  \ the victim visits attacker's website while being logged in to the same CAS server. \n\n\
  ### Patch\n\nphpCAS 1.6.0 is a major version upgrade that starts enforcing service URL discovery\
  \ validation, because there is unfortunately no 100% safe default config to use in PHP. Starting\
  \ this version, it is required to pass in an additional service base URL argument when constructing\
  \ the client class.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the upgrading doc.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nThis vulnerability only impacts the CAS client that the phpCAS library protects against.\
  \ The problematic service URL discovery behavior in phpCAS < 1.6.0 will only be disabled,\
  \ and thus you are not impacted from it, if the phpCAS configuration has the following setup:\n\
  \n1. `phpCAS::setUrl()` is called (a reminder that you have to pass in the full URL of the\
  \ current page, rather than your service base URL), and\n2. `phpCAS::setCallbackURL()` is\
  \ called, only when the proxy mode is enabled.\n3. Alternatively, if your PHP's HTTP header\
  \ input `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Server`, `Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Protocol`\
  \ is sanitized before reaching PHP (by a reverse proxy, for example), you will not be impacted\
  \ by this vulnerability.\n\nOtherwise, you should upgrade the library to get the safe service\
  \ discovery behavior.\n\nIf your CAS server service registry is configured to only allow known\
  \ and trusted service URLs, the severity of the vulnerability is reduced substantially since\
  \ an attacker must be in control of another authorized service.\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\n\
  We would like to thank Filip Hejsek for discovering this vulnerability, responsibly reporting\
  \ it to the developers, and helping harden the patch.\n\nHenry Pan and Joachim Fritschi helped\
  \ with the patch and release effort as phpCAS developers."
