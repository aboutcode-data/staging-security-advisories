  OpenClaw: Skill env override host env injection via applySkillConfigEnvOverrides (defense-in-depth)
  ### Summary
  `applySkillConfigEnvOverrides` previously copied `skills.entries.*.env` values into the host `process.env` without applying the host env safety policy.

  ### Impact
  In affected versions, dangerous process-level variables such as `NODE_OPTIONS` could be injected when unset, which can influence runtime/child-process behavior.

  ### Required attacker capability
  An attacker must be able to modify OpenClaw local state/config (for example `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`) to set `skills.entries.<skill>.env` or related skill config values.

  ### Severity rationale
  Per `SECURITY.md`, anyone who can modify `~/.openclaw` config is already a trusted operator, and mutually untrusted operators sharing one host/config are out of scope. Because exploitation requires trusted-config write access in the documented model, this is classified as a **medium** defense-in-depth issue rather than a cross-boundary critical break.

  ### Remediation
  Fixed in `2026.2.21` by sanitizing skill env overrides and blocking dangerous host env keys (including `NODE_OPTIONS`) before applying overrides, with regression tests covering blocked dangerous keys.
