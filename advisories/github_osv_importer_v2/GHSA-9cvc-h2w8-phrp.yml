summary: "AWS SDK for .NET V4 adopted defense in depth enhancement for region parameter value\n\
  ### Summary\nThis notification is related to the use of specific values for the region input\
  \ field when calling AWS services. An actor with access to the environment in which the SDK\
  \ is used could set the region input field to an invalid value.\n\nA defense-in-depth enhancement\
  \ has been implemented in the AWS SDK for .NET v4. This enhancement validates that a region\
  \ used to construct an endpoint URL is a valid host label. The change was released on Nov\
  \ 21, 2025. This advisory is informational to help customers understand their responsibilities\
  \ regarding configuration security.\n\n### Impact\nCustomer applications could be configured\
  \ to improperly route AWS API calls to non-existent or non-AWS hosts. While the SDK was functioning\
  \ safely within the requirements of the shared responsibility model, additional safeguards\
  \ have been added to support secure customer implementations.\n\nImpacted versions: All versions\
  \ of the AWS SDK for .NET V4 prior to the 4.0.139.0 release (the AWS SDK for .NET V3 was not\
  \ impacted)\n\n### Patches\nOn Nov 21, 2025, an enhancement [1] was made to the AWS SDK for\
  \ .NET v4 release, which validates the formatting of a region, providing additional safeguards.\
  \ \n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are needed, but as always developers should ensure that\
  \ their application is following security best practices:\n- Implement proper input validation\
  \ in your application code\n- Update to the latest AWS SDK for .NET release on a regular basis\n\
  - Follow AWS security best practices [2] for SDK configuration\n\n### References\nContact\
  \ AWS Security via the vulnerability reporting page or email [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\n\
  \n### Acknowledgement\nAWS SDK for .NET v4 thanks Guy Arazi for bringing these customer security\
  \ considerations to our attention through the coordinated disclosure process.\n\n[1] https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/pull/4150\n\
