summary: "CubeFS leaks magic secret key when starting Blobstore access service\nA vulnerability\
  \ was found in CubeFS that could allow users to read sensitive data from the logs which could\
  \ allow them escalate privileges. \n\nCubeFS leaks configuration keys in plaintext format\
  \ in the logs. These keys could allow anyone to carry out operations on blobs that they otherwise\
  \ do not have permissions for. For example, an attacker that has succesfully retrieved a secret\
  \ key from the logs can delete blogs from the blob store.\n\nThe attacker can either be an\
  \ internal user with limited privileges to read the log, or it can be an external user who\
  \ has escalated privileges sufficiently to access the logs. There is no evidence of this vulnerability\
  \ being exploited in the wild. It was found during an ongoing security audit carried out by\
  \ [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/) in collaboration with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and\
  \ the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in v3.3.1. There\
  \ is no other mitigated than upgrading."
