summary: |
  sudo-rs: Partial password reveal is possible after timeout
  ### Summary
  If a user begins entering a password but does not press return for an extended period, a password timeout may occur. When this happens, the keystrokes that were entered are echoed back to the console.

  ### Example
  Using sudo-rs:
  ```
  geiger@cerberus:~$ sudo -s
  [sudo: authenticate] Password: sudo-rs: timed out
  geiger@cerberus:~$ testtesttest
  ```

  "testtesttest" was entered at the password prompt but not confirmed by pressing return and then waiting for the timeout.

  ### Impact
  This could reveal partial password information, possibly exposing history files when not carefully handled by the user and on screen, usable for Social Engineering or Pass-By attacks.

  ### Versions affected
  Passwords timeouts were added in sudo-rs 0.2.7 (with a default set to 5 minutes).

  ### Credits
  This issue was discovered and reported by @DevLaTron.
