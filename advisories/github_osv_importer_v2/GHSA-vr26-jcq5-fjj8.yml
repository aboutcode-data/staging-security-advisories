summary: |
  Denial of service in quinn-proto when using `Endpoint::retry()`
  ### Summary

  As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:

  - Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received
    - This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack.
  - Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received.
    - This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved.

  The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.

  ### Details
