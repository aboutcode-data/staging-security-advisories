summary: "Stack overflow due to looping TFLite subgraph\n### Impact\nTFlite graphs must not\
  \ have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could\
  \ craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the\
  \ infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls.\n\nFor\
  \ example, the [`While` implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc)\
  \ could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same.\
  \ Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this\
  \ quickly exhaust all stack space.\n    \n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub\
  \ commit [9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9c1dc920d8ffb4893d6c9d27d1f039607b326743)\
  \ (for the `While` operator) and in GitHub commit [c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c6173f5fe66cdbab74f4f869311fe6aae2ba35f4)\
  \ (in general).\n    \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick\
  \ this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,\
  \ as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease\
  \ consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and\
  \ questions.\n\n### Attribution \nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul\
  \ Team from Qihoo 360."
