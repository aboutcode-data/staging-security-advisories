  Moodle allows attackers to modify the visibility of a badge
  badges/mybadges.php in Moodle 2.5.x before 2.5.5 and 2.6.x before 2.6.2 does not properly track the user to whom a badge was issued, which allows remote authenticated users to modify the visibility of an arbitrary badge via unspecified vectors.
