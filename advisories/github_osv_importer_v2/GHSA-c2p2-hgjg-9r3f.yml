summary: "Crayfish Allows Remote Code Execution via hypercube X-Islandora-Args Header\n### Impact\n\
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nRemote code execution is possible\
  \ in web-accessible installations of hypercube. \n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?\
  \ What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nNot yet, though no patch is neccessary if your\
  \ installation of the microservices is behind a firewall.  See below.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nThe\
  \ exploit requires making a request against Hypercube's endpoints; therefore, the ability\
  \ to make use of the exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible\
  \ from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Hypercube.\
  \  Furthermore, if you've used any of the official installation methods, your Crayfish will\
  \ be behind a firewall and there is no work neccessary.\n\nThe webserver might be made to\
  \ validate the structure of headers passed, but that would only be neccessary if you publicly\
  \ exposed the endpoint. Standard security practices should be applied.\n\n### References\n\
  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n- XBOW-024-074"
