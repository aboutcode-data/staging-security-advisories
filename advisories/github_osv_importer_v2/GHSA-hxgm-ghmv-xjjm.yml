summary: "Directus incorrectly handles `_in` filter\n### Summary\nDirectus >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3\
  \ improperly handles _in, _nin operators.\nIt evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions\
  \ like {\"role\": {\"_in\": $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the\
  \ request to pass.\n\n### Details\nThis results in Broken Access Control because the rule\
  \ fails to do what it was intended to do: Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**.\
  \ ref: https://docs.directus.io/reference/filter-rules.html#filter-operators\nIn my example\
  \ this would translate to \"Pass rule if **<collection>.role** matches any of **[]**\". Which\
  \ should fail. This instead passes in Directus <= v10.5.3, >=v9.23.0\n\n### PoC\n{\"role\"\
  : {\"_in\": $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} field validation would pass if $CURRENT_USER.some_field\
  \ is null.\n\nReal scenario: Using https://github.com/u12206050/directus-extension-role-chooser\
  \ with the specified versions of Directus (I tested on 10.0.0) allows users with access to\
  \ this feature set their role to whatever role if they don't have any roles assigned (user_roles.role\
  \ is left with the default value, null) despite the validation rule being \n```yaml\nvalidation:\n\
  \    role:\n      _in: $CURRENT_USER.user_roles.role\n```\nLatest version of Directus (v10.8.3\
  \ and above) handles the above validation rule correctly.\n\n### Impact\nPermissions fail\
  \ to open for setups relying on this filter and can lead to users getting access to things\
  \ they're not supposed to."
