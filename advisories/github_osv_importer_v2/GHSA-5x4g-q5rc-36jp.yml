  Etcd pkg Insecure ciphers are allowed by default
  ### Vulnerability type
  Cryptography

  ### Detail
  The TLS ciphers list supported by etcd contains insecure cipher suites. Users can configure the desired ciphers using the “--cipher-suites” flag, and a default list of secure cipher suites is used if empty.

  ### Workarounds
  By default, no action is required. If users want to specify cipher suites using the '--cipher-suites' flag, they should try not to specify insecure cipher suites. Please refer to the [security documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/op-guide/security/).
