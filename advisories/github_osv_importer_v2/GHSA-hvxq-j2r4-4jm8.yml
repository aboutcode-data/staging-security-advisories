  Regular Expression Denial of Service in sql-injection
  All versions of `sql-injection` are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service. The package processes a request's body with regular expressions that may take exponentially longer to execute for large inputs.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
