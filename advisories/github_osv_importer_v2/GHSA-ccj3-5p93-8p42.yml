summary: "SurrealDB server-takeover via SurrealQL injection on backup import\nThe SurrealDB\
  \ command-line tool allows exporting databases through the `export` command. It was discovered\
  \ that table or field names are not properly sanitized in exports, leading to a SurrealQL\
  \ injection when the backup is reimported.\n\nFor the injection to occur, an authenticated\
  \ System User with `OWNER` or `EDITOR` roles needs to create tables or fields with malicious\
  \ names containing SurrealQL, subsequently exported using the `export` operation\n\nThe attacker\
  \ could achieve a privilege escalation and root level access to the SurrealDB instance if\
  \ a higher privileged user subsequently performs the `import` operation. \n\nFurthermore,\
  \ applications using SurrealDB that allow its users to define custom fields or tables are\
  \ at risk of a universal second order SurrealQL injection, even if query parameters are properly\
  \ sanitized. \n\nThis issue was discovered and patched during an code audit and penetration\
  \ test of SurrealDB by cure53, the severity defined within cure53's preliminary finding is\
  \ Critical, matched by our CVSS v4 assessment.\n\n### Impact\nThis attack can be used to perform\
  \ privilege escalation and complete takeover (root access) of the SurrealDB instance, as well\
  \ as being able to perform SurrealQL injection attacks against co-tenanted applications where\
  \ SurrealDB is used as a shared backend for multiple applications.\n\n### Patches\nA patch\
  \ has been created that addresses the issue by fixing the bugs in the exporter which failed\
  \ to escape some characters properly.\n\n- Versions 2.0.5, 2.1.5, 2.2.2 and later are not\
  \ affected by this issue.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nFor SurrealDB users that are unable to upgrade,\
  \ users that are looking to perform `import` operations must manually inspect the exported\
  \ data for injected statements, prior to importing. \n\n\n### References\n[SurrealDB Documentation\
  \ - Export](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/cli/export)\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Import](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/cli/import)\n\
