  - CVE-2022-24732
summary: |
  Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date and Insufficient Session Expiration in Maddy Mail Server
  ### Impact

  Any configuration on any maddy version <0.5.4 using auth.pam is affected.

  No password expiry or account expiry checking is done when authenticating using PAM.

  ### Patches

  Patch is available as part of the 0.5.4 release.

  ### Workarounds

  If /etc/shadow authentication is used, it is possible to replace auth.pam with auth.shadow which is not affected.

  It is possible to blacklist expired accounts via existing filtering mechanisms (e.g. auth_map to invalid accounts in storage.imapsql).
