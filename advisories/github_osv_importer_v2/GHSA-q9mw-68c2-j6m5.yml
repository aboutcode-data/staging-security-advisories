summary: |
  engine.io Uncaught Exception vulnerability
  ### Impact

  A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process.

  ```
  TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handlesUpgrades')
      at Server.onWebSocket (build/server.js:515:67)
  ```

  This impacts all the users of the [`engine.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/engine.io) package, including those who uses depending packages like [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io).

  ### Patches

  A fix has been released today (2023/05/02): [6.4.2](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/6.4.2)

  This bug was introduced in version 5.1.0 and included in version 4.1.0 of the `socket.io` parent package. Older versions are not impacted.

  For `socket.io` users:
