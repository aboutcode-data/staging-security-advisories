summary: "prebuild-lwip downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `prebuild-lwip`\
  \ insecurely download resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged\
  \ network position, they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity\
  \ of impact for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of\
  \ the package itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all the way\
  \ up to and including remote code execution.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently\
  \ available for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this\
  \ package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation\
  \ can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public\
  \ network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit\
  \ this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged\
  \ access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
