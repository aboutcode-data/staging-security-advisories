aliases:
  - CVE-2021-41251
summary: |
  Unauthorized access to data in @sap-cloud-sdk/core
  ### Impact
  This affects applications on SAP Business Technology Platform that use the SAP Cloud SDK and enabled caching of destinations.
  In some cases, when user information was missing, destinations were cached without user information, allowing other users to retrieve the same destination with its permissions.
  By default, destination caching is disabled. If it is enabled the maximum lifetime is 5 minutes which limits the attack vector.

  ### Patches
  The problem was fixed by #1769 and #1770. The security for caching has been increased. The changes are released in version 1.52.0.

  ### Workarounds
  Disable destination caching (it is disabled by default).
