aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41249
summary: |
  Jenkins SCM HttpClient Plugin vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  SCM HttpClient Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform permission check in a method implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
