  Path Traversal in swagger-injector
  All versions of `swagger-injector` are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to sanitize URLs, allowing attackers to access server files outside of the configured `dist` folder using relative paths.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
