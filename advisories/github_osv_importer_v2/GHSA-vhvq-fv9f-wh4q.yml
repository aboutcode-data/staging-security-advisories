summary: "LookupResources Cursor section tampering can crash SpiceDB process via tuple.MustParse\
  \ panic\n## Description\nA malformed or tampered-with LookupResources [Cursor token](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.Cursor)\
  \ can cause a panic in the SpiceDB process if it fails to parse. If an attacker were able\
  \ to make requests to a SpiceDB instance, they could affect its availability.\n\n## Reproduction\n\
  If one was to take a cursor from a LookupResources call, decode it according to the logic\
  \ that SpiceDB uses, and modify the Sections field to include an invalid relationship string,\
  \ the process will panic.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker would need both the ability to create\
  \ a gRPC connection to your SpiceDB instance and a valid token, or else the ability to pass\
  \ a cursor token from outside your application through to your SpiceDB instance.\n\nIf an\
  \ attacker had this ability, they could bring down SpiceDB instances, reducing the availability\
  \ of SpiceDB and any service that depends on it.\n\n## Mechanism\nThe SpiceDB process does\
  \ not validate the contents of this `Sections` component of the `Cursor` message. In affected\
  \ versions, it uses a parsing function that calls `panic` if the value cannot be parsed as\
  \ a relationship. \n\n## Fix\nThis issue was fixed in https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/2878.\n\
  \n## Remediations\n* Prevent client control of the `optional_cursor` field in `LookupResources`\
  \ calls\n* Upgrade to an unaffected version"
