summary: "Octokit gem published with world-writable files\n### Impact\n\nVersions [4.23.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.23.0)\
  \ and [4.24.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.24.0) of the octokit gem were\
  \ published containing world-writeable files. \n\nSpecifically, the gem was packed with files\
  \ having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644).\
  \ This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance\
  \ where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem.\
  \ \n\nMalicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this package,\
  \ could modify the gem’s files and change its behavior during runtime.\n\n### Patches\n* [octokit\
  \ 4.25.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.25.0)\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can\
  \ use the previous version of the gem [v4.22.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.22.0).\
  \ Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade\
  \ to the latest version."
