summary: |
  Lack of authentication mechanism for webhook in CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin
  CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin provides several webhook endpoints that can be used to trigger builds when Docker images used by a job have been rebuilt.

  In CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin 2.6.2 and earlier, these endpoints can be accessed without authentication.

  This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified repository.

  CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification Plugin 2.6.2.1 requires a token as a part of webhook URLs, which will act as authentication for the webhook endpoint. As a result, all webhook URLs in the plugin will be different after updating the plugin.

  Administrators can set the [Java system](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) property `org.jenkinsci.plugins.registry.notification.webhook.JSONWebHook.DO_NOT_REQUIRE_API_TOKEN` to `true` to disable this fix.
