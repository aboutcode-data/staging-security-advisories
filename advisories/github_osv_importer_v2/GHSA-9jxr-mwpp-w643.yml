  Improper header validation in httpsoft/http-message
  ### Impact

  Improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a newline (`\n`) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that `\r\n\r\n` is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept `\n\n`.

  ### Patches

  The issue is patched in 1.0.12.

  ### Workarounds

  There are no known workarounds.
