  Command Injection in meta-git
  All versions of `meta-git` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `clone` command is vulnerable through the branch name.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
