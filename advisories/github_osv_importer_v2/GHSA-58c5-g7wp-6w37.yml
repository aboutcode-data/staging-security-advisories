summary: "Angular is Vulnerable to XSRF Token Leakage via Protocol-Relative URLs in Angular\
  \ HTTP Client\nThe vulnerability is a **Credential Leak by App Logic** that leads to the **unauthorized\
  \ disclosure of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) token** to an attacker-controlled domain.\n\
  \nAngular's HttpClient has a built-in XSRF protection mechanism that works by checking if\
  \ a request URL starts with a protocol (`http://` or `https://`) to determine if it is cross-origin.\
  \ If the URL starts with protocol-relative URL (`//`), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin\
  \ request, and the XSRF token is automatically added to the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header.\n\n###\
  \ Impact\nThe token leakage completely bypasses Angular's built-in CSRF protection, allowing\
  \ an attacker to capture the user's valid XSRF token. Once the token is obtained, the attacker\
  \ can perform arbitrary Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against the victim user's\
  \ session.\n\n### Attack Preconditions\n1. The victim's Angular application must have **XSRF\
  \ protection enabled**.  \n2. The attacker must be able to make the application send a state-changing\
  \ HTTP request (e.g., `POST`) to a **protocol-relative URL**  (e.g., `//attacker.com`) that\
  \ they control.\n\n### Patches\n- 19.2.16\n- 20.3.14\n- 21.0.1\n\n### Workarounds\nDevelopers\
  \ should avoid using protocol-relative URLs (URLs starting with `//`) in HttpClient requests.\
  \ All backend communication URLs should be hardcoded as relative paths (starting with a single\
  \ `/`) or fully qualified, trusted absolute URLs."
