  Cross-Site Scripting in ids-enterprise
  Versions of `ids-enterprise` prior to 4.18.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `modal` component fails to sanitize input to the `title` attribute, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 4.18.2 or later
