  \ advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6r92-cgxc-r5fg. This link\
  \ is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nPeterO.Cbor\
  \ versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0 are vulnerable to a denial of \nservice vulnerability. An attacker\
  \ may trigger the denial of service \ncondition by providing crafted data to the DecodeFromBytes\
  \ or other \ndecoding mechanisms in PeterO.Cbor. Depending on the usage of the \nlibrary,\
  \ an unauthenticated and remote attacker may be able to cause the\n denial of service condition."
