summary: "Besu VM vulnerable to gas allocation error in CALL operations\n### Impact\nAn error\
  \ in 32 bit signed and unsigned types in the calculation of available gas in the CALL operations\
  \ (including DELEGATECALL) results in incorrect gas being passed into called contracts and\
  \ incorrect gas being returned after call execution.  Where the amount of gas makes a difference\
  \ in the success or failure, or if the gas is a negative 64 bit value, the execution will\
  \ result in a different state root than expected, resulting in a consensus failure in networks\
  \ with multiple EVM implementations. \n\nIn networks with a single EVM implementation this\
  \ can be used to execute with significantly more gas than then transaction requested, possibly\
  \ exceeding gas limitations. \n\n### Patches\nVersion 22.7.1 contains a fix, ensuring that\
  \ excess gas will not be allocated to inner transaction calls and correcting the excess gas\
  \ errors.\n\n### Workarounds\nReverting to version 22.1.3 or earlier will prevent incorrect\
  \ execution. However many ethereum mainnet networks require changes in more recent versions\
  \ of Besu and should not use older versions of besu and should instead use the patched version.\
  \  \n\nEthereum Classic and other networks not depending on a Proof of Stake transition should\
  \ function fine with version 22.1.3 or earlier.\n\n### For more information\nIssue was found\
  \ by [Martin Holst Swende](https://github.com/holiman) using [goevmlab](https://github.com/holiman/goevmlab),\
  \ it is believed that no production networks have transactions that would trigger this failure."
