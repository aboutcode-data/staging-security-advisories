  Leantime allows Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  ### Description
  Leantime allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in the API key name while generating the API key.

  ### Impact
  Any low privileged user like manager, or editor, can create an API key with XSS payload. When admin will visit the Company page, the XSS will automatically get triggerred leading to the unauthorized action performed from the ADMIN account. Like, removing any user, or adding someone else as high privilege, and many more.
