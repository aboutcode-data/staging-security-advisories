aliases:
  - CVE-2020-8162
summary: |
  Circumvention of file size limits in ActiveStorage
  There is a vulnerability in ActiveStorage's S3 adapter that allows the Content-Length of a direct file upload to be modified by an end user.

  Versions Affected:  rails < 5.2.4.2, rails < 6.0.3.1
  Not affected:       Applications that do not use the direct upload functionality of the ActiveStorage S3 adapter.
  Fixed Versions:     rails >= 5.2.4.3, rails >= 6.0.3.1

  Impact
  ------

  Utilizing this vulnerability, an attacker can control the Content-Length of an S3 direct upload URL without receiving a new signature from the server. This could be used to bypass controls in place on the server to limit upload size.

  Workarounds
  -----------

  This is a low-severity security issue. As such, no workaround is necessarily until such time as the application can be upgraded.
