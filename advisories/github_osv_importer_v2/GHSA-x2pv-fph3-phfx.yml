summary: |
  Jenkins Nexus Task Runner Plugin vulnerable to cross-site request forgery
  Jenkins Nexus Task Runner Plugin 0.9.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password.

  Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
