  - CVE-2025-64529
summary: |
  SpiceDB WriteRelationships fails silently if payload is too big
  ### Impact

  Users who:
  1. Use the exclusion operator somewhere in their authorization schema.
  1. Have configured their SpiceDB server such that `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` is bigger than 6500.
  1. Issue calls to WriteRelationships with a large enough number of updates that cause the payload to be bigger than what their datastore allows.

  Users will:

  1. Receive a successful response from their `WriteRelationships` call, when in reality that call failed.
  2. Receive incorrect permission check results, if those relationships had to be read to resolve the relation involving the exclusion.

  ### Patches

  Upgrade to v.145.2.

  ### Workarounds

  Set `--write-relationships-max-updates-per-call` to `1000`.
