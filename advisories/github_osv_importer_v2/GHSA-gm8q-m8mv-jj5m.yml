summary: |
  Unstructured has Path Traversal via Malicious MSG Attachment that Allows Arbitrary File Write
  A Path Traversal vulnerability in the `partition_msg` function allows an attacker to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem when processing malicious MSG files with attachments.

    ## Impact
    An attacker can craft a malicious .msg file with attachment filenames containing path traversal sequences (e.g.,
    `../../../etc/cron.d/malicious`). When processed with `process_attachments=True`, the library writes the attachment to an
    attacker-controlled path, potentially leading to:

    - Arbitrary file overwrite
    - Remote code execution (via overwriting configuration files, cron jobs, or Python packages)
    - Data corruption
    - Denial of service

    ## Affected Functionality
    The vulnerability affects the MSG file partitioning functionality when `process_attachments=True` is enabled.

    ## Vulnerability Details
    The library does not sanitize attachment filenames in MSG files before using them in file write operations, allowing directory
    traversal sequences to escape the intended output directory.

    ## Workarounds
    Until patched, users can:
    - Set `process_attachments=False` when processing untrusted MSG files
    - Avoid processing MSG files from untrusted sources
    - Implement additional filename validation before processing
