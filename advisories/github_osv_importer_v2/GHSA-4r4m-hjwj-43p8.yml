aliases:
  - CVE-2016-10536
summary: "Insecure Defaults Allow MITM Over TLS in engine.io-client\nAffected versions of `engine.io-client`\
  \ do not verify certificates by default, and as such may be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle\
  \ attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized`\
  \ setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, such as undefined or null, certificate\
  \ verification will be disabled. \n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.6.9 or later.\n\
  \nIf you are unable to upgrade, ensure all calls to socket.io to have a `rejectedUnauthorized:\
  \ true` flag."
