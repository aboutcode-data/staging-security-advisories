  Out-of-bounds Read in npmconf
  Versions of `npmconf` before 2.1.3 allocate and write to disk uninitialized memory contents when a typed number is passed as input on Node.js 4.x.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 2.1.3 or later. Consider switching to another config storage mechanism, as npmconf is deprecated and should not be used.
