  - CVE-2022-34780
summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins XebiaLabs XL Release Plugin allow capturing credentials
  XebiaLabs XL Release Plugin 22.0.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  XebiaLabs XL Release Plugin 22.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.
