summary: "Vitess allows HTML injection in /debug/querylogz & /debug/env\n### Summary\n\nThe\
  \ `/debug/querylogz` and `/debug/env` pages for `vtgate` and `vttablet` do not properly escape\
  \ user input. The result is that queries executed by Vitess can write HTML into the monitoring\
  \ page at will.\n\n### Details\n\nThese pages are rendered using `text/template` instead of\
  \ rendering with a proper HTML templating engine.\n\n### PoC\n\nExecute any query where part\
  \ of it is HTML markup, for example as part of a string. To make it easier to observe you\
  \ might want to make sure the query takes a few seconds to complete, giving you time to refresh\
  \ the status page. \n\nExample query that can trigger the issue:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE users\n\
  SET\n    email = CONCAT(\"<img src=https://cataas.com/cat/says/oops>\", users.idUser, \"@xxx\"\
  )\nWHERE\n    email NOT LIKE '%xxx%' AND email != \"demo@xxx.com\"\n```\n\nResult: \n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c583816b-157c-474e-bbed-152b3dc0372f)\n\
  \n### Impact\n\nAnyone looking at the Vitess status page is affected. This would normally\
  \ be owners / administrators of the Vitess cluster.\n\nAnyone that can influence what text\
  \ show up in queries can trigger it. This would normally be pretty much everybody interacting\
  \ with a system that uses Vitess as a backend."
