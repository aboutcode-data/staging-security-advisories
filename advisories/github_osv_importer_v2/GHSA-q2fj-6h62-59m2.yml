summary: "Apiman Vert.x Gateway has Transitive Hazelcast connection caching issue\n### Impact\n\
  \nIf you are using the **Apiman Vert.x Gateway** prior to Apiman 3.0.0.Final, a connection\
  \ caching issue in Hazelcast could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access and\
  \ manipulate data in the cluster with another authenticated connection's identity.\n\nHazelcast\
  \ is a transitive dependency of the Apiman Vert.x Gateway.\n\nThe precise risk is difficult\
  \ to quantify at this juncture as plugins deployed by users may make use of Hazelcast in a\
  \ different manner to the main Apiman codebase.\n\nIf any of your custom Apiman plugins specify\
  \ Hazelcast dependencies, you should also bump these versions. \n\nHint: an easy way to track\
  \ Apiman dependency versions is to use `apiman-parent`.\n\nIf you use the Apiman Tomcat or\
  \ WildFly Gateway this does not affect you.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to **Apiman 3.0.0.Final\
  \ or later**.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Apiman and need to remain on that version,\
  \ contact to your Apiman support provider for advice/long-term support.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nNone (other than doing your own build).\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c5hg-mr8r-f6jp"
