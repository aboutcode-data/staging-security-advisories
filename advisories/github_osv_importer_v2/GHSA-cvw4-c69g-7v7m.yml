summary: "Inclusion of Untrusted polyfill.io Code Vulnerability in fides.js\n### Note\n\nOn\
  \ Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure\
  \ `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering\
  \ this vulnerability **unexploitable**.\n\nThe following sections describe this vulnerability\
  \ prior to the domain level intervention, when it was still exploitable.\n\n### Impact\n\n\
  `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of\
  \ Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy\
  \ browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard.\n\nOn June 25th, 2024, Sansec\
  \ published the following regarding the `polyfill.io` domain.\n\n> The polyfill.js is a popular\
  \ open source library to support older browsers. 100K+ sites embed it using the cdn.polyfill.io\
  \ domain... However, in February this year, a Chinese company bought the domain and the Github\
  \ account. Since then, this domain was caught injecting malware on mobile devices via any\
  \ site that embeds cdn.polyfill.io.\n\nTherefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017\
  \ browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts\
  \ from the compromised domain.\n\nNo exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been\
  \ identified at this time, but other script developers who use `https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js`\
  \ have reported redirects to malicious websites.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been\
  \ patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later\
  \ to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPrior to the domain level\
  \ intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity,\
  \ and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. \n\nClients could ensure they\
  \ were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard. caniuse.com/fetch\
  \ estimates that 97.52% of browser users use a browser that supports the fetch standard.\n\
