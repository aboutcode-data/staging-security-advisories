  Cross-Site Scripting in express-cart
  All versions of `harp` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. In the admin page it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript as a new product option, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. This is limited to the admin page and does not affect other pages.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
