summary: |
  Improper Privilege Management in Concrete CMS
  Privilege escalation from Editor to Admin using Groups in Concrete CMS versions 8.5.6 and below. If a group is granted "view" permissions on the bulkupdate page, then users in that group can escalate to being an administrator with a specially crafted curl. Fixed by adding a check for group permissions before allowing a group to be moved.
