summary: |
  Navidrome Parameter Tampering vulnerability
  ### Summary
  Parameter tampering is a vulnerability where an attacker has the ability to manipulate parameter values in the HTTP requests.

  ### Details
  The attacker is able to change the parameter values in the body and successfully impersonate another user. In this case, the attacker created a playlist, added song, posted arbitrary comment, set the playlist to be public, and put the admin as the owner of the playlist.

  ### Impact
  Each known user is impacted. An attacker can obtain the ownerId from shared playlist information, meaning every user who has shared a playlist is also impacted, as they can be impersonated.
