  Cross-Site Scripting in webpack-bundle-analyzer
  Versions of `webpack-bundle-analyzer` prior to 3.3.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The package uses `JSON.stringify()` without properly escaping input which may lead to Cross-Site Scripting.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 3.3.2 or later.
