  - CVE-2024-31990
summary: "Argo CD's API server does not enforce project sourceNamespaces\n### Impact\n\nI can\
  \ convince the UI to let me do things with an invalid Application.\n1. Admin gives me `p,\
  \ michael, applications, *, demo/*, allow`, where `demo` can just deploy to the `demo` namespace\n\
  2. Admin gives me AppProject `dev` which reconciles from ns `dev-apps`\n3. Admin gives me\
  \ `p, michael, applications, sync, dev/*, allow`, i.e. no updating via the UI allowed, gitops-only\n\
  4. I create an Application called `pwn` in `dev-apps` with project dev and sync the app with\
  \ sources from git\n5. I change the Application’s project to demo via kubectl or gitops (whichever\
  \ mechanism my admins have given me, because it should be safe)\n6. I use the UI to edit the\
  \ resource which should only be mutable via gitops\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability\
  \ has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\nv2.10.7 \nv2.9.12 \nv2.8.16\n\n\
