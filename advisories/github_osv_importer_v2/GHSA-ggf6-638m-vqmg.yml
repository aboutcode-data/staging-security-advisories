aliases:
  - CVE-2022-36110
summary: |
  Netmaker vulnerable to Insufficient Granularity of Access Control
  ### Impact
  Improper Authorization functions leads to non-privileged users running privileged API calls. If you have added users to your Netmaker platform who whould not have admin privileges, they could use their auth token to run admin-level functions via the API.

  In addition, differing response codes based on function calls allowed non-users to potentially brute force the determination of names of networks on the system.

  ### Patches
  This problem has been patched in v0.15.1. To apply:

  1. docker-compose down
  2. docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.15.1
  3. docker-compose up -d
