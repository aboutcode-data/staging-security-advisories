aliases:
  - CVE-2023-37900
summary: |
  Denial of service from large image
  ### Impact

  An high-privileged user could create a Package referencing an arbitrarily large image containing that Crossplane would then parse, possibly resulting in exhausting all the available memory and therefore in the container being OOMKilled.

  The impact is low due to the high privileges required to be able to create the Package and the eventually consistency nature of controller.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed in 1.11.5, 1.12.3 and 1.13.0, all the supported versions of Crossplane at the time of writing.

  ### Workarounds

  Only using images from trusted sources and keeping Package editing/creating privileges to administrators only, which should be both considered already best practices.
