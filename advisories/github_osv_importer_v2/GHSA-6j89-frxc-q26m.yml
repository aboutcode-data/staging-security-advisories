summary: "@strapi/plugin-content-manager leaks data via relations via the Admin Panel\n### Summary\n\
  1. If a super admin creates a collection where an item in the collection has an association\
  \ to another collection, a user with the Author Role can see the list of associated items\
  \ they did not create. They should only see their own items that they created, not all items\
  \ ever created.\n\n### Details\nAt the top level every collection shows blank items for an\
  \ Author if they did not create the item. This is ideal and works great. However if you associate\
  \ one private collection to another private collection and an Author creates a new item. The\
  \ pull down should not show the admins list of previously created items. It should be blank\
  \ unitl they add their own items.\n\n### PoC\n1. Sign in as Admin. Navigate to content creation.\n\
  2. Select a collection and verify you have items you created there. And that they have associations\
  \ to other protected collections.\n3. Verify role permissions for your collections are set\
  \ to CRUD if user created.\n4. Log out and sign in as a unrelated Author.\n5. Navigate to\
  \ content management and verify you see collections built by admin but empty for you (as expected)\n\
  6. Create a new item as an Author and see the card appear with attributes to fill out.\n7.\
  \ Use the form pull down for the associations.\n8. Notice that protected collection items\
  \ from Admin appear in drop down. These should be hidden\n\n### Impact\nSecurity vulnerability\
  \ where authors have access to protected data created by admin. This could be passwords emails\
  \ or any other item created for the admin's collection. \n\nSee images below for more context\n\
