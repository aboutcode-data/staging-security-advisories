summary: "Reliance on Cookies without validation in OctoberCMS\n### Impact\nPreviously encrypted\
  \ cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant\
  \ that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities\
  \ in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance\
  \ of succeeding. \n\nSpecifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered\
  \ user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided\
  \ search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more\
  \ tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted\
  \ cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from\
  \ your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it\
  \ for them. \n\n### Patches\nIssue has been patched in Build 468 (v1.0.468).\n\n>**NOTE**:\
  \ If you are using the cookie session driver, all of your session data will be invalidated.\
  \ All other session drivers should smoothly upgrade to the changes (although the backend authentication\
  \ persist cookie will also be invalidated requiring users to login again once their current\
  \ session expires).\n\n### Workarounds\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/28310d4fb336a1741b39498f4474497644a6875c\
  \ to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 468.\n\n### References\n- https://blog.laravel.com/laravel-cookie-security-releases\n\

  \ Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n\n### Threat Assessment\n\
  Assessed as Low given that it is not directly exploitable within the core but requires other\
  \ security vulnerabilities within the application to have an effect and the severity of its\
  \ effect depends entirely on the severity of those other holes in the application's defences.\n\
