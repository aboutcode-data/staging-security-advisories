summary: |
  Implementation trusts the "me" field returned by the authorization server without verifying it
  ### Impact

  A malicious user can sign in as a user with any IndieAuth identifier. This is because the implementation does not verify that the final `"me"` URL value returned by the authorization server belongs to the same domain as the initial value entered by the user.

  ### Patches

  Version 1.1 fixes this issue.

  ### Workarounds

  There is no workaround. Upgrade to 1.1 immediately.

  ### References
