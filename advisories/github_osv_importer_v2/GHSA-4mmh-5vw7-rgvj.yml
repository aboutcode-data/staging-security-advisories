summary: "Venice vulnerable to Partial Path Traversal issue within the functions `load-file`\
  \ and `load-resource`\n### Impact\nA partial path traversal issue exists within the functions\
  \ `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list\
  \ of load paths.\n\nAssuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"/Users/foo/resources\"\
  \ ]` \n\nWhen passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine:\n\
  `(load-resource \"test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\n`(load-resource\
  \ \"../resources-alt/test.png\")`   => rejected, outside the load path\n\nWhen passing **absolute**\
  \ paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load\
  \ paths:\n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\
  \n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\"\
  \ !!!\nThe latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability.\n\nThis issue’s\
  \ scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path\
  \ `\"/Users/foo/resources\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"\
  `, but not from `\"/Users/foo/images\"`.\n\nVersions of Venice before and including v1.10.16\
  \ are affected by this issue.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Venice >= 1.10.17, if you are on\
  \ a version < 1.10.17\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control\
  \ the functions that can be used in Venice with a sandbox. If it is appropriate, the functions\
  \ `load-file` and `load-resource` can be blacklisted in the sandbox.\n\n### References\n \
