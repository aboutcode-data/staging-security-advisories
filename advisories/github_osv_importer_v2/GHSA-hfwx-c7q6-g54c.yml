summary: "Vulnerability allowing for reading internal HTTP resources\n### Impact\n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ allows for reading and outputting files served by other services on the internal network\
  \ in which the export server is hosted. If the export server is exposed to the internet, this\
  \ potentially allows a malicious user to gain read access to internal web-resources.\n\nThe\
  \ impact is limited to internal services that serve content via. HTTP(S), and requires the\
  \ attacker to know internal hostnames/IP addresses.\n\nThe previous versions have been marked\
  \ as deprecated on NPM.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 2.1.0 released alongside this security advisory\
  \ addresses the issue. **Please note that this release is not backwards compatible out of\
  \ the box. See the [changelog](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\
  \ for details.**\n\nAdditionally, it's also recommended to upgrade to the latest version of\
  \ Highcharts to get the added input sanitation implemented in version 9.0 and later. \n\n\
  ### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds to the issue - an upgrade to version 2.1.0\
  \ is required.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this\
  \ advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the export server issue tracker](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/issues)\n\
