summary: "Inventree Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability exposes server port/internal IP\n\
  ### Impact\n\nThe \"download image from remote URL\" feature can be abused by a malicious\
  \ actor to potentially extract information about server side resources. Submitting a crafted\
  \ URL (in place of a valid image) can raise a server side error, which is reported back to\
  \ the user. \n\nThis error message may contain sensitive information about the server side\
  \ request, including information about the availability of the remote resource.\n\n### Patches\n\
  \nThe solution to this vulnerability is to prevent the server from returning any specific\
  \ information about the observed exception. Instead, a generic error message is returned to\
  \ the client.\n\nThis patch has been applied to the upcoming 0.17.0 release, and also back-ported\
  \ to the 0.16.5 stable release.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo avoid this issue with unpatched versions,\
  \ the \"download image from remote URL\" feature can be disabled in InvenTree, preventing\
  \ users from accessing this information. \n\n### References\n\nThanks to @febin0x10 for identifying\
  \ this vulnerability and reporting it to us as per our security policy."
