summary: "Potential Actions command injection in output filenames (GHSL-2023-275)\n### Summary\n\
  The [`tj-actions/verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files)\
  \ action allows for command injection in changed filenames, allowing an attacker to execute\
  \ arbitrary code and potentially leak secrets.\n\n### Details\nThe [`verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files)\
  \ workflow returns the list of files changed within a workflow execution.\n\nThis could potentially\
  \ allow filenames that contain special characters such as `;` and \\` (backtick) which can\
  \ be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)\
  \ if the output value is used in a raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution)\
  \ inside a `run` block. By running custom commands an attacker may be able to steal **secrets**\
  \ such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than `pull_request`. For example on\
  \ `push`.\n\n#### Proof of Concept\n\n1. Submit a pull request to the repository with a new\
  \ file injecting a command. For example `$(whoami).txt` would be a valid filename.\n2. Upon\
  \ approval of the workflow (triggered by the pull request), the action will get executed and\
  \ the malicious pull request filename will flow into the `List all changed files tracked and\
  \ untracked files` step.\n\n```yaml\n- name: List all changed files tracked and untracked\
  \ files\n  run: |\n    echo \"Changed files: ${{ steps.verify-changed-files.outputs.changed_files\
  \ }}\"\n```\n\nExample output:\n\n```yaml\n##[group]Run echo \"Changed files: $(whoami).txt\"\
  \n  echo \"Changed files: $(whoami).txt\"\e[0m\nshell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}\n##[endgroup]\n\
  Changed files: runner.txt\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis issue may lead to arbitrary command execution\
  \ in the GitHub Runner.\n\n### Resolution\n- A new `safe_output` input would be enabled by\
  \ default and return filename paths escaping special characters like ;, ` (backtick), $, (),\
  \ etc for bash environments.\n\n- A safe recommendation of using environment variables to\
  \ store unsafe outputs.\n\n```yaml\n- name: List all changed files tracked and untracked files\n\
  \  env:\n     CHANGED_FILES: ${{ steps.verify-changed-files.outputs.changed_files }}\n  run:\
  \ |\n    echo \"Changed files: $CHANGED_FILES\"\n```\n\n\n### Resources\n\n* [Keeping your\
