aliases:
  - CVE-2024-52600
summary: |
  Statamic CMS has a Path Traversal in Asset Upload
  Assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured.

  ### Impact

  - Affects front-end forms with `assets` fields.
  - Affects other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway.
  - Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files.
  - Traversal _outside_ an asset container was not possible.

  ### Patches

  This has been fixed in 5.17.0.
