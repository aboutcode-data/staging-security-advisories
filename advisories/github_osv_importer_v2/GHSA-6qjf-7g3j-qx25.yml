summary: |
  Neos CMS Cross Site Scripting vulnerability
  Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Neos CMS 8.3.3 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SVG file uploaded to the `neos/management/media` component. To make use of this attack vector, the attacker must either be able to upload a maliciously crafted file or coerce someone with the needed access to upload said file to Neos. Even if such a file is uploaded and subsequently delivered, it is possible to use CSP to protect against attacks being executed from such a file.
