  - CVE-2022-23638
summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting in enshrined/svg-sanitize
  ### Impact
  SVG sanitizer library before version `0.15.0` did not remove HTML elements wrapped in a CDATA section. As a result, SVG content embedded in HTML (fetched as `text/html`) was susceptible to cross-site scripting. Plain SVG files (fetched as `image/svg+xml`) were not affected.

  ### Patches
  This issue is fixed in `0.15.0` and higher.

  ### Workarounds
  There is currently no workaround available without upgrading.
