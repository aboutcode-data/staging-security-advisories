  TYPO3 Arbitrary Code Execution and Cross-Site Scripting in Backend API
  Backend API configuration using Page TSconfig is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution and cross-site scripting. TSconfig fields of page properties in backend forms can be used to inject malicious sequences. Field tsconfig_includes is vulnerable to directory traversal leading to same scenarios as having direct access to TSconfig settings.

  A valid backend user account having access to modify values for fields `pages.TSconfig` and `pages.tsconfig_includes` is needed in order to exploit this vulnerability.
