summary: |
  Data races in hashconsing
  Affected versions of hashconsing implements Send/Sync for its HConsed type without restricting it to Sendable types and Syncable types. This allows non-Sync types such as Cell to be shared across threads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent programs.
