aliases:
  - CVE-2021-44528
summary: |
  actionpack Open Redirect in Host Authorization Middleware
  Specially crafted "X-Forwarded-Host" headers in combination with certain "allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.

  Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. For example, configuration files that look like this:

  ```
  config.hosts <<  '.EXAMPLE.com'
  ```

  When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted Host header can be used to redirect to a malicious website.

  This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-22881 and CVE-2021-22942.
