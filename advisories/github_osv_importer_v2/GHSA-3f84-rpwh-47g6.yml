aliases:
  - CVE-2024-49769
summary: |
  Waitress vulnerable to DoS leading to high CPU usage/resource exhaustion
  ### Impact

  When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call `getpeername()` waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function.

  A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required.

  ### Patches

  Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.

  ### Workarounds

  No work-around.
