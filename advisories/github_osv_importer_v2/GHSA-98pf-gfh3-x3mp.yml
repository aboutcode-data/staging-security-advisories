summary: "Read the Docs vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ allowed a malicious user to serve arbitrary HTML files from the main application domain\
  \ (readthedocs[.]org/readthedocs[.]com) by exploiting a vulnerability in the code that serves\
  \ downloadable content from a project. \n\nExploiting this would have required the attacker\
  \ to get a logged-in user to visit the malicious URL, which would have allowed the attacker\
  \ to take control of the user's session with JavaScript (making requests to the API/site on\
  \ behalf of the user). This URL would have looked something like `hxxps[:]//readthedocs[.]org/projects/attacker-project/downloads/html/version-with-javascript-attack/`.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in our 8.8.1 release."
