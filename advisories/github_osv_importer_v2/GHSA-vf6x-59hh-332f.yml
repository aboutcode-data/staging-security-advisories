summary: |
  Formwork has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Site title
  ### Summary

  The site title field at /panel/options/site/allows embedding JS tags, which can be used to attack all members of the system. This is a widespread attack and can cause significant damage if there is a considerable number of users.

  ### Impact

  The attack is widespread, leveraging what XSS can do. This will undoubtedly impact system availability.

  ### Patches
  - [**Formwork 2.x** (aa3e9c6)](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/aa3e9c684035d9e8495169fde7c57d97faa3f9a2) escapes site title from panel header navigation.

  ### Details

  By embedding "<!--", the source code can be rendered non-functional, significantly impacting system availability. However, the attacker would need admin privileges, making the attack more difficult to execute.
