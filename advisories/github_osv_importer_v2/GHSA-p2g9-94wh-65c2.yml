  Space bug in `clean_text`
  An incorrect mapping from HTML specification to ASCII codes was used.
  Because HTML treats the Form Feed as whitespace, code like this has an injection bug:

      let html = format!("<div title={}>", clean_text(user_supplied_string));

  Applications are not affected if they quote their attributes, or if they don't use `clean_text` at all.
