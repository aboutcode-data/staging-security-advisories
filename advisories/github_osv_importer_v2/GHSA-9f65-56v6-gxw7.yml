summary: "Claude Code Improper Authorization via websocket connections from arbitrary origins\n\
  Claude Code extensions in VSCode and forks (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium) and JetBrains\
  \ IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Pycharm, and Android Studio) are vulnerable to unauthorized websocket\
  \ connections from an attacker when visiting attacker-controlled webpages. Claude Code for\
  \ VSCode IDE extensions versions 0.2.116 through 1.0.23 are vulnerable. For Jetbrains IDE\
  \ plugins, Claude Code [beta] versions 0.1.1 through 0.1.8 are vulnerable.  \n\nIn VSCode\
  \ (and forks), exploitation would allow an attacker to read arbitrary files, see the list\
  \ of files open in the IDE, get selection and diagnostics events from the IDE, or execute\
  \ code in limited situations where a user has an open Jupyter Notebook and accepts a malicious\
  \ prompt. In JetBrains IDEs, an attacker could get selection events, a list of open files,\
  \ and a list of syntax errors.\n\n**Remediation**\n\nWe released a patch for this issue on\
  \ June 13th, 2025. Although Claude Code auto-updates when you launch it and auto-updates the\
  \ extensions, you should take the following steps (the exact steps depend on your IDE).\n\n\
  **VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VSCode forks**\nExtension Name: Claude Code\
  \ for VSCode\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Open the list of Extensions (View->Extensions)\n2. Look\
  \ for Claude Code for VSCode among installed extensions\n3. If you have a version < 1.0.24,\
  \ click “Update” (or “Uninstall”)\n4. Restart the IDE \n\n**All JetBrains IDEs including IntelliJ,\
  \ PyCharm, and Android Studio**\nPlugin name: Claude Code [Beta]\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Open\
  \ the Plugins list\n2. Look for Claude Code [Beta] among installed extensions\n3. Update (or\
  \ Uninstall) the plugin if the version is < 0.1.9\n4. Restart the IDE"
