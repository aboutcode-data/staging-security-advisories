  - CVE-2024-47871
summary: "Gradio uses insecure communication between the FRP client and server\n### Impact \
  \ \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability involves\
  \ **insecure communication** between the FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) client and server when Gradio's\
  \ `share=True` option is used. HTTPS is not enforced on the connection, allowing attackers\
  \ to intercept and read files uploaded to the Gradio server, as well as modify responses or\
  \ data sent between the client and server. This impacts users who are sharing Gradio demos\
  \ publicly over the internet using `share=True` without proper encryption, exposing sensitive\
  \ data to potential eavesdroppers.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=5` to\
  \ address this issue.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate\
  \ the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nAs a workaround, users can avoid using `share=True`\
  \ in production environments and instead host their Gradio applications on servers with HTTPS\
  \ enabled to ensure secure communication."
