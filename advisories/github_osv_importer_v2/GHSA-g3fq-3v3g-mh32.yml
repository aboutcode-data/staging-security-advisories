aliases:
  - CVE-2021-29438
summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in @nextcloud/dialogs
  ### Impact

  The Nextcloud dialogs library before 3.1.2 did insufficiently escape text input passed to a toast. If your application displays toasts with user-supplied input, this could lead to a XSS vulnerability.

  _Note_: Nextcloud Server employs a strict Content Security Policy that mitigates the risk of these XSS vulnerabilities.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1.2. If you need to display HTML in the toast, explicitly pass the `options.isHTML` config flag.

  ### Workarounds

  Make sure no user-supplied input flows into toasts.
