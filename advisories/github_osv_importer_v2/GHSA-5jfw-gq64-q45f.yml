  - CVE-2024-52595
summary: |
  HTML Cleaner allows crafted scripts in special contexts like svg or math to pass through
  ### Impact

  The HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content.

  ### Patches

  Users employing the HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0, which addresses this issue.

  ### Workarounds

  As a temporary mitigation, users can configure lxml_html_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability:
  * `remove_tags`: Specify tags to remove - their content is moved to their parents' tags.
  * `kill_tags`: Specify tags to be removed completely.
  * `allow_tags`: Restrict the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`.
