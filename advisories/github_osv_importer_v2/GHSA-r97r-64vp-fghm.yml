  Silverstripe XSS vulnerability via VirtualPage
  A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the VirtualPage class.

  This vulnerability can only be exploited if a user with CMS access has posted malicious or unescaped HTML into any of the textfields of a page which a VirtualPage refers to.

  This has been resolved by ensuring that VirtualPage safely escapes all field content.
