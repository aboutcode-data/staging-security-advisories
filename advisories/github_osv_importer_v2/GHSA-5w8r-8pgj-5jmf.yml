summary: "matrix-js-sdk subject to user impersonation due to key/device identifier confusion\
  \ in SAS verification\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could\
  \ interfere with the verification flow between two users, injecting its own cross-signing\
  \ user identity in place of one of the users’ identities, leading to the other device trusting/verifying\
  \ the user identity under the control of the homeserver instead of the intended one.\n\nThe\
  \ vulnerability is a bug in the matrix-js-sdk, caused by checking and signing user identities\
  \ and devices in two separate steps, and inadequately fixing the keys to be signed between\
  \ those steps.\n\nEven though the attack is partly made possible due to the design decision\
  \ of treating cross-signing user identities as Matrix devices on the server side (with their\
  \ device ID set to the public part of the user identity key), no other examined implementations\
  \ were vulnerable.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe matrix-js-sdk has been modified to double check that\
  \ the key signed is the one that was verified instead of just referencing the key by ID. An\
  \ additional check has been made to report an error when one of the device ID matches a cross-signing\
  \ key.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nAs this attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver\
  \ and an attacker -- if you trust your homeserver no particular workaround is needed. \n\n\
  As a potential way of detecting compromise, it’s possible to review your device list or the\
  \ device list of other users for devices with IDs in the form of a base64 cross-signing key\
  \ (`5XaczGNlfz0bl8R1IX5qn+tBoue2tWJqLMh+SDUuvCk`) instead of classical device ID (`SEHACYDHMG`).\n\
