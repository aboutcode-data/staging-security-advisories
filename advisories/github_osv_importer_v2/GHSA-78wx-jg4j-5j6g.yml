  - CVE-2024-1765
summary: |
  quiche vulnerable to unlimited resource allocation by QUIC CRYPTO frames flooding
  ### Impact

  Cloudflare Quiche (through version 0.19.1/0.20.0) was affected by an unlimited resource allocation vulnerability causing rapid increase of memory usage of the system running quiche server or client.

  A remote attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by repeatedly sending an unlimited number of 1-RTT CRYPTO frames after previously completing the QUIC handshake.
  Exploitation was possible for the duration of the connection which could be extended by the attacker.

  ### Patches

  Quiche 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest versions containing the fix for this issue.
