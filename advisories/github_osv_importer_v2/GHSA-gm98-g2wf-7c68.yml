summary: "amphp/artax Cookie leakage to wrong origins and non-restricted cookie acceptance\n\
  In artax version before 1.0.6 and 2 before 2.0.6, cookies of `foo.bar.example.com` were leaked\
  \ to `foo.bar`. Additionally, any site could set cookies for any other site. \nArtax fixed\
  \ this issue by following newer browser implementations now. Cookies can only be set on domains\
  \ higher or equal to the current domain, but not on any public suffixes."
