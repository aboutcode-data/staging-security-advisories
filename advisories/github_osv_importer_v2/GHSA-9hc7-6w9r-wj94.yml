  - CVE-2024-36400
summary: |
  Unable to generate the correct character set
  # Reduced entropy due to inadequate character set usage

  ## Description

  Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified.

  It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability.

  ## Impact

  This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers.

  ## Patches

  The flaws were corrected in commit [a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23](https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23) by updating the the `nano_id::gen` macro to use all specified characters correctly.

  ## PoC

  ```rust
  use std::collections::BTreeSet;

  fn main() {
      test_base58();
      test_base62();
  }

  fn test_base58() {
      let mut produced_symbols = BTreeSet::new();

      for _ in 0..100_000 {
          let id = nano_id::base58::<10>();
          for c in id.chars() {
              produced_symbols.insert(c);
          }
      }

      println!(
          "{} symbols generated from nano_id::base58",
          produced_symbols.len()
      );
  }

  fn test_base62() {
      let mut produced_symbols = BTreeSet::new();

      for _ in 0..100_000 {
          let id = nano_id::base62::<10>();
          for c in id.chars() {
              produced_symbols.insert(c);
          }
      }

      println!(
          "{} symbols generated from nano_id::base62",
          produced_symbols.len()
      );
  }
  ```
