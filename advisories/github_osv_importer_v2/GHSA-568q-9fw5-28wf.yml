aliases:
  - CVE-2018-10936
summary: |
  Moderate severity vulnerability that affects org.postgresql:pgjdbc-aggregate
  A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.
