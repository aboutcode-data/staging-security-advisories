summary: |
  TinyScientist has Path Traversal Vulnerability in PDF Review Function (CWE-22)
  ## Description
  A critical path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) has been identified in the `review_paper` function in `backend/app.py`. The vulnerability allows malicious users to access arbitrary PDF files on the server by providing crafted file paths that bypass the intended security restrictions.

  ## Impact
  This vulnerability allows attackers to:
  - Read any PDF file accessible to the server process
  - Potentially access sensitive documents outside the intended directory
  - Perform reconnaissance on the server's file system structure

  ## Vulnerable Code
  The issue occurs in the `review_paper` function around line 744:

  ```python
  if pdf_path.startswith("/api/files/"):
      # Safe path handling for API routes
      relative_path = pdf_path[len("/api/files/"):]
      generated_base = os.path.join(project_root, "generated")
      absolute_pdf_path = os.path.join(generated_base, relative_path)
  else:
      absolute_pdf_path = pdf_path  # VULNERABLE: Direct use of user input
  ```

  ## Proof of Concept
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/review \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"pdf_path": "/etc/passwd"}'
  ```

  ## Credit
  This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ruizhe.
