  - CVE-2022-36084
summary: |
  cruddl vulnerable to ArangoDB Query Language (AQL) injection through flexSearch
  ### Impact

  If a vunerable version of cruddl is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB.

  Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected.

  The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled.

  ### Patches

  The issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl.

  ### Workarounds

  Users can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas before they can update cruddl.
