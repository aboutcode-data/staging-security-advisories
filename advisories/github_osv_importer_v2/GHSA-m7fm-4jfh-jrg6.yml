summary: "Use after free in boosted trees creation\n### Impact\nThe implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble`\
  \ can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments:\n\
  \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nv= tf.Variable([0.0])\ntf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble(\n\
  \  tree_ensemble_handle=v.handle,\n  stamp_token=[0],\n  tree_ensemble_serialized=['0']) \n\
  ```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55)\
  \ uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails,\
  \ as it should. However, when the code was written, the  resource was represented as a naked\
  \ pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer\
  \ leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take\
  \ into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already\
  \ freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for\
  \ cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed.\n\n### Patches\nWe have\
  \ patched the issue in GitHub commit [5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab).\n\
  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow\
  \ 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported\
  \ range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and\
  \ questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul\
  \ Team from Qihoo 360."
