  Cross-Site Scripting in highcharts
  Versions of `highcharts` prior to 7.2.2 or 8.1.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  The package fails to sanitize `href` values and does not restrict URL schemes, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser if they click the link.
