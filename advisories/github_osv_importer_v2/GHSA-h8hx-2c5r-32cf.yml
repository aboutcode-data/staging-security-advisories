  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in trestle-auth
  ### Impact
  A vulnerability in trestle-auth versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 allows an attacker to create a form that will bypass Rails' built-in CSRF protection when submitted by a victim with a trestle-auth admin session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter protected data, including admin account credentials.

  ### Patches
