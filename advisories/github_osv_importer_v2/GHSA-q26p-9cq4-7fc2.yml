  - CVE-2025-24883
summary: |
  Go Ethereum vulnerable to DoS via malicious p2p message
  ### Impact

  A vulnerable node can be forced to shutdown/crash using a specially crafted message.

  During the peer-to-peer connection handshake, a shared secret key is computed. The implementation
  did not verify whether the EC public key provided by the remote party is a valid point on the secp256k1 curve.
  By simply sending an all-zero public key, a crash could be induced due to unexpected results from the handshake.

  The issue was fixed by adding a curve point validity check in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/159fb1a1db551c544978dc16a5568a4730b4abf3

  ### Patches

  A fix has been included in geth version 1.14.13 and onwards.

  ### Workarounds

  Unfortunately, no workaround is available.

  This issue was originally reported to Polygon Security by David Matosse (@iam-ned).
