summary: "Dash apps vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting\nVersions of the package dash-core-components\
  \ before 2.13.0; versions of the package dash-core-components before 2.0.0; versions of the\
  \ package dash before 2.15.0; versions of the package dash-html-components before 2.0.0; versions\
  \ of the package dash-html-components before 2.0.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting\
  \ (XSS) when the href of the a tag is controlled by an adversary. An authenticated attacker\
  \ who stores a view that exploits this vulnerability could steal the data that's visible to\
  \ another user who opens that view - not just the data already included on the page, but they\
  \ could also, in theory, make additional requests and access other data accessible to this\
  \ user. In some cases, they could also steal the access tokens of that user, which would allow\
  \ the attacker to act as that user, including viewing other apps and resources hosted on the\
  \ same server. \n\n**Note:** \n\nThis is only exploitable in Dash apps that include some mechanism\
  \ to store user input to be reloaded by a different user."
