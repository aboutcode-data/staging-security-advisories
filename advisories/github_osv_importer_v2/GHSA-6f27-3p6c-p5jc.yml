summary: "`cilium-cli` disables etcd authorization for clustermesh clusters\n### Impact\n\n\
  `cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality, can remove the enforcement\
  \ of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote\
  \ clusters. \n\nDue to an incorrect mount point specification, the settings specified by the\
  \ `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when\
  \ using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access\
  \ to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then\
  \ modify state in that `etcd` cluster.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is patched in `cilium-cli`\
  \ 0.13.2\n\nAll previous versions of `cilium-cli` are affected. Users who have set up cluster\
  \ meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse Cilium's\
  \ [Helm charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium) to create your cluster\
  \ instead.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members\
  \ of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Marco Iorio for investigating\
  \ and fixing the issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments\
  \ about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\
  \nAs usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to report\
  \ security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io)\
  \ - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing list where\
  \ only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to, and is treated as top\
  \ priority."
