  Potential Denial-of-Service condition leading to temporary disability in IBC transfers to the native chain
  ### Impact

  Chains using affected versions of Packet Forward Middleware in their IBC Transfer stack are vulnerable to an attack in which there is a potential denial of service. This affects IBC transfers for any asset which is being transferred between another chain and its native chain.

  We recommend upgrading as soon as possible.

  __THIS IS A STATE BREAKING CHANGE__


  ### Patches
  Versions [7.2.1](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/releases/tag/middleware%2Fpacket-forward-middleware%2Fv7.2.1) and [8.1.1](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/releases/tag/middleware%2Fpacket-forward-middleware%2Fv8.1.1) are patched.
