summary: "containerd CRI server: Host memory exhaustion through Attach goroutine leak\n### Impact\n\
  \nA bug was found in containerd's CRI Attach implementation where a user can exhaust memory\
  \ on the host due to goroutine leaks. \n\nRepetitive calls of CRI Attach (e.g., [`kubectl\
  \ attach`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_attach/)) could\
  \ increase the memory usage of containerd.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in the\
  \ following containerd versions:\n\n* 2.2.0\n* 2.1.5\n* 2.0.7\n* 1.7.29\n\nUsers should update\
  \ to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSet up an admission controller\
  \ to control accesses to `pods/attach` resources.\ne.g., [Validating Admission Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/).\n\
  \n### Credits\n\nThe containerd project would like to thank @Wheat2018 for responsibly disclosing\
  \ this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\
