aliases:
  - CVE-2025-64715
summary: |
  Cilium with misconfigured toGroups in policies can lead to unrestricted egress traffic
  ### Impact

  `CiliumNetworkPolicy`s which use `egress.toGroups.aws.securityGroupsIds` to reference AWS security group IDs that do not exist or are not attached to any network interface may unintentionally allow broader outbound access than intended by the policy authors. In such cases, the toCIDRset section of the derived policy is not generated, which means outbound traffic may be permitted to more destinations than originally intended.

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in:

  * Cilium v1.18.4
  * Cilium v1.17.10
  * Cilium v1.16.17

  ### This issue affects:

  - Cilium v1.18 between v1.18.0 and v1.18.3 inclusive
  - Cilium v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.9 inclusive
  - Cilium v1.16.16 and below

  ### Workarounds

  There is no workaround to this issue.

  ### Acknowledgements

  The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @SeanEmac   for reporting this issue and to @fristonio for the patch.
