  Cross-Site Scripting in dompurify
  Versions of `dompurify` prior to 2.0.7 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It is possible to bypass the package sanitization through Mutation XSS, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.0.7 or later.
