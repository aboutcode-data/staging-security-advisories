summary: "AzuraCast Vulnerable to Pre-Auth File Deletion & Admin RCE\nAn API endpoint that is\
  \ intended for internal use by the SFTP software `sftpgo` was mistakenly exposed to the public-facing\
  \ HTTP API for AzuraCast installations.\n\nThis would allow a user with specific internal\
  \ knowledge of a station's operations to craft a custom HTTP request that would affect the\
  \ contents of a station's database, without revealing any internal information about the station.\n\
  \nWith a request like:\n\n```\ncurl -s -X POST \"http://localhost/api/internal/sftp-event\"\
  \   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -d '{\n    \"action\": \"pre-delete\",\n    \"\
  username\": \"admin\",\n    \"path\": \"/var/azuracast/stations/test/media/test.mp3\"\n}'\n\
  ```\n\nA remote user could simulate a request from `sftpgo` informing the software that a\
  \ file was about to be deleted from the path given. In anticipation of this, AzuraCast would\
  \ delete the corresponding database record for that file. While AzuraCast would then later\
  \ discover on its own that the file actually exists and recreate the media record, it would\
  \ not have the same playlist associations or custom metadata as the previous instance of the\
  \ media record in the database.\n\nSome mitigating factors affecting the severity of this\
  \ issue include:\n - A user would need to know a valid SFTP username corresponding to the\
  \ specific station in question.\n - A user would need to know the internal filesystem structure\
  \ of a station (or be able to brute-force or guess paths).\n - Any call to this internal API\
  \ endpoint does not return any information to the calling process about what files are present\
  \ or aren't, so no confidential internal information is revealed by this process.\n \nPatched\
  \ versions of AzuraCast specifically check that any calls to this internal URL are being called\
  \ by the internal HTTP service, which only listens for activity on `localhost` and is not\
  \ accessible from outside the container."
