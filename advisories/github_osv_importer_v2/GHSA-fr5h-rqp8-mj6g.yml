summary: "Next.js Server-Side Request Forgery in Server Actions\n### Impact\nA Server-Side Request\
  \ Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions by security researchers\
  \ at Assetnote. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an\
  \ attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application\
  \ server itself.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n* Next.js (`<14.1.1`) is running in a self-hosted*\
  \ manner.\n* The Next.js application makes use of Server Actions.\n* The Server Action performs\
  \ a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`.\n\n\\* Many hosting providers (including\
  \ Vercel) route requests based on the Host header, so we do not believe that this vulnerability\
  \ affects any Next.js applications where routing is done in this manner.\n\n### Patches\n\
  This vulnerability was patched in [#62561](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/62561) and\
  \ fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.\n \n### Workarounds\nThere are no official workarounds for this\
  \ vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to Next.js `14.1.1`.\n\n### Credit\nVercel and the\
  \ Next.js team thank Assetnote for responsibly disclosing this issue to us, and for working\
  \ with us to verify the fix. Thanks to:\n\nAdam Kues - Assetnote\nShubham Shah - Assetnote"
