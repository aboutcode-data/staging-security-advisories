summary: |
  vyper default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys
  ### Summary
  Prior to v0.3.0, `__default__()` functions did not respect the `@nonreentrancy` decorator and the lock was not emitted. This is a known bug and was already visible in the issue tracker (https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2455), but it is being re-issued as an advisory so that tools relying on the advisory publication list can incorporate it into their searches.

  A contract search was additionally performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.

  ### PoC
  ```vyper
  @external
  @payable
  @nonreentrant("default")
  def __default__():
      pass
  ```

  after codegen:
  ```
  [seq,
    [if, [lt, calldatasize, 4], [goto, fallback]],
    [mstore, 28, [calldataload, 0]],
    [with, _func_sig, [mload, 0], seq],
    [seq_unchecked,
      [label, fallback],
      [seq,
        pass,
        # Line 5
        pass,
        pass,
        # Line 4
        stop]]],
  ```

  ### Impact
  No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, using a lock on a `default` function is a very sparsely used pattern. As such, the impact is `low`.
