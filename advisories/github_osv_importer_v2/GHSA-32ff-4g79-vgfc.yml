aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31177
summary: |
  Flask-AppBuilder before v4.1.3 allows inference of sensitive information through query strings
  ### Impact
  An authenticated Admin user could craft HTTP requests to filter users by their salted and hashed passwords strings. These filters could be made by using partial hashed password strings. The response would not include the hashed passwords, but an attacker could infer partial password hashes and their respective users.

  Only when using `AUTH_DB` database authentication option.

  ### Patches
  Fixed on 4.1.3
