aliases:
  - CVE-2023-25656
summary: |
  notation-go has excessive memory allocation on verification
  ### Impact

  `notation-go` users will find their application using excessive memory when verifying signatures and the application will be finally killed, and thus availability is impacted.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been patched in the release [v1.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3). Users should upgrade their `notation-go` packages to `v1.0.0-rc.3` or above.

  ### Workarounds

  Users can review their own trust policy file and check if the identity string contains `=#`. Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in their trust stores referenced by their own trust policy files, and make sure the `authenticity` validation is set to `enforce`

  ### Credits

  The `notation-go` project would like to thank Adam Korczynski (@AdamKorcz) for responsibly disclosing this issue during a security fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF and Shiwei Zhang (@shizhMSFT) for root cause analysis and detailed vulnerability report.
