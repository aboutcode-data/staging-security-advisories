aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41254
summary: |
  Missing permission checks in Jenkins CONS3RT Plugin allow capturing credentials
  CONS3RT Plugin 1.0.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
