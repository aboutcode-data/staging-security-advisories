  - CVE-2025-27144
summary: |
  DoS in go-jose Parsing
  ### Impact
  When parsing compact JWS or JWE input, go-jose could use excessive memory. The code used strings.Split(token, ".") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of '.' characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service.

  ### Patches
  Version 4.0.5 fixes this issue

  ### Workarounds
  Applications could pre-validate payloads passed to go-jose do not contain an excessive number of '.' characters.

  ### References
  This is the same sort of issue as in the golang.org/x/oauth2/jws package as CVE-2025-22868 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/71490.
