aliases:
  - CVE-2025-68457
summary: |
  Orejime has executable code in HTML attributes
  ### Impact

  On HTML elements handled by Orejime, one could run malicious code by embedding `javascript:` code within data attributes.
  When consenting to the related purpose, Orejime would turn data attributes into unprefixed ones (i.e. `data-href` into `href`), thus executing the code.

  This shouldn't have any impact on most setups, as elements handled by Orejime are generally hardcoded. The problem would only arise if somebody could inject HTML code within pages.

  See https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/issues/142 for the original report.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been patched by https://github.com/boscop-fr/orejime/pull/143. It is available in version 2.3.2.

  ### Workarounds

  The problem can be fixed outside of Orejime by sanitizing attributes which could contain executable code.
