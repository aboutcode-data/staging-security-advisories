  Duplicate Advisory: Moderate severity vulnerability that affects activemodel
  ## Duplicate advisory

  ## Original Description
  Active Model in Ruby on Rails 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 supports the use of instance-level writers for class accessors, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended validation steps via crafted parameters.
