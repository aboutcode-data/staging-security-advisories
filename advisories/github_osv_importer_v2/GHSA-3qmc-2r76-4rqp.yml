summary: "Redwood is vulnerable to account takeover via dbAuth \"forgot-password\"\n# Impact\n\
  \n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis is an API vulnerability in\
  \ Redwood's [dbAuth], specifically the dbAuth forgot password feature:\n- only projects with\
  \ the dbAuth \"forgot password\" feature are affected\n- this vulnerability was introduced\
  \ in v0.38.0\n\n## User Accounts are Vulnerable to Takeover (Hijacking)\n\nA reset token for\
  \ any user can be obtained given knowledge of their username or email via the forgot-password\
  \ API. With the leaked reset token, a malicious user could request to reset a user's password,\
  \ changing their credentials and gaining access to their account.\n\n## How to Determine if\
  \ Projects have been Attacked\n\nTo determine if a project has been attacked, we recommend\
  \ checking logs for suspicious activity; namely, the volume of requests to the forgot-password\
  \ API using emails that don't exist. Another indication is if users inform you that they can't\
  \ access their accounts.\n\nIf you have question or concerns, reach out via the \"For More\
  \ Information\" section below.\n\n# Patch Releases Available\n\n**The problem has been patched\
  \ on the v3 and v2 release lines.** Users should upgrade to **v3.3.1+**  or **v2.2.5+** respectively.\n\
  \n## Workarounds\n\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without\
  \ upgrading?_\n\nWe recommend upgrading to the Patch Releases above. If upgrading is not possible,\
  \ there are several workarounds:\n\n### Manually strip out `resetToken` and `resetTokenExpiresAt`\
  \ in the `forgotPassword.handler()`\n\nUsers on all release lines can have their `forgotPassword.handler()`\
  \ function strip out the sensitive fields manually before returning\n\n```js\nhandler: (user)\
  \ => {\n  // your code to notify/email user of the link to reset their password...\n\n  const\
  \ = { resetToken, resetTokenExpiresAt, ...rest }\n\n  return rest\n}\n```\n\n### Use `yarn\
  \ patch` to manually apply the fix\n\nUsers on v3 and v2 can use [`yarn patch`] to apply the\
  \ fix if they're using yarn v3. See the dbAuth \"forgot-password\" Account Takeover Vulnerability\
  \ high gist for instructions. \n\n### Disable the forgot password flow entirely v3 only\n\n\
  Users on v3 can disable the forgot password flow entirely."
