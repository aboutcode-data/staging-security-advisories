summary: "JSPUI Possible Cross Site Scripting in \"Request a Copy\" Feature\n### Impact\nThe\
  \ JSPUI \"Request a Copy\" feature does not properly escape values submitted and stored from\
  \ the \"Request a Copy\" form.  This means that item requests could be vulnerable to XSS attacks.\
  \  This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI.\n\n_This vulnerability does NOT impact the XMLUI\
  \ or 7.x._\n\n### Patches\n\n_DSpace 6.x:_ \n* Fixed in 6.4 via commit: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/503a6af57fd720c37b0d86c34de63baa5dd85819\n\
  * 6.x patch file: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/503a6af57fd720c37b0d86c34de63baa5dd85819.patch\
  \ (may be applied manually if an immediate upgrade to 6.4 is not possible)\n\n_DSpace 5.x:_\n\
  * Fixed in 5.11 via commit: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/28eb8158210d41168a62ed5f9e044f754513bc37\n\
  * 5.x patch file: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/28eb8158210d41168a62ed5f9e044f754513bc37.patch\
  \ (may be applied manually if an immediate upgrade to 5.11 or 6.4 is not possible)\n\n####\
  \ Apply the patch to your DSpace\nIf at all possible, we recommend upgrading your DSpace site\
  \ based on the upgrade instructions. However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually\
  \ apply the above patches as follows:\n1. Download the appropriate patch file to the machine\
  \ where DSpace is running\n2. From the `[dspace-src]` folder, apply the patch, e.g. `git apply\
  \ [name-of-file].patch`\n3. Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions).\
  \ This generally involves three steps:\n    1. Rebuild DSpace, e.g. `mvn -U clean package`\
  \  (This will recompile all DSpace code)\n    2. Redeploy DSpace, e.g. `ant update`  (This\
  \ will copy all updated WARs / configs to your installation directory). Depending on your\
  \ setup you also may need to copy the updated WARs over to your Tomcat webapps folder.\n \
  \   3. Restart Tomcat\n\n### Workarounds\nAs a workaround, you can temporarily disable the\
  \ \"Request a Copy\" feature by either commenting out the below configuration (or setting\
  \ its value to empty):\n```\n# Comment out this default value\n# request.item.type = all\n\
  ```\nOnce your JSPUI site is patched, you can re-enable this setting. See https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC6x/Request+a+Copy\
  \ for more information on this setting.\n\n### References\nDiscovered & reported by Andrea\
  \ Bollini of 4Science\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about\
  \ this advisory:\n* Email us at security@dspace.org"
