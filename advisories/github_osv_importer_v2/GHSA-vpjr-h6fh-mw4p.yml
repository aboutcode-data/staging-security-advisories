summary: "Duplicate Advisory: EVE Freely Allocates Buffer on The Stack With Data From Socket\n\
  ### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-phcg-h58r-gmcq.\
  \ This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n### Original Description\nAs\
  \ noted in the “VTPM.md” file in the eve documentation, “VTPM is a server listening on port\n\
  8877 in EVE, exposing limited functionality of the TPM to the clients. \nVTPM allows clients\
  \ to\nexecute tpm2-tools binaries from a list of hardcoded options”\nThe communication with\
  \ this server is done using protobuf, and the data is comprised of 2\nparts:\n\n1. Header\n\
  \n2. Data\n\nWhen a connection is made, the server is waiting for 4 bytes of data, which will\
  \ be the header,\nand these 4 bytes would be parsed as uint32 size of the actual data to come.\n\
  \nThen, in the function “handleRequest” this size is then used in order to allocate a payload\
  \ on\nthe stack for the incoming data.\n\nAs this payload is allocated on the stack, this\
  \ will allow overflowing the stack size allocated for\nthe relevant process with freely controlled\
  \ data.\n\n* An attacker can crash the system. \n* An attacker can gain control over the system,\
  \ specifically on the “vtpm_server” process\nwhich has very high privileges."
