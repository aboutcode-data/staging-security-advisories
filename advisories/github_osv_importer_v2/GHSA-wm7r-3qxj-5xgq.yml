summary: "Duplicate Advisory: Grafana Improper Access Control vulnerability\n## Duplicate Advisory\n\
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-cvm3-pp2j-chr3. This link\
  \ is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nGrafana is an\
  \ open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nThe option to send a test alert\
  \ is not available from the user panel UI for users having the Viewer role. It is still possible\
  \ for a user with the Viewer role to send a test alert using the API as the API does not check\
  \ access to this function.\n\nThis might enable malicious users to abuse the functionality\
  \ by sending multiple alert messages to e-mail and Slack, spamming users, prepare Phishing\
  \ attack or block SMTP server.\n\nUsers may upgrade to version 9.5.3, 9.4.12, 9.3.15, 9.2.19\
  \ and 8.5.26 to receive a fix."
