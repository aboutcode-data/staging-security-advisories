summary: "Keylime: unhandled exceptions could lead to invalid attestation states\n### Impact\n\
  \nThis vulnerability creates a false sense of security for keylime users -- i.e. a user could\
  \ query keylime and conclude that a parcitular node/agent is correctly attested, while attestations\
  \ are not in fact taking place.\n\n**Short explanation**: the keylime verifier creates periodic\
  \ reports on the state of each attested agent. The keylime verifier runs a set of python asynchronous\
  \ processes to challenge attested nodes and create reports on the outcome. \n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ consists of the above named python asynchronous processes failing silently, i.e. quitting\
  \ without leaving behind a database entry, raising an error or producing even a mention of\
  \ an error in a log. The silent failure can be triggered by a small set of transient network\
  \ failure conditions; recoverable device driver crashes being one such condition we saw in\
  \ the wild.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem is fixed in keylime starting with tag 6.5.1\n\n\
  ### Workarounds\n\nThis [patch](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/pull/1128/files) can be\
  \ retroactively applied to any running keylime deployment.\nOnly running verifiers need to\
  \ be patched.\nAfter the patch is applied, the keylime verifier needs to be restarted.\n\n\
  ### References\n\nThe problem, as well as the proposed fix, are described in detail [here](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/pull/1128).\n\
  Further details about the system where the bug was found, and the conditions in which the\
  \ bug was found, are available from @galmasi on demand.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf\
  \ you have any questions or comments about this [advisory](https://github.com/keylime/keylime/security/advisories/GHSA-hff2-x2j9-gxgv),\
  \ please comment at the bottom of the advisory itself."
