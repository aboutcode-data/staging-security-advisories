  - CVE-2025-23028
summary: |
  DoS in Cilium agent DNS proxy from crafted DNS responses
  ### Impact

  In a Kubernetes cluster where Cilium is configured to proxy DNS traffic, an attacker can crash Cilium agents by sending a crafted DNS response to workloads from outside the cluster.

  For traffic that is allowed but without using DNS-based policy, the dataplane will continue to pass traffic as configured at the time of the DoS. For workloads that have DNS-based policy configured, existing connections may continue to operate, and new connections made without relying on DNS resolution may continue to be established, but new connections which rely on DNS resolution may be disrupted. Any configuration changes that affect the impacted agent may not be applied until the agent is able to  restart.

  ### Patches

  This issue affects:

  - Cilium v1.14 between v1.14.0 and v1.14.17 inclusive
  - Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.11 inclusive
  - Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.4 inclusive

  This issue is fixed in:

  - Cilium v1.14.18
  - Cilium v1.15.12
  - Cilium v1.16.5

  ### Workarounds

  There are no known workarounds to this issue.

  ### Acknowledgements
