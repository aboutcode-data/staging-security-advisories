summary: |
  OpenClaw allows unauthenticated discovery TXT records to steer routing and TLS pinning
  ## Summary

  Discovery beacons (Bonjour/mDNS and DNS-SD) include TXT records such as `lanHost`, `tailnetDns`, `gatewayPort`, and `gatewayTlsSha256`. TXT records are unauthenticated.

  Prior to the fix, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative routing/pinning inputs:

  - iOS and macOS: used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`) and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL.
  - iOS and Android: allowed the discovery-provided TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously stored TLS pin.

  On a shared/untrusted LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially exfiltrating Gateway credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection.

  ## Distribution / Exposure

  The iOS and Android apps are currently alpha/not broadly shipped (no public App Store / Play Store release). Practical impact is primarily limited to developers/testers running those builds, plus any other shipped clients relying on discovery on a shared/untrusted LAN.

  CVSS can still be used for the technical (base) severity of the bug; limited distribution primarily affects environmental risk.

  ## Affected Packages / Versions

  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Affected: `<= 2026.2.13` (latest published on npm as of 2026-02-14)
  - Patched: planned for `>= 2026.2.14` (not yet published at time of writing)

  ## Fix

  - Clients now prefer the resolved service endpoint (SRV + A/AAAA) over TXT-provided routing hints.
  - Discovery-provided fingerprints no longer override stored TLS pins.
  - iOS/Android: first-time TLS pins require explicit user confirmation (fingerprint shown; no silent TOFU).
  - iOS/Android: discovery-based direct connects are TLS-only.
  - Android: hostname verification is no longer globally disabled (only bypassed when pinning).
