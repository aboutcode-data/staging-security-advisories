  - CVE-2022-23594
summary: "Out of bounds read in Tensorflow\n### Impact\nThe [TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/core/ir/importexport)\
  \ makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based\
  \ dialect.\n\nIf an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these assumptions\
  \ and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the\
  \ Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible.\n    \n\
  These issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist.\
  \ We will patch them as they are discovered.\n        \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue\
  \ in multiple GitHub commits and these will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0 and TensorFlow\
  \ 2.7.1, as both are affected.\n      \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security\
  \ guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information\
  \ regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions."
