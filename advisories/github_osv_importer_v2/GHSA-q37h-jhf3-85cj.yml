summary: "Bypass of CMS Safe Mode Security Feature\n### Impact\n\nAuthenticated users with permissions\
  \ to create or modify theme template objects through the backend \"CMS\" editor can exploit\
  \ this vulnerability to bypass the `cms.enableSafeMode` security feature if enabled (disables\
  \ modification of PHP code through the web interface when enabled).\n\nThis is only an issue\
  \ for Winter CMS instances that rely on the Safe Mode security feature to prevent privileged\
  \ users from modifying the PHP code of CMS theme template objects through the web interface.\n\
  \nCVSS v3.1 Vector: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)\n\
