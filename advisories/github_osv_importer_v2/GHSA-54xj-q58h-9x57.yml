summary: |
  Arbitrary File Write in iobroker.admin
  Versions of `iobroker.admin` prior to 3.6.12 are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended folder in the `/log/` route, which may allow attackers to include arbitrary files in the system. An attacker would need to be authenticated to perform the attack but the package has authentication disabled by default.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 3.6.12 or later.
