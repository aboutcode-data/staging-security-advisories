summary: "parse-server new anonymous user session acts as if it's created with password\n###\
  \ Impact\n\nDevelopers that use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login\
  \ anonymously. When an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session\
  \ incorrectly, particularly the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith`\
  \ shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith`\
  \ field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user,\
  \ the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`.\n\
  \nThe server currently doesn't use `createdWith` to make decisions on how things work internally,\
  \ so if a developer isn't using `createdWith` directly, there's nothing to worry about. The\
  \ vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly.   \n\n\
  ### Patches\nUpgrade to version 4.5.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use the `createdWith` Session\
  \ field to make decisions if you allow anonymous login.\n\n### References\nn/a"
