summary: |
  Incorrect default cookie name and recommendation
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  The default cookie name (and documentation recommendation) was prefixed with `Host__` instead of `__Host-`. The point of this prefix is for additional security, to ensure that, when no domain option is provided in the cookie options, we can guarantee the cookie came from the correct domain.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Yes, the problem is patched from version 2.2.1, this will not be back ported, but you can use the workaround described below.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  You can work around this by providing a custom `cookieName` as part of the options, which is correctly prefixed with `__Host-`.

  ### References
  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_
