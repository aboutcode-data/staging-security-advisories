summary: |
  Cached redirect poisoning via X-Forwarded-Host header
  A user supplied `X-Forwarded-Host` header can be used to perform cache poisoning of a cache fronting a Ratpack server if the cache key does not include the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as a cache key.

  Users are only vulnerable if they do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance. A custom `PublicAddress` can be specified by using [ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress](https://ratpack.io/manual/current/api/ratpack/server/ServerConfigBuilder.html#publicAddress-java.net.URI-). For versions prior to 1.9.0, by default, Ratpack utilizes an inferring version of `PublicAddress` which is vulnerable.

  ### Impact

  This can be used to perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker can force a cached redirect to redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location.

  ### Patches

  As of Ratpack 1.9.0, two changes have been made that mitigate this vulnerability:

  1. The default PublicAddress implementation no longer infers the address from the request context, instead relying on the configured bind host/port
  2. Relative redirects issued by the application are no longer absolutized; they are passed through as-is

  ### Workarounds

  In production, ensure that [ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress](https://ratpack.io/manual/current/api/ratpack/server/ServerConfigBuilder.html#publicAddress-java.net.URI-) correctly configures the server.
