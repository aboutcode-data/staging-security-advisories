summary: |
  Incorrect Authorization in Jenkins requests-plugin
  An incorrect permission check in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.16 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of pending requests. requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.17 requires Overall/Administer permission to view the list of pending requests.

  This is basically the same vulnerability as [SECURITY-1995](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-06-30/#SECURITY-1995), whose fix was ineffective.

  requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.17 requires Overall/Administer permission to view the list of pending requests.
