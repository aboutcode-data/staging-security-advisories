  - CVE-2026-25574
summary: |
  payload-preferences has Cross-Collection IDOR in Access Control (Multi-Auth Environments)
  ### Impact

  A cross-collection Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `payload-preferences` internal collection. In multi-auth collection environments using Postgres or SQLite with default serial/auto-increment IDs, authenticated users from one auth collection can read and delete preferences belonging to users in different auth collections when their numeric IDs collide.

  **Users are affected if ALL of these are true:**

  - Multiple auth collections configured (e.g., `admins` + `customers`)
  - Postgres or SQLite database adapter with serial/auto-increment IDs
  - Users in different auth collections with the same numeric ID

  **Not affected:**

  - `@payloadcms/db-mongodb` adapter
  - Single auth collection environments
  - Postgres/SQLite with `idType: 'uuid'`

  ### Patches

  This vulnerability has been patched in **v3.74.0**. Users should upgrade to v3.74.0 or later.

  ### Workarounds

  There is no workaround other than upgrading. Users with multiple auth collections using Postgres or SQLite with serial IDs should upgrade immediately.
