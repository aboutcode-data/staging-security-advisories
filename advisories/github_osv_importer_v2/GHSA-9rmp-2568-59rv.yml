summary: "rPGP Panics on Malformed Untrusted Input\nDuring a security audit, [Radically Open\
  \ Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) discovered several reachable edge cases\
  \ which allow an attacker to trigger `rpgp` crashes by providing crafted data.\n\n### Impact\n\
  When processing malformed input, `rpgp` can run into Rust panics which halt the program.\n\
  \nThis can happen in the following scenarios:\n* Parsing OpenPGP messages from binary or armor\
  \ format\n* Decrypting OpenPGP messages via `decrypt_with_password()`\n* Parsing or converting\
  \ public keys\n* Parsing signed cleartext messages from armor format\n* Using malformed private\
  \ keys to sign or encrypt\n\nGiven the affected components, we consider most attack vectors\
  \ to be reachable by remote attackers during typical use cases of the `rpgp` library. The\
  \ attack complexity is low since the malformed messages are generic, short, and require no\
  \ victim-specific knowledge.\n\nThe result is a denial-of-service impact via program termination.\
  \ There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.\n\n### Versions\
  \ and Patches\nAll recent versions are affected by at least some of the above mentioned issues.\
  \ \n\nThe vulnerabilities have been fixed with version `0.14.1`. We recommend all users to\
  \ upgrade to this version.\n\n### References\n\n\nThe security audit was made possible by\
  \ the [NLnet Foundation NGI Zero Core](https://nlnet.nl/core/) grant program [for rpgp](https://nlnet.nl/project/rPGP-cryptorefresh/)."
