summary: |
  hyper-staticfile's improper validation of Windows paths could lead to directory traversal attack
  Path resolution in `hyper-staticfile` didn't correctly validate Windows paths, meaning paths like `/foo/bar/c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png` would be allowed and respond with the contents of `c:/windows/web/screen/img101.png`. Thus users could potentially read files anywhere on the filesystem.

  This only impacts Windows. Linux and other unix likes are not impacted by this.
