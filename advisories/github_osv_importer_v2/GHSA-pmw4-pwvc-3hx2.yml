  - CVE-2025-54794
summary: "Claude Code Research Preview has a Path Restriction Bypass which could allow unauthorized\
  \ file access\nDue to a path validation flaw using prefix matching instead of canonical path\
  \ comparison, it was possible to bypass directory restrictions and access files outside the\
  \ CWD. Successful exploitation depends on the presence of (or ability to create) a directory\
  \ with the same prefix as the CWD and the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code\
  \ context window. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically\
  \ after release. Current users of Claude Code are unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24\
  \ are deprecated and have been forced to update.\n\nThank you to Elad Beber (Cymulate) for\
  \ reporting this issue!"
