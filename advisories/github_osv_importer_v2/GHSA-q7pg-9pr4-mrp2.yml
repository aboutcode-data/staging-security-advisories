summary: |
  httpsig-rs: HMAC verification is vulnerable to timing attack
  ### Summary
  HMAC signature comparison is not timing-safe and is vulnerable to timing attacks.

  ### Details
  `SharedKey::sign()` returns a `Vec<u8>` which has a non-constant-time equality implementation.

  `Hmac::finalize()` returns a constant-time wrapper ([`CtOutput`](https://docs.rs/digest/0.10.7/digest/struct.CtOutput.html)) which was discarded. Alternatively, `Hmac` has a constant-time `verify()` method.

  The problem reported here is due to the following lines in `SharedKey::sign()` of the previous code:
  ```rust
  let mut mac = HmacSha256::new_from_slice(key).unwrap();
  mac.update(data);
  Ok(mac.finalize().into_bytes().to_vec())
  ```
  and the merged update changes the third line to directly verify with `verify_slice`.

  ### Impact

  Anyone who uses HS256 signature verification is vulnerably to Timing Attack that allows the attacker to forge a signature.
