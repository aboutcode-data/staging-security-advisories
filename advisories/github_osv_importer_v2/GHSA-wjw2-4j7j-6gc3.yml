  - CVE-2023-37269
summary: "Winter CMS stored XSS through privileged upload of SVG file\n### Impact\nUsers with\
  \ the `backend.manage_branding` permission can upload SVGs as the application logo. Previously,\
  \ SVG uploads were not sanitized, which could have allowed a stored XSS attack. \n\nAlthough\
  \ this was a security issue, it's important to note that its severity is low. To exploit the\
  \ vulnerability, an attacker would already need to have developer or super user level permissions\
  \ in Winter CMS. This means they would already have extensive access and control within the\
  \ system. Additionally, to execute the XSS, the attacker would need to convince the victim\
  \ to directly visit the URL of the maliciously uploaded SVG, and the application would have\
  \ to be using local storage where uploaded files are served under the same domain as the application\
  \ itself instead of a CDN. This is because all SVGs in Winter CMS are rendered through an\
  \ `img` tag, which prevents any payloads from being executed directly.\n\nThese two factors\
  \ significantly limit the potential harm of this vulnerability. That being said, all users\
  \ are advised to update to the latest version (1.2.3) to ensure their systems remain secure.\n\
  \n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in v1.2.3 through the inclusion of full support\
  \ for SVG uploads and automatic sanitization of uploaded SVG files.\n\n### Workarounds\nApply\
  \ https://github.com/wintercms/storm/commit/186d85d8fea2cae43afc807d39f68553c24e56be & https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/fa50b4c7489b67ea80072f8ac9fe5294fce1df1c\
  \ manually if unable to upgrade to v1.2.3."
