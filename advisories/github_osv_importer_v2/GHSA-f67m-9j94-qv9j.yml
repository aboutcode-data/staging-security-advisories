summary: "Parser creates invalid uninitialized value\nAffected versions of this crate called\
  \ `mem::uninitialized()` in the HTTP1 parser to create values of type `httparse::Header` (from\
  \ the `httparse` crate).\nThis is unsound, since `Header` contains references and thus must\
  \ be non-null.\n \nThe flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`, using\
  \ `MaybeUninit` instead."
