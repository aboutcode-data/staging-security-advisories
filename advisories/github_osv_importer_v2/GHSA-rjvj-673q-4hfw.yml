  Command Injection in traceroute
  All versions of `traceroute` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `trace` function is vulnerable and can be abused if the `host` value is controlled by an attacker.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
