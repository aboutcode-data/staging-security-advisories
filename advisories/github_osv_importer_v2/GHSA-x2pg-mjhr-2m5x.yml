aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31051
summary: |
  Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in semantic-release
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Secrets that would normally be masked by semantic-release can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that are excluded from uri encoding by [encodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI). Occurrence is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the related repository is not available without modifying the repository url to inject credentials.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Fixed in 19.0.3

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  Secrets that do not contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL are already masked properly.
