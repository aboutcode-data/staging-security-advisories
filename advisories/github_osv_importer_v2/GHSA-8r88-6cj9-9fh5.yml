summary: |
  auth-js Vulnerable to Insecure Path Routing from Malformed User Input
  ### Impact
  The library functions `getUserById`, `deleteUser`, `updateUserById`, `listFactors` and `deleteFactor` did not require the user supplied values to be valid UUIDs. This could lead to a URL path traversal, resulting in the wrong API function being called.

  Implementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the `userId` are not affected by this.

  ### Patches
  Strict value checks have been added to all affected functions. These functions now require that the `userId` and `factorId` parameters MUST be valid UUID (v4).

  **Patched version:** >= 2.69.1

  ### Workarounds
  Implementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the `userId` are not affected by this. It is recommended that users of the auth-js library always follow security best practice and validate all inputs, before passing these to other functions or libraries.
