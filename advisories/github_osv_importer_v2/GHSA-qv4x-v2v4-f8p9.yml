  Withdrawn Advisory: Kirby CMS HTML injection vulnerability
  ## Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because the vendor reports that some HTML formatting (such as with an H1 element) is allowed, but there is backend sanitization such that the reporter's mentioned "injecting malicious scripts" would not occur.

  ## Original Advisory
  An HTML injection vulnerability in the Edit Content Layout module of Kirby CMS v4.1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload.
