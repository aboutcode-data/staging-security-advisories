summary: "Leantime allows Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**CSRF**\n### Summary\nA cross-site\
  \ request forgery vulnerability allows a remote actor to create an account with Owner privileges.\
  \ By luring an Owner or Administrator into clicking a button on an attacker-controlled website,\
  \ a request will be issued, generating an account with the attacker's information and role\
  \ of their choosing. \n\n### Impact\nWhile the likelihood of a successful exploit is low,\
  \ the impact would be high as the attacker could then gain complete control over the victim's\
  \ environment."
