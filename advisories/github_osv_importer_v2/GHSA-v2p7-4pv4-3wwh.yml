  - CVE-2025-59036
summary: |
  Infrahub: Deleted and expired API tokens can still authenticate
  ### Impact
  A bug in the authentication logic will cause API tokens that were deleted and/or expired to be considered valid. This means that any API token that is associated with an active user account can authenticate successfully.

  ### Patches
  This issue is fixed in versions `1.3.9` and `1.4.5`

  ### Workarounds
  Users can delete or deactivate the account associated with a deleted API token to prevent that token from authenticating.
