summary: |
  Strapi Allows Unauthorized Access to Private Fields via parms.lookup
  ### Summary
  It's possible to access any private fields by filtering through the lookup parameters

  ### Details

  Using the new lookup operator provided by the document service in Strapi 5, it is not properly sanitizing this query operator for private fields.

  ### PoC

  1. Create a strapi app.
  2. Create a content-type
  3. In the content-type you make a new entry
  4. Go back to the list view
  4. Add `&lookup[updatedBy][password][$startsWith]=$2` to the end of your url (All passwords start with $2) see that all entries are still there
  6. Add `&lookup[updatedBy][password][$startsWith]=$3` see the entry disappear proving that the search above works

  ### Impact

  An attacker can perform filtering attacks on everything related to the object, including admin passwords and reset-tokens. This means that they can gain full access to the strapi instance.
