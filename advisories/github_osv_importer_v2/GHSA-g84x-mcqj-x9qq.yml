aliases:
  - CVE-2025-69229
summary: |
  AIOHTTP vulnerable to DoS through chunked messages
  ### Summary

  Handling of chunked messages can result in excessive blocking CPU usage when receiving a large number of chunks.

  ### Impact

  If an application makes use of the `request.read()` method in an endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a moderate amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the request. This could potentially lead to DoS as the server would be unable to handle other requests during that time.
