  - CVE-2016-10592
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in jser-stat\nAffected versions of `jser-stat` insecurely\
  \ downloads resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network\
  \ position, they can modify or read such resources at will. While the exact severity of impact\
  \ for a vulnerability like this is highly variable and depends on the behavior of the package\
  \ itself, it ranges from being able to read sensitive information all the way up to and including\
  \ remote code execution.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this\
  \ vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a\
  \ different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced\
  \ by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the\
  \ package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability\
  \ are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your\
  \ ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
