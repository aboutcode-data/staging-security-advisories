  OpenFGA Authorization Bypass
  ### Overview
  During our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions v0.3.0 is vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.

  ### Am I Affected?
  You are affected by this vulnerability if **all** of the following applies:

  1.  You are using OpenFGA v0.3.0
  2. You created a model using modeling language v1.1 that applies a type restriction to an object e.g. `define viewer: [user]`
  3. You created tuples based on the aforementioned model, e.g. `document:1#viewer@user:jon`
  4. You updated the previous model by adding a new type and replacing the previous restriction with the newly added type e.g. `define viewer: [employee]`
  5. You use the tuples created against the first model (step 3) and issue checks against the updated model e.g. `user=user:jon, relation=viewer, object:document:1`

  ### How to fix that?
  Upgrade to version v0.3.1

  ### Backward Compatibility
  This update is backward compatible.
