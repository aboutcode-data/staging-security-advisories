  - CVE-2025-23047
summary: |
  Cilium has an information leakage via insecure default Hubble UI CORS header
  ### Impact

  For users who deploy Hubble UI using either Cilium CLI or via the Cilium Helm chart, an insecure default `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header value could lead to sensitive data exposure. A user with access to a Hubble UI instance affected by this issue could leak configuration details about the Kubernetes cluster which Hubble UI is monitoring, including node names, IP addresses, and other metadata about workloads and the cluster networking configuration. In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, a victim would have to first visit a malicious page.

  ### Patches

  This issue was patched in https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/a3489f190ba6e87b5336ee685fb6c80b1270d06d

  This issue affects:

  - Cilium between v1.14.0 and v1.14.18 inclusive
  - Cilium between v1.15.0 and v1.15.12 inclusive
  - Cilium between v1.16.0 and v1.16.5 inclusive

  This issue is patched in:

  - Cilium v1.14.19
  - Cilium v1.15.13
  - Cilium v1.16.6

  ### Workarounds

  Users who deploy Hubble UI using the Cilium Helm chart directly can remove the CORS headers from the Helm template as shown in the [patch](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/a3489f190ba6e87b5336ee685fb6c80b1270d06d).

  ### Acknowledgements
