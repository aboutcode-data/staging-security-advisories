  - CVE-2025-61686
summary: "React Router has Path Traversal in File Session Storage\nIf applications use `createFileSessionStorage()`\
  \ from `@react-router/node` (or `@remix-run/node`/`@remix-run/deno` in Remix v2) with an [**unsigned\
  \ cookie**](https://reactrouter.com/explanation/sessions-and-cookies#signing-cookies), it\
  \ is possible for an attacker to cause the session to try to read/write from a location outside\
  \ the specified session file directory. The success of the attack would depend on the permissions\
  \ of the web server process to access those files. \n\nRead files cannot be returned directly\
  \ to the attacker.  Session file reads would only succeed if the file matched the expected\
  \ session file format. If the file matched the session file format, the data would be populated\
  \ into the server side session but not directly returned to the attacker unless the application\
  \ logic returned specific session information."
