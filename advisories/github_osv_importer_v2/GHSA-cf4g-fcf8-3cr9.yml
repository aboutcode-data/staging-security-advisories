  `pnet_packet` buffer overrun in `set_payload` setters
  As indicated by this [issue](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet/issues/449#issuecomment-663355987), a buffer overrun is possible in the `set_payload` setter of the various mutable "Packet" struct setters. The offending `set_payload` functions were defined within the struct `impl` blocks in earlier versions of the package, and later by the `packet` macro.

  Fixed in the `packet` macro by [this](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet/pull/455) PR.
