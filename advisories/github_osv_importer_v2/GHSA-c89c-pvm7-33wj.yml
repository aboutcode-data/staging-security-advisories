summary: |
  Lack of SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin
  Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

  Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

  Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 by default no longer accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and performs hostname validation. A new configuration option allows restoring the previous, unsafe behavior. For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-windows-amis).
