summary: |
  vyper performs incorrect topic logging in raw_log
  ### Summary
  Incorrect values can be logged when `raw_log` builtin is called with memory or storage arguments to be used as topics.

  A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. In particular, no uses of `raw_log()` were found at all in production; it is apparently not a well-known function.

  ### Details
  The `build_IR` function of the `RawLog` class fails to properly unwrap the variables provided as topics. Consequently, incorrect values are logged as topics.

  ### PoC
  ```vyper
  x: bytes32

  @external
  def f():
      self.x = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
      raw_log([self.x], b"") # LOG1(offset:0x60, size:0x00, topic1:0x00)

      y: bytes32 = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
      raw_log([y], b"") # LOG1(offset:0x80, size:0x00, topic1:0x40)
  ```
  ### Patches
  Fixed in https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3977.

  ### Impact
  Incorrect values can be logged which may result in unexpected behavior in client-side applications relying on these logs.
