summary: |
  TorchServe vulnerable to bypass of allowed_urls configuration
  ### Impact
  TorchServe's check on allowed_urls configuration can be by-passed if the URL contains characters such as ".." but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded into the model store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing a URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls security check. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected.

  ### Patches
  This issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the URL without characters such as ".." before downloading: [#3082](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3082).

  TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability.
