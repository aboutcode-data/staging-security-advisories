  - CVE-2025-59288
summary: |
  Playwright downloads and installs browsers without verifying the authenticity of the SSL certificate
  ### Summary
  Use of `curl` with the `-k` (or `--insecure`) flag in installer scripts allows attackers to deliver arbitrary executables via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This can lead to full system compromise, as the downloaded files are installed as privileged applications.

  ### Details
  The following scripts in the `microsoft/playwright` repository at commit [`bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8) use `curl -k` to fetch and install executable packages without verifying the authenticity of the SSL certificate:


  - [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_beta_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_beta_mac.sh)
  - [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_stable_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_stable_mac.sh)
  - [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_dev_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_dev_mac.sh)
  - [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_beta_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_beta_mac.sh)
  - [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_stable_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_stable_mac.sh)

  In each case, the shell scripts download a browser installer package using `curl -k` and immediately install it:

  ```shell
  curl --retry 3 -o ./<pkg-file> -k <url>
  sudo installer -pkg /tmp/<pkg-file> -target /
  ```

  Disabling SSL verification (`-k`) means the download can be intercepted and replaced with malicious content.

  ### PoC
  A high-level exploitation scenario:

  1. An attacker performs a MitM attack on a network where the victim runs one of these scripts.
  2. The attacker intercepts the HTTPS request and serves a malicious package (for example, a trojaned browser installer).
  3. Because `curl -k` is used, the script downloads and installs the attacker's payload without any certificate validation.
  4. The attacker's code is executed with system privileges, leading to full compromise.

  No special configuration is needed: simply running these scripts on any untrusted or hostile network is enough.

  ### Impact
  This is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to improper SSL certificate validation (CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation). Any user or automation running these scripts is at risk of arbitrary code execution as root/admin, system compromise, data theft, or persistent malware installation. The risk is especially severe because browser packages are installed with elevated privileges and the scripts may be used in CI/CD or developer environments.
