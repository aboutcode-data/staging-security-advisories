summary: |
  jruby-openssl gem for JRuby fails to do proper certificate validation
  A security problem involving peer certificate verification was found where failed verification silently did nothing, making affected applications vulnerable to attackers. Attackers could lead a client application to believe that a secure connection to a rogue SSL server is legitimate. Attackers could also penetrate client-validated SSL server applications with a dummy certificate.
