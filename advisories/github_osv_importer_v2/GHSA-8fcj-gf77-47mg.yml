summary: "Denial of service (DoS) when processing Git credentials\n### Impact\n\nA denial of\
  \ services (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in Wrangler Git package affecting versions up\
  \ to and including `v1.0.0`.\n\nSpecially crafted Git credentials can result in a denial of\
  \ service (DoS) attack on an application that uses Wrangler due to the exhaustion of the available\
  \ memory and CPU resources. This is caused by a lack of input validation of Git credentials\
  \ before they are used, which may lead to a denial of service in some cases. This issue can\
  \ be triggered when accessing both private and public Git repositories. \n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nA workaround is to sanitize input passed to the Git package to remove potential unsafe and\
  \ ambiguous characters. Otherwise, the best course of action is to update to a patched Wrangler\
  \ version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include `v1.0.1` and later and the backported\
  \ tags - `v0.7.4-security1`, `v0.8.5-security1` and `v0.8.11`.\n\n### For more information\n\
  \nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher\
  \ Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related\
