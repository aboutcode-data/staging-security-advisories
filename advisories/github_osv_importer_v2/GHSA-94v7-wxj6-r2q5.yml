  multicast in source builds from vulnerable setuptools dependency
  ### Impact
   * Some source-builds may be impacted by a CWE-1395 (eg. vulnerable `setuptools` dependency).
     * Multicast prior to v2.0.9a3 on systems with minimal dependancies installed may use `setuptools <78.1.1` and thus rely on a compromised dependency. In some cases there is a chance that source-builds would fail due to an exploit of the closely related CVE-2025-47273, or become arbitrarily modified.

  ### Patches
   * Pre-release version v2.0.9a0 and later resolve the issue by bumping requirements to `setuptools>=80.4`
     * Pre-release version v2.0.9a3 and later are recommended for improved stability over v2.0.9a0

  ### Workarounds
   * Further hardening in v2.0.9a4+ of the build process in CI builds allowing source builds to be verified via GH attestations.
