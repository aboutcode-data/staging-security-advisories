summary: |
  Requests vulnerable to .netrc credentials leak via malicious URLs
  ### Impact

  Due to a URL parsing issue, Requests releases prior to 2.32.4 may leak .netrc credentials to third parties for specific maliciously-crafted URLs.

  ### Workarounds
  For older versions of Requests, use of the .netrc file can be disabled with `trust_env=False` on your Requests Session ([docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.Session.trust_env)).
