  Duplicate Advisory: Exposure of sensitive information in ClickHouse
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-g8ph-74m6-8m7r. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Exposure of sensitive information in exceptions in ClickHouse's clickhouse-r2dbc, com.clickhouse:clickhouse-jdbc, and com.clickhouse:clickhouse-client versions less than 0.4.6 allows unauthorized users to gain access to client certificate passwords via client exception logs. This occurs when 'sslkey' is specified and an exception, such as a ClickHouseException or SQLException, is thrown during database operations; the certificate password is then included in the logged exception message.
