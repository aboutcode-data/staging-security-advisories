aliases:
  - CVE-2024-46989
summary: |
  SpiceDB having multiple caveats on resources of the same type may improperly result in no permission
  ## Background

  Multiple caveats over the same indirect subject type on the same relation can result in no permission being returned when permission is expected

  For example, given this schema:

  ```
  definition user {}

  caveat somecaveat(somefield int) {
    somefield == 42
  }

  definition group {
    relation member: user
  }

  definition resource {
    relation viewer: group#member with somecaveat
    permission view = folder->view
  }
  ```

  If the resource has multiple groups, and each group is caveated, it is possible for the returned permission to be "no permission" when permission is expected.

  ## Impact
  Permission is returned as NO_PERMISSION when PERMISSION is expected on the CheckPermission API.

  ## Workarounds
  Do not use caveats or do not use caveats on an indirect subject type with multiple entries
