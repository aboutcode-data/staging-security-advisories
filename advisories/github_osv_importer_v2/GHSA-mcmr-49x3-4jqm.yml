  ckb type_id script resume may randomly fail
  ### Impact
  https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/v0.101.2/script/src/verify.rs#L871-L879
  TypeIdSystemScript resume handle is not correct when max_cycles is not enough, `ScriptError::ExceededMaximumCycles` will be raised directly ranther than suspend as expect, and also because script_group execution order is random, so this will happen randomly.
