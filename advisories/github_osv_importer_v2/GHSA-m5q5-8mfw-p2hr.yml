aliases:
  - CVE-2023-37266
summary: |
  CasaOS contains weak JWT secrets
  ### Impact

  Unauthenticated attackers can craft arbitrary JWTs and access features that usually require authentication and execute arbitrary commands as `root` on CasaOS instances.

  ### Patches

  The problem was addressed by improving the validation of JWTs in 705bf1f. This patch is part of CasaOS 0.4.4.

  ### Workarounds

  Users should upgrade to CasaOS 0.4.4. If they can't, they should temporarily restrict access to CasaOS to untrusted users, for instance by not exposing it publicly.
