  Better Auth Passkey Plugin allows passkey deletion through IDOR
  # Summary

  Affected versions of the better-auth passkey plugin allow users with any valid session to delete arbitrary passkeys via their ID using `POST /passkey/delete-passkey`.

  # Details

  `ctx.body.id` is implicitly trusted and used in passkey deletion queries.

  better-auth applications configured with `useNumberId` may use auto incrementing IDs which makes it trivial to delete all passkeys via enumeration.
