summary: |
  AVideo has Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Markdown Comment Injection
  ## Vulnerability Type
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — CWE-79.

  ## Affected Product/Versions
  AVideo 18.0.

  ## Root Cause Summary
  AVideo allows Markdown in video comments and uses Parsedown (v1.7.4) without Safe Mode enabled. Markdown links are not sufficiently sanitized, allowing `javascript:` URIs to be rendered as clickable links.

  ## Impact Summary
  An authenticated low-privilege attacker can post a malicious comment that injects persistent JavaScript. When another user clicks the link, the attacker can perform actions such as session hijacking, privilege escalation (including admin takeover), and data exfiltration.

  ## Resolution/Fix
  The issue was confirmed and fixed in the master branch. An official release will be published soon.

  ## Workarounds
  Until the release is available, validate and block unsafe URI schemes (e.g., `javascript:`) before rendering Markdown, and enable Parsedown Safe Mode.

  ## Credits/Acknowledgement
  Reported by Arkadiusz Marta (https://github.com/arkmarta/).
