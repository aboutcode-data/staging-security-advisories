  - CVE-2023-22466
summary: |
  Tokio reject_remote_clients configuration may get dropped when creating a Windows named pipe
  ### Impact

  When configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes the configuration. This also applies if `reject_remote_clients` is not explicitly set as this is the default configuration and is cleared by calling `pipe_mode`.

  Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publically shared folder (SMB).

  ### Patches

  The following versions have been patched:
  * 1.23.1
  * 1.20.3
  * 1.18.4

  The fix will also be present in all releases starting from version 1.24.0.

  Named pipes were introduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected.

  ### Workarounds

  Ensure that `pipe_mode` is set **first** after initializing a `ServerOptions`. For example:

  ```rust
  let mut opts = ServerOptions::new();
  opts.pipe_mode(PipeMode::Message);
  opts.reject_remote_clients(true);
  ```
