summary: |
  Helm May Panic Due To Incorrect YAML Content
  A Helm contributor discovered an improper validation of type error when parsing Chart.yaml and index.yaml files that can lead to a panic.

  ### Impact

  There are two areas of YAML validation that were impacted. First, when a `Chart.yaml` file had a `null` maintainer or the `child` or `parent` of a dependencies `import-values` could be parsed as something other than a string, `helm lint` would panic. Second, when an `index.yaml` had an empty entry in the list of chart versions Helm would panic on interactions with that repository.

  ### Patches

  This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.5.

  ### Workarounds

  Ensure YAML files are formatted as Helm expects prior to processing them with Helm.

  ### References

  Helm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.
