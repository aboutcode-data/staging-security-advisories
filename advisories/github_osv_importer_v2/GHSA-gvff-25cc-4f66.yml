summary: "Path Traversal in restify-swagger-jsdoc\nVersions of `restify-swagger-jsdoc` prior\
  \ to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to Path Traversal.  The package fails to properly sanitize URLs,\
  \ which may allow attackers to access server files outside the `swagger-ui` folder by using\
  \ relative paths.  \n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 3.2.1 or later."
