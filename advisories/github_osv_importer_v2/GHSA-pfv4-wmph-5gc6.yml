summary: |
  MCP Run Python has a Sandbox Escape & Server Takeover Vulnerability
  ### Impact
  **Critical Sandbox Escape & Server Takeover:**
  A critical security vulnerability exists in `mcp-run-python` due to a lack of isolation between the Python runtime (Pyodide) and the host JavaScript environment.

  The `runPython` and `runPythonAsync` functions execute Python code using Pyodide without restricting access to the JavaScript bridge. This allows any executed Python code—whether from a user or an AI model—to access the `js` module in Pyodide. Through this bridge, the Python code can modify the global JavaScript environment, interact with the Node.js process, and alter the behavior of the MCP server.

  **Specific Attack Vector: MCP Tool Shadowing**
  Because the Python code can modify the JS runtime, an attacker can dynamically overwrite or "shadow" existing MCP tools registered on the server. For example, an attacker could replace a secure file-reading tool with a malicious version that exfiltrates data to an external server, all while the MCP server appears to be functioning normally.

  ### Patches
  **No Patch Available:**
  The `mcp-run-python` project is currently **archived** and maintainers have indicated it is unlikely to receive a fix.

  **Recommendation:**
  Users are strongly advised to **immediately stop using** this package.
  If functionality is required, users must migrate to a maintained alternative that implements proper sandboxing (e.g., running Python in a Docker container or a restricted WASM environment with the JS bridge disabled).

  ### Workarounds
  There are no configuration-based workarounds. Securing the environment requires modifying the source code to disable the Pyodide-to-JS bridge or moving the execution environment to a fully isolated sandbox (e.g., a separate container).
