summary: |
  Grafana vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
  Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Starting with the 7.0 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability in the trace view visualization. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible due the value of a span's attributes/resources were not properly sanitized and this will be rendered when the span's attributes/resources are expanded. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change the value of a trace view visualization to contain JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.
