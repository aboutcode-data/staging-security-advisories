summary: "OpenFGA vulnerable to denial of service due to circular relationship\n### Overview\n\
  \nOpenFGA versions v1.1.0 and prior are vulnerable to a DoS attack when certain Check and\
  \ ListObjects calls are executed against authorization models that contain circular relationship\
  \ definitions.\n\n### Am I Affected?\n\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are\
  \ using OpenFGA v1.1.0 or earlier, and if you are executing certain [Check](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check)\
  \ or [ListObjects](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects) calls\
  \ against a vulnerable authorization model. To see which of your models could be vulnerable\
  \ to this attack, download OpenFGA v1.2.0 and run the following command: \n\n```\n./openfga\
  \ validate-models --datastore-engine <ENGINE> --datastore-uri <URI> | jq .[] | select(.Error\
  \ | contains(\"loop\"))\n```\n\nreplacing the variables `<ENGINE>` and `<URI>` as needed.\n\
  \n### Fix\n\nUpgrade to v1.1.1.\n\n### Backward Compatibility\n\nIf you are not passing an\
  \ invalid authorization model (as identified by running `./openfga validate-models`) as a\
  \ parameter of your Check and ListObjects calls, this upgrade is backwards compatible. \n\n\
  Otherwise, OpenFGA v1.1.1 will start returning HTTP 400 status codes on those calls."
