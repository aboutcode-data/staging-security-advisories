summary: |
  Microweber before 1.2.21 allows attacker to bypass IP detection to brute-force password
  In the login API, an IP address will by default be blocked when the user tries to login incorrectly more than 5 times. However, a bypass to this mechanism is possible by abusing a X-Forwarded-For header to bypass IP detection and perform a password brute-force. A patch for this issue is available in Microweber version 1.2.21.
