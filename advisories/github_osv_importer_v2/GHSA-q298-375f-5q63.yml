summary: |
  Snowflake JDBC Driver client-side encryption key in DEBUG logs
  ### Issue
  Snowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC driver (“Driver”). When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations,  and is not logged server-side by Snowflake.

  This vulnerability affects Driver versions 3.0.13 through 3.23.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1.

  ### Vulnerability Details
  When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would locally log the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. The key was logged in a JSON object under the queryStageMasterKey key. The key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data.

  ### Solution
  Snowflake released version 3.23.1 of the Snowflake JDBC driver, which fixes this issue. We highly recommend users upgrade to version 3.23.1.
