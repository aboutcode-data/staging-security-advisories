aliases:
  - CVE-2021-32702
summary: |
  Reflected XSS from the callback handler's error query parameter
  ### Overview

  Versions before and including `1.4.1` are vulnerable to reflected XSS.  An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing an XSS payload in the `error` query parameter which is then processed by the callback handler as an error message.

  ### Am I affected?
  You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` version `1.4.1` or lower **unless** you are using custom error handling that does not return the error message in an HTML response.

  ### How to fix that?
  Upgrade to version `1.4.2`.

  ### Will this update impact my users?
  The fix adds basic HTML escaping to the error message and it should not impact your users.
