summary: |
  Jenkins Team Concert Plugin cross-site request forgery vulnerability
  Jenkins Team Concert Plugin 1.3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
