  Prototype Pollution in mithril
  Affected versions of `mithril`are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The function `parseQueryString` may allow a malicious user to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects. A payload such as `__proto__%5BtoString%5D=123` in the query string would change the `toString()` function to `123`.



  ## Recommendation

  If you are using mithril 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.2 or later.
  If you are using mithril 1.x, upgrade to version 1.1.7 or later.
