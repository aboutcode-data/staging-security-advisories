summary: |
  mdanter/ecc affected by timing vulnerability in cryptographic side-channels
  phpecc, as used in **all versions** of mdanter/ecc, as well as paragonie/ecc before 2.0.1, has a branch-based timing leak in Point addition. (This Composer package is also known as phpecc/phpecc on GitHub, previously known as the Matyas Danter ECC library.)

  Paragon Initiative Enterprises [hard-forked phpecc/phpecc](https://github.com/phpecc/phpecc/issues/289) and discovered the issue in the original code, then released v2.0.1 which fixes the vulnerability. [The upstream code](https://github.com/phpecc/phpecc) is no longer maintained and remains vulnerable for all versions.
