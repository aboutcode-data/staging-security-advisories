  - CVE-2021-39152
summary: |
  A Server-Side Forgery Request can be activated unmarshalling with XStream to access data streams from an arbitrary URL referencing a resource in an intranet or the local host
  ### Impact
  The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream with a Java runtime version 14 to 8. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.

  ### Patches
  If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.18.

  ### Workarounds
  See [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.

  ### References
  See full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39152](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39152.html).
