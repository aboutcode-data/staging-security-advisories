  Malicious Package in rpc-websocket
  Versions of `rpc-websocket` >= 0.7.6 contained malicious code. The package opens a backdoor to a remote server and executes arbitrary commands, effectively acting as a backdoor.


  ## Recommendation

  Any computer that has these versions of the package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.

  The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.
