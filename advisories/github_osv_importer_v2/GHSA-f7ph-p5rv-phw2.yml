summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting in nunjucks
  Affected versions of `nunjucks` do not properly escape specially structured user input in template vars when in auto-escape mode, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

  ## Proof of Concept

  By using an array for the keys in a template var, escaping is bypassed.
  ```javascript
  name[]=<script>alert(1)</script>
  ```

  A full PoC is available in the references section.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 2.4.3 or later.
