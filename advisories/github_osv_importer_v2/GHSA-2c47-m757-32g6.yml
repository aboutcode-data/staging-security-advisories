summary: |
  Insufficient input sanitization in ejson2env
  ### Summary
  The `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically, the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However, due to inadequate output sanitization, there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content, resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

  ### Details
  The vulnerability exists because environment variables are not properly sanitized during the decryption phase, which enables malicious keys or encrypted values to inject commands.

  ### Impact
  An attacker with control over  `.ejson` files can inject commands in the environment where `source $(ejson2env)`  or `eval ejson2env` are executed.


  ### Mitigation
  - Update to a version of `ejson2env` that sanitizes the output during decryption or
  - Do not use `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets or
  - Do not evaluate or execute the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.
