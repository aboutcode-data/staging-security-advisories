summary: "pgjdbc Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability\n### Overview\nThe connection properties\
  \ for configuring a pgjdbc connection are not meant to be exposed to an unauthenticated attacker.\
  \ While allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary connection properties could lead to a compromise\
  \ of a system, that's a defect of an application that allows unauthenticated attackers that\
  \ level of control.\n\nIt's not the job of the pgjdbc driver to decide whether a given log\
  \ file location is acceptable. End user applications that use the pgjdbc driver must ensure\
  \ that filenames are valid and restrict unauthenticated attackers from being able to supply\
  \ arbitrary values. That's not specific to the pgjdbc driver either, it would be true for\
  \ any library that can write to the application's local file system.\n\nWhile we do not consider\
  \ this a security issue with the driver, we have decided to remove the loggerFile and loggerLevel\
  \ connection properties in the next release of the driver. Removal of those properties does\
  \ not make exposing the JDBC URL or connection properties to an attacker safe and we continue\
  \ to suggest that applications do not allow untrusted users to specify arbitrary connection\
  \ properties. We are removing them to prevent misuse and their functionality can be delegated\
  \ to java.util.logging.\n\nIf you identify an application that allows remote users to specify\
  \ a complete JDBC URL or properties without validating it's contents, we encourage you to\
  \ notify the application owner as that may be a security defect in that specific application.\n\
  \n### Impact\nIt is possible to specify an arbitrary filename in the loggerFileName connection\
  \ parameter\n\"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/test?user=test&password=test&loggerLevel=DEBUG&loggerFile=./blah.jsp&<%Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter(\\\
  \"i\\\"));%>\"\n\nThis creates a valid JSP file which could lead to a Remote Code Execution\
  \ \n\n### Patches\nLoggerFile implementation has been removed and will be ignored by the driver,\
  \ fixed in 42.3.3\n\n### Workarounds\nsanitize the inputs to the driver\n\nReported by Allan\
