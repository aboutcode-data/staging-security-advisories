aliases:
  - CVE-2024-31995
summary: |
  zcap has incomplete expiration checks in capability chains.
  ### Impact

  When invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material.

  ### Patches

  `@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking.

  ### Workarounds

  A zcap could be revoked at any time.
