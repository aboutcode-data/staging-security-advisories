summary: |
  URIjs Hostname spoofing via backslashes in URL
  ### Impact
  If using affected versions to determine a URL's hostname, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character as part of the scheme delimiter, e.g. `scheme:/\hostname`. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect.

  Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.

  Example URL: `https:/\expected-example.com/path`
  Escaped string: `https:/\\expected-example.com/path` (JavaScript strings must escape backslash)

  Affected versions incorrectly return no hostname. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the [WHATWG URL specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/), including web browsers and [Node's built-in URL class](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html).

  ### Patches
  Version 1.19.6 is patched against all known payload variants.
