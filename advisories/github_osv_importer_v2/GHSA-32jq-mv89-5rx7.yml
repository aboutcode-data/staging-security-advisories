summary: "CoreWCF NetFraming based services can leave connections open when they should be closed\n\
  ### Impact\nIf you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be\
  \ consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There\
  \ are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service\
  \ and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming\
  \ session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client\
  \ doesn't send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout,\
  \ the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted.  \nThe bindings\
  \ affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding.\
  \ Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections.\n\n### Patches\nThe\
  \ currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2\
  \ and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n\n###\
