aliases:
  - CVE-2021-22565
summary: |
  Insufficient Granularity of Access Control in github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server
  ### Impact
  Users or API keys with permission to expire verification codes could have expired codes that belonged to another realm if they guessed the UUID.

  ### Patches
  v1.1.2+

  ### Workarounds
  There are no workarounds, and there are no indications this has been exploited in the wild. Verification codes can only be expired by providing their 64-bit UUID, and verification codes are already valid for a very short period of time (thus the UUID rotates frequently).
