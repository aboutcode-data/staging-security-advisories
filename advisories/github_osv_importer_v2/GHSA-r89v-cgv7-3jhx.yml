  Bypass of fix for CVE-2020-15247, Twig sandbox escape
  ### Impact
  A bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469 and 1.1.0) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-15247:

  An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP.

  This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP.

  ### Patches
  Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) and v1.1.1.

  ### Workarounds
  Apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/d34fb8ab51108495a9a651b841202d935f4e12f7 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 470 or v1.1.1.
