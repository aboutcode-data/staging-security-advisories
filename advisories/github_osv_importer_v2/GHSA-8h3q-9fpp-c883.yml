summary: "Duplicate Advisory: Wrangler affected by OS Command Injection in `wrangler pages deploy`\n\
  ## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-36p8-mvp6-cv38.\
  \ This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n\n\
  SummaryA command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) has been found to exist in the `wrangler\
  \ pages deploy` command. The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed\
  \ directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker\
  \ with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.\n\
  \n\n\n\nRoot causeThe commitHash variable, derived from user input via the --commit-hash CLI\
  \ argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals (e.g.,  execSync(`git\
  \ show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell,\
  \ enabling command execution.\n\n\n\n\nImpactThis vulnerability is generally hard to exploit,\
  \ as it requires --commit-hash to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily affects\
  \ CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines and the\
  \ \n\n--commit-hash parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted sources. An\
  \ attacker could exploit this to:\n\n  *  Run any shell command.\n  *  Exfiltrate environment\
  \ variables.\n  *  Compromise the CI runner to install backdoors or modify build artifacts.\n\
  \n\n\nCredits Disclosed responsibly by kny4hacker.\n\n\n\n\nMitigation\n  *  Wrangler v4 users\
  \ are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.\n  *  Wrangler v3 users are requested\
  \ to upgrade to Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.\n  *  Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should upgrade\
  \ to a supported major version."
