  - CVE-2024-26130
summary: |
  cryptography NULL pointer dereference with pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates when called with a non-matching certificate and private key and an hmac_hash override
  If `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with both:

  1. A certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key
  2. An `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`

  Then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process.

  This has been resolved, and now a `ValueError` is properly raised.
