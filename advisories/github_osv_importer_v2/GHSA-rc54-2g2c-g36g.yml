  - CVE-2025-62705
summary: "OpenBao and Vault Leak []byte Fields in Audit Logs\n### Impact\n\nOpenBao's audit\
  \ log did not appropriately redact fields when relevant subsystems sent `[]byte` response\
  \ parameters rather than `string`s. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- `sys/raw` with\
  \ use of `encoding=base64`, all data would be emitted unredacted to the audit log.\n- Transit,\
  \ when performing a signing operation with a derived Ed25519 key, would emit public keys to\
  \ the audit log.\n\nThird-party plugins may be affected.\n\nThis issue has been present since\
  \ HashiCorp Vault and continues to impact Vault as of v1.20.4. \n\n### Patches\n\nOpenBao\
  \ v2.4.2 will patch this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf users do not use the above functionality,\
  \ they are not impacted. To prohibit the use of `sys/raw` globally, ensure `raw_storage_endpoint=false`\
  \ is set or missing from the server configuration."
