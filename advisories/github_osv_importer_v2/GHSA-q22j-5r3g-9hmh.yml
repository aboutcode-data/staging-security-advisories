aliases:
  - CVE-2023-44381
summary: |
  October CMS safe mode bypass using Page template injection
  ### Impact

  An authenticated backend user with the `editor.cms_pages`, `editor.cms_layouts`, or `editor.cms_partials` permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.safe_mode` being enabled can craft a special request to include PHP code in the CMS template.

  This is not a problem for anyone who trusts their users with those permissions to usually write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.safe_mode` enabled. Still, it would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.safe_mode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write and execute arbitrary PHP.

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in v3.4.15.

  ### Workarounds

  As a workaround, remove the specified permissions from untrusted users.
