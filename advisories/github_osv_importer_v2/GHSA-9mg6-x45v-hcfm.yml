summary: |
  activeadmin vulnerable to stored persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in dynamic form legends
  ### Impact

  Users settings their active admin form legends dynamically may be vulnerable to stored XSS, as long as its value can be injected directly by a malicious user.

  For example:

  * A public web application allows users to create entities with arbitrary names.
  * Active Admin is used to administrate these entities through a private backend.
  * The form to edit these entities in the private backend has the following shape (note the dynamic `name` value dependent on an attribute of the `resource`):

  ```ruby
    form do |f|
      f.inputs name: resource.name do
        f.input :name
        f.input :description
      end

      f.actions
    end
  ```

  Then a malicious user could create an entity with a payload that would get executed in the active admin administrator's browser.

  Both `form` blocks with an implicit or explicit name (i.e., both `form resource.name` or `form name: resource.name` would suffer from the problem), where the value of the name can be arbitrarily set by non admin users.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed in ActiveAdmin 3.2.2 and ActiveAdmin 4.0.0.beta7.

  ### Workarounds

  Users can workaround this problem without upgrading by explicitly escaping the form name using an HTML escaping utility. For example:

  ```ruby
    form do |f|
      f.inputs name: ERB::Util.html_escape(resource.name) do
        f.input :name
        f.input :description
      end

      f.actions
    end
  ```
  Upgrading is of course recommended though.
