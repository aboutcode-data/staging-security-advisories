  Sentry SDK Prototype Pollution gadget in JavaScript SDKs
  ### Impact
  In case a Prototype Pollution vulnerability is present in a user's application or bundled libraries, the Sentry SDK could potentially serve as a gadget to exploit that vulnerability. The exploitability depends on the specific details of the underlying Prototype Pollution issue.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This advisory does not indicate the presence of a Prototype Pollution within the Sentry SDK itself. Users are strongly advised to first address any Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities in their application, as they pose a more critical security risk.

  ### Patches
  The issue was patched in all Sentry JavaScript SDKs starting from the [8.33.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/8.33.0) version.
  Also, the fix was backported to SDK v7 in [7.119.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.119.1).
