  - CVE-2023-38200
summary: |
  Keylime's registrar vulnerable to Denial-of-service attack via a single open connection
  ### Impact
  Keylime `registrar` is prone to a simple denial of service attack in which an adversary opens a connection to the TLS port (by default, port `8891`) blocking further, legitimate connections. As long as the connection is open, the `registrar` is blocked and cannot serve any further clients (`agents` and `tenants`), which prevents normal operation. The problem does not affect the `verifier`.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to release 7.4.0
