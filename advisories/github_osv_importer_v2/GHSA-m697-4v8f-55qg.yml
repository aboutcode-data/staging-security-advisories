summary: |
  Header dropping in traefik
  # Impact

  There exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse.

  # Details

  If you have a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header `Important-Security-Header`, then sending a request with the following Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request was sent:

  ```
  curl 'https://example.com' -H "Connection: Important-Security-Header" -0
  ```

  In this case, the backend does not see the request header `Important-Security-Header`.

  # Patches

  Traefik v2.4.x: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.13

  # Workarounds
