  - CVE-2025-62370
summary: |
  alloy-dyn-abi has DoS vulnerability on `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` hashing
  ### Impact

  An uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to `alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData` could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via `eip712_signing_hash()`.

  Software with high availability requirements such as network services may be particularly impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting mechanisms can partially mitigate the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version [`v1.4.1`](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/1.4.1) and backported to [`v0.8.26`](https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/0.8.26).

  ### Workarounds

  There is no known workaround that mitigates the vulnerability. Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended course of action.
