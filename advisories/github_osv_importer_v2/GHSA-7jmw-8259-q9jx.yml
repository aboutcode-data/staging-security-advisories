summary: |
  Traefik has unexpected behavior with IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
  ### Impact

  There is a vulnerability in [Go managing various Is methods (IsPrivate, IsLoopback, etc) for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/XbxouI9gY7k/m/TuoGEhxIEwAJ).

  They didn't work as expected returning false for addresses which would return true in their traditional IPv4 forms.
