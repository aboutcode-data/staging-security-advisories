  - CVE-2021-32659
summary: "Automatic room upgrade handling can be used maliciously to bridge a room non-consentually\n\
  ### Impact\n\nIf a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts`\
  \ key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters\
  \ will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the\
  \ target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains\
  \ the previous room. This means that any mailcious admin of a bridged room can repoint the\
  \ traffic to a different room without the new room being aware.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nVersions\
  \ 2.6.1 and greater are patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisabling the automatic room upgrade\
  \ handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options.\
  \ \n\n### References\n\nThe issue is patched by https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/330\n\
  \n### For more information]\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory,\
  \ email us at security@matrix.org."
