  \ using the Argo Server with `--auth-mode=server` (which is the default < v3.0.0) AND have\
  \ exposed their UI to the Internet may allow remote users to execute arbitrary code on their\
  \ cluster, e.g. crypto-mining.\n\n### Resolution\n\n* Do not expose your user interface to\
  \ the Internet. \n* Change configuration. `--auth-mode=client`. \n\nFor users using an older\
