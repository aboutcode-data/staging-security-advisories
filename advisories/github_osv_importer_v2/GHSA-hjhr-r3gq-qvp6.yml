aliases:
  - CVE-2016-10535
summary: "Timing Attack in csrf-lite\nAffected versions of `csrf-lite` are vulnerable to timing\
  \ attacks as a result of testing CSRF tokens via a fail-early comparison instead of a constant-time\
  \ comparison. \n\nTiming attacks remove the exponential increase in entropy gained from increased\
  \ secret length, by providing per-character feedback on the correctness of a guess via miniscule\
  \ timing differences.\n\nUnder favorable network conditions, an attacker can exploit this\
  \ to guess the secret in no more than (16*18)288 guesses, instead of the 16^18 guesses required\
  \ were the timing attack not present. \n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.1.2 or\
  \ later."
