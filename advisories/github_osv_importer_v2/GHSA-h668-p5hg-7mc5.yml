summary: |
  Jenkins Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin cross-site request forgery vulnerability
  Jenkins Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.

  Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.
