summary: |
  LTI 1.3 Grade Pass Back Implementation has Missing Authorization Vulnerability
  ### Problem
  TL;DR: Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can
  post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows or can guess the
  block location for that XBlock.

  In LTI 1.3, LTI tools can "pass back" scores that learners earn while using
  LTI tools to the edX platform. The edX platform then stores those LTI
  scores in a separate table. If the right conditions are met, these scores
  are then persisted to the LMS grades tables.

  LTI tools can create what are called "line items" on the edX platform. A
  line item can be thought of as a column in a grade book; it stores results
  for a specific activity (i.e. XBlock) for a specific set of users (i.e.
  users in the course using the XBlock). A line item has an optional
  resource_link_id field, which is basically the XBlock location. An LTI tool
  can supply any value for this field.

  An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The code
  that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to
  upload the grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the
  associated line item. Because the LTI tool could have submitted any value
  for the resource_link_id field, this introduces the potential for a
  nefarious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform.

  ### Impact
  Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can post a
  grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows the resource_link_id
  (i.e. block location) for that XBlock.

  The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI XBlock grades.
