summary: |
  Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in django-jsonform's admin form.
  ### Description

  django-jsonform stores the raw JSON data of the db field in a hidden textarea on the admin page. However, that data was kept in the textarea after unescaping it using the `safe` template filter. This opens up possibilities for XSS attacks.

  This only affects the admin pages where the django-jsonform is rendered.

  ### Mitigation

  Upgrade to django-jsonform version 2.10.1 or later.
