  - CVE-2025-53000
summary: "nbconvert has an uncontrolled search path that leads to unauthorized code execution\
  \ on Windows\n### Summary\n\nOn Windows, converting a notebook containing SVG output to a\
  \ PDF results in unauthorized code execution. Specifically, a third party can create a `inkscape.bat`\
  \ file that defines a [Windows batch script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file), capable\
  \ of arbitrary code execution.\n\nWhen a user runs `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf` on a notebook\
  \ containing SVG output to a PDF on a Windows platform from this directory, the `inkscape.bat`\
  \ file is run unexpectedly.\n\n### Details\n_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing\
  \ to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._\n\n`nbconvert` searches\
  \ for an `inkscape` executable when converting notebooks to PDFs here: https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/blob/4f61702f5c7524d8a3c4ac0d5fc33a6ac2fa36a7/nbconvert/preprocessors/svg2pdf.py#L104\n\
  \nThe MITRE page on [CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)\
  \ summarizes the root cause succinctly:\n\n> In Windows-based systems, when the `LoadLibrary`\
  \ or `LoadLibraryEx` function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified\
  \ path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be\
  \ uncontrolled:\n> - the directory from which the program has been loaded\n> - the current\
  \ working directory\n\n### PoC\n\n_Complete instructions, including specific configuration\
  \ details, to reproduce the vulnerability._\n\n1. Create a directory containing: \n\n    -\
  \ A hidden bat file called `inkscape.bat` containing `msg * \"You've been hacked!\"`\n\n \
  \   - A dummy ipynb file called `Machine_Learning.ipynb`\n\n2. Run the command `jupyter nbconvert\
  \ --to pdf Machine_Learning.ipynb`.\n\n3. Wait a few seconds, and you should see a popup showing\
  \ the message \"You've been hacked!\" \n\n### Impact\n\nAll Windows users."
