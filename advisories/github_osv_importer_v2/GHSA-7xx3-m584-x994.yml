  - CVE-2019-16770
summary: |
  ## Keepalive thread overload/DoS

  ### Impact

  A poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack.

  If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough.

  ### Patches

  This vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.

  ### Workarounds

  Reverse proxies in front of Puma could be configured to always allow less than X keepalive connections to a Puma cluster or process, where X is the number of threads configured in Puma's thread pool.
