  - CVE-2020-36208
summary: |
  Data races in conquer-once
  Affected versions of conquer-once implements Sync for its OnceCell type without restricting it to Sendable types.

  This allows non-Send but Sync types such as MutexGuard to be sent across threads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent programs.

  The issue was fixed by adding a Send constraint to OnceCell.
