  - CVE-2023-49568
summary: "Maliciously crafted Git server replies can cause DoS on go-git clients\n### Impact\n\
  A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.11`.\
  \ This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing\
  \ specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in `go-git`\
  \ clients. \n\nApplications using only the in-memory filesystem supported by `go-git` are\
  \ not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not\
  \ affect the upstream `git` cli.\n\n### Patches\nUsers running versions of `go-git` from `v4`\
  \ and above are recommended to upgrade to `v5.11` in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nIn cases where a bump to the latest version of `go-git` is not possible,\
  \ we recommend limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers.\n\n## Credit\nThanks to\
  \ Ionut Lalu for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability to us.\n\n### References\n- [GHSA-mw99-9chc-xw7r](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/security/advisories/GHSA-mw99-9chc-xw7r)"
