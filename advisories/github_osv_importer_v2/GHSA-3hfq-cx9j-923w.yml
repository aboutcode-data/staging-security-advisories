  - CVE-2023-47630
summary: "Attacker can cause Kyverno user to unintentionally consume insecure image\nAn issue\
  \ was found in Kyverno that allowed an attacker to control the digest of images used by Kyverno\
  \ users. The issue would require the attacker to compromise the registry that the Kyverno\
  \ fetch their images from. The attacker could then return a vulnerable image to the the user\
  \ and leverage that to further escalate their position. As such, the attacker would need to\
  \ know which images the Kyverno user consumes and know of one of multiple exploitable vulnerabilities\
  \ in previous digests of the images. Alternatively, if the attacker has compromised the registry,\
  \ they could craft a malicious image with a different digest with intentionally placed vulnerabilities\
  \ and deliver the image to the user. \n\nAn attacker was not be able to control other parameters\
  \ of the image than the digest by exploiting this vulnerability.\n\nUsers pulling their images\
  \ from trusted registries are not impacted by this vulnerability. There is no evidence of\
  \ this being exploited in the wild.\n\nThe issue has been patched in 1.11.0. \n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ was found during an ongoing security audit of Kyverno conducted by Ada Logics, facilitated\
  \ by OSTIF and funded by the CNCF.\n\nMembers of the community have raised concerns over the\
  \ similarity between this vulnerability and the one identified with CVE-2023-46737; They are\
  \ two different issues with two different root causes and different levels of impact. Some\
  \ differences are:\n\n- The current advisory (GHSA-3hfq-cx9j-923w) has its root cause in Kyverno\
  \ whereas the root cause of CVE-2023-46737 is in Cosigns code base. \n- The impact of the\
  \ current advisory (GHSA-3hfq-cx9j-923w) is that an attacker can trick Kyverno into consuming\
  \ a different image than the one the user requested; The impact of CVE-2023-46737 is an endless\
  \ data attack resulting in a denial-of-service.\n- The fix of the current advisory (GHSA-3hfq-cx9j-923w)\
  \ does not result in users being secure from CVE-2023-46737 and vice versa."
