aliases:
  - CVE-2023-29524
summary: |
  XWiki Platform vulnerable to code injection from account through XWiki.SchedulerJobSheet
  ### Impact

  It's possible to execute anything with the right of the Scheduler Application sheet page.

  To reproduce:
  1. As a user without script or programming rights, edit your user profile with the object editor and add a new object of type XWiki.SchedulerJobClass (search for "Scheduler")
  1. In "Job Script", add the following
    ```{{/code}} {{async async="true" cached="false" context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from groovy!"){{/groovy} {{/async}}```
  1. Click "Save & View"
  1. If the job information isn't already displayed (you should see "Job Name", "Job Description", etc.), append ?sheet=XWiki.SchedulerJobSheet to the URL.

  ### Patches

  This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.3 and 15.0 RC1.

  ### Workarounds

  While the fix in the scheduler itself is easy, it relies on the code macro `source` parameter, which was introduced in 14.10.2 so you have to upgrade to benefit from it.
