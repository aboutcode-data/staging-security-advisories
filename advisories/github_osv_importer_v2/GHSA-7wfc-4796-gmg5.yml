summary: "ZITADEL Vulnerable to Unauthenticated Full-Read SSRF via V2 Login\n### Summary\n\n\
  Zitadel is vulnerable to an unauthenticated, full-read SSRF vulnerability. An unauthenticated\
  \ remote attacker can force Zitadel into making HTTP requests to arbitrary domains, including\
  \ internal addresses. The server then returns the upstream response to the attacker, enabling\
  \ data exfiltration from internal services.\n\n### Impact\n\nZITADEL Login UI (V2) was vulnerable\
  \ to service URL manipulation through the x-zitadel-forward-host header. The service URL resolution\
  \ logic treated the header as a trusted fallback for all deployments, including self-hosted\
  \ instances. This allowed unauthenticated attacker to force the server to make outbound requests\
  \ and read the responses, reaching internal services, exfiltrating data, and bypassing IP-based\
  \ or network-segmentation controls. \n \n### Affected Versions\n\nSystems using the login\
  \ UI (v2) and running one of the following versions are affected:\n- **v4.x**: `4.0.0-rc.1`\
  \ through `4.7.0`\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed in the latest release.\
  \ The patch resolves the issue by correctly validating the x-zitadel-forward-host, resp. all\
  \ forwarded headers against the instance domains and trusted domains. It's no longer used\
  \ to route traffic to the Zitadel API.\n\nBefore you upgrade, ensure that:\n- the `ZITADEL_API_URL`\
  \ is set and is pointing to your instance, resp. system in multi-instance deployments.\n-\
  \ the HTTP `host` (or a `x-forwarded-host`) is passed in your reverse proxy to the login UI.\n\
  - a `x-zitadel-instance-host` (or `x-zitadel-forward-host`) is set in your reverse for multi-instance\
  \ deployments. If you're running a single instance solution, you don't need to take any actions.\n\
  \nFixed versions:\n- 4.x: Upgrade to >=[4.7.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.7.1)\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nThe recommended solution is to update ZITADEL to a patched version.\n\
  \nA ZITADEL fronting proxy can be configured to delete all `x-zitadel-forward-host` header\
  \ values or set it to the requested host before sending requests to ZITADEL self-hosted environments.\n\
  \n### Questions\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email\
  \ us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Amit\
  \ Laish – GE Vernova for finding and reporting the vulnerability."
