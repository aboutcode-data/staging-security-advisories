  - CVE-2021-41146
summary: |
  Arbitrary command execution on Windows via qutebrowserurl: URL handler
  ### Impact
  Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser registers it as a handler for certain URL schemes. With some applications such as Outlook Desktop, opening a specially crafted URL can lead to argument injection, allowing execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`.

  Only Windows installs where qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. It does *not* have to be set as default browser for the exploit to work.

  ### Patches
  The issue has been fixed in [qutebrowser v2.4.0](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/releases/tag/v2.4.0) in commit 8f46ba3f6dc7b18375f7aa63c48a1fe461190430.

  The fix also adds additional hardening for potential similar issues on Linux (by adding the new `--untrusted-args` flag to the `.desktop` file), though no such vulnerabilities are known.

  Backported patches for older versions are available, but no further releases are planned:

  - v1.7.x: d1ceaab
  - v1.8.x: ca7155d
  - v1.9.x: 157d871
  - v1.10.x: 94a6125
  - v1.11.x: 10acfbb
  - v1.12.x: 363a18f
  - v1.13.x: 410f262
  - v1.14.x: e4f4d93
  - v2.0.x: 15a1654
  - v2.1.x: 509ddf2
  - v2.2.x: 03dcba5
  - v2.3.x: 00a694c

  (commits are referring to qutebrowser/qutebrowser on GitHub)

  ### Workarounds
  Remove qutebrowser from the default browser settings entirely, so that it does not handle any kind of URLs. Make sure to remove *all* handlers, including an (accidental) `qutebrowserURL` handler, e.g. using [NirSoft URLProtocolView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/url_protocol_view.html).
