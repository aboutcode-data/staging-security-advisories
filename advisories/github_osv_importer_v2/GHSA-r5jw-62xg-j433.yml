summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting in Kaminari
  ### Impact
  In Kaminari before 1.2.1, there is a vulnerability that would allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into pages with pagination links. This has been fixed in 1.2.1.

  ### Releases
  The 1.2.1 gem including the patch has already been released.
  All past released versions are affected by this vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds
  Application developers who can't update the gem can workaround by overriding the `PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST` constant.

  ```ruby
  module Kaminari::Helpers
    PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST = [:authenticity_token, :commit, :utf8, :_method, :script_name, :original_script_name].freeze
  end
  ```

  ### Credits
  Thanks to Daniel Mircea for finding the issue and sending a patch via GitHub. Also thanks to Aditya Prakash for reporting the vulnerability.
