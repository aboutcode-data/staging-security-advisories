summary: |
  Jenkins ElectricFlow Plugin missing permission check
  A missing permission check in a form validation method in CloudBees CD Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.

  Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

  This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.
