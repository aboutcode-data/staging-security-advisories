  - CVE-2020-15254
summary: |
  crossbeam-channel Undefined Behavior before v0.4.4
  ### Impact

  The affected version of this crate's the `bounded` channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements.

  ### Patches

  This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.

  We recommend users to upgrade to 0.4.4.
