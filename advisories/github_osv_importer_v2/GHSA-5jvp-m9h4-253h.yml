summary: "Fleet: Authorization Bypass in certificate template batch deletion for team administrators\n\
  ### Summary\n\nA broken authorization check in Fleet’s certificate template deletion API could\
  \ allow a team administrator to delete certificate templates belonging to other teams within\
  \ the same Fleet instance.\n\n### Impact\n\nFleet supports certificate templates that are\
  \ scoped to individual teams. In affected versions, the batch deletion endpoint validated\
  \ authorization using a user-supplied team identifier but did not verify that the certificate\
  \ template IDs being deleted actually belonged to that team.\n\nAs a result, a team administrator\
  \ could delete certificate templates associated with other teams, potentially disrupting certificate-based\
  \ workflows such as device enrollment, Wi-Fi authentication, VPN access, or other certificate-dependent\
  \ configurations for the affected teams.\n\nThis issue does not allow privilege escalation,\
  \ access to sensitive data, or compromise of Fleet’s control plane. Impact is limited to integrity\
  \ and availability of certificate templates across teams.\n\n### Patches\n\n- v4.80.1\n\n\
  ### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators should restrict\
  \ access to certificate template management to trusted users and avoid delegating team administrator\
  \ permissions where not strictly required.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf there are any\
  \ questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail Fleet at [security@fleetdm.com](mailto:security@fleetdm.com)\
  \  \nJoin #fleet in [osquery Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw)\n\
  \n### Credits\n\nFleet thanks @secfox-ai for responsibly reporting this issue."
