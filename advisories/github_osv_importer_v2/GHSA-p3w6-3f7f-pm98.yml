  - CVE-2023-28675
summary: |
  Jenkins OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin missing permission check allows for unauthorized server connections
  Jenkins OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin Plugin 4.5.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to a previously configured Octoperf server using attacker-specified credentials.

  Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  OctoPerf Load Testing Plugin Plugin 4.5.3 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
