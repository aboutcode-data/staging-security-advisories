  HTML Injection in preact
  Versions of `preact` 10.x on prerelease tags alpha and beta prior to 10.0.0-beta.1 are vulnerable to HTML Injection. Due to insufficient input validation the package allows attackers to inject JavaScript objects as virtual-dom nodes, which may lead to Cross-Site Scripting. This requires user input parsed with `JSON.parse()` to be passed directly into JSX without sanitization.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 10.0.0-beta.1.
