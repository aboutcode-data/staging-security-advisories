summary: "Prototype Pollution in @hapi/hoek\nVersions of `@hapi/hoek` prior to 8.5.1 and 9.0.3\
  \ are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `clone` function fails to prevent the modification\
  \ of the Object prototype when passed specially-crafted input. Attackers may use this to change\
  \ existing properties that exist in all objects, which may lead to Denial of Service or Remote\
  \ Code Execution in specific circumstances.  \nThis issue __does not__ affect hapi applications\
  \ since the framework protects against such malicious inputs. Applications that use `@hapi/hoek`\
  \ outside of the hapi ecosystem may be vulnerable.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version\
  \ 8.5.1, 9.0.3 or later."
