  - CVE-2025-64144
summary: |
  Jenkins ByteGuard Build Actions Plugin stores API tokens unencrypted in job config.xml files
  Jenkins ByteGuard Build Actions Plugin 1.0 and earlier stores API tokens unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

  These tokens can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

  Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these credentials, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
