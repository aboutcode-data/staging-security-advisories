summary: "Fiber has an Arbitrary File Read in Static Middleware on Windows\n### Summary\n\n\
  **Description**\nA Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability in Fiber allows a remote attacker\
  \ to bypass the static middleware sanitizer and read arbitrary files on the server file system\
  \ on Windows. This affects Fiber v3 through version 3.0.0. This has been patched in Fiber\
  \ v3 version 3.1.0.\n \n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in `middleware/static/static.go`\
  \ within the `sanitizePath` function. This function attempts to sanitize the requested path\
  \ by checking for backslashes, decoding the URL, and then cleaning the path.\n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ stems from two combined issues:\n- The check for backslash characters happens before the\
  \ URL decoding loop. If an attacker sends a double-encoded backslash, the initial check sees\
  \ `%255C` and passes. The loop then decodes this into a single backslash.\n- The function\
  \ uses `path.Clean` to clean the resulting string. `path.Clean` is designed for slash-separated\
  \ paths  and does not recognize backslashes as directory separators. Consequently, sequences\
  \ like `..\\..\\` are treated as valid filenames.\n\nWhen this sanitized path is later used,\
  \ the backslashes are interpreted as valid separators, allowing the attacker to traverse up\
  \ the directory tree.\n```go\n// pkg/static/static.go\nfunc sanitizePath(p []byte, filesystem\
  \ fs.FS) ([]byte, error) {\n    ...\n    // this check happens BEFORE decoding\n    if bytes.IndexByte(p,\
  \ '\\\\') >= 0 {\n        ...\n    } \n    // This loop decodes %255C to %5C to \\\n    for\
  \ strings.IndexByte(s, '%') >= 0 {\n        us, err := url.PathUnescape(s)\n        ...\n\
  \        s = us\n    }\n    // path.Clean only understands forward slashes (/)\n    s = pathpkg.Clean(\"\
  /\" + s)\n    ...\n    return utils.UnsafeBytes(s), nil\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis impacts\
  \ Fiber v3 prereleases through stable release version 3.0.0.\n\nSuccessful exploitation requires\
  \ the server to be using the static middleware on Windows, as this is the only OS where backslashes\
  \ are treated as directory separators by the file system.\n\nExploitation allows directory\
  \ traversal on the host server. An attacker can read arbitrary files within the scope of the\
  \ application server context. Depending on permissions and deployment conditions, attackers\
  \ may access sensitive files outside the web root, such as configuration files, source code,\
  \ or system files. Leaking application secrets often leads to further compromise.\n\n### Patches\n\
  \nThis has been [patched](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/4064) in Fiber v3 version\
  \ 3.1.0.  Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release."
