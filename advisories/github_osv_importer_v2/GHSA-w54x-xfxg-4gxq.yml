summary: "NeuVector process with sensitive arguments lead to leakage\n### Impact\n\nWhen a Java\
  \ command with password parameters is executed and terminated by NeuVector for Process rule\
  \ violation. For example, \n\n```\njava -cp /app ... Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<Password>\n\
  ```\n\nThe command with the password appears in the NeuVector security event. To prevent this,\
  \ NeuVector uses the following default regular expression to detect and redact sensitive data\
  \ from process commands:\n\n```\n(?i)(password|passwd|token)\n```\n\nAlso, you can define\
  \ custom patterns to redact by creating a Kubernetes ConfigMap. For example:\n\n```\nkubectl\
  \ create configmap neuvector-custom-rules --from-file=secret-patterns.yaml -n neuvector\n\
  ```\n\nSample `secret-patterns.yaml` content:\n\n```\nPattern_list:\n  - (?i)(pawd|pword)\n\
  \  - (?i)(secret)\n```\n\nNeuVector uses the default and custom regex to decide whether the\
  \ process command in a security event should be redacted.\n\n**Note:** If numerous regular\
  \ expression (regex) patterns are configured in the Kubernetes ConfigMap for extended coverage\
  \ of sensitive data matching, it can significantly impact performance of NeuVector enforcer,\
  \ particularly in scenarios involving large inputs or frequent execution. The primary factor\
  \ contributing to performance issues in regex is backtracking, where the regex engine attempts\
  \ various matching paths when a pattern doesn't immediately find a match.\n\n### Patches\n\
  \nThis issue is fixed in NeuVector version **5.4.6** and later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere\
  \ is no workaround. Upgrade to a patched version of NeuVector as soon as possible.\n\n###\
