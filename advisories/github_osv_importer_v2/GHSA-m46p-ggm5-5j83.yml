  - CVE-2014-0081
summary: "Rails vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting\nThere is an XSS vulnerability in the `number_to_currency`,\
  \ `number_to_percentage` and `number_to_human` helpers in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability\
  \ has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0081.\n\nVersions Affected:  All.\nFixed Versions:\
  \     4.1.0.beta2, 4.0.3, 3.2.17.\n\nImpact\n------\nThese helpers allows users to nicely\
  \ format a numeric value. Some of the parameters to the helper (format, negative_format and\
  \ units) are not escaped correctly. Applications which pass user controlled data as one of\
  \ these parameters are vulnerable to an XSS attack.\n\nAll users passing user controlled data\
  \ to these parameters of the number helpers should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds\
  \ immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe 4.1.0.rc1, 4.0.3 and 3.2.17 releases are available\
  \ at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\n\nThe workaround for this issue is\
  \ to escape the value passed to the parameter.\nFor example, replace code like this:\n\n```ruby\n\
  <%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: params[:format]) %>\n```\n\nWith code like this\n\n```ruby\n\
  <%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: h(params[:format])) %>\n```\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid\
  \ users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported\
  \ release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n* 4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch\
  \ - Patch for 4.1-beta series\n* 4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 4.0 series\n* 3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch\
  \ - Patch for 3.2 series\n\nPlease note that only the 4.0.x and 3.2.x series are supported\
  \ at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible\
  \ as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.\n\
  \nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to Kevin Reintjes for reporting the issue to us.\n\n-- \nAaron\
