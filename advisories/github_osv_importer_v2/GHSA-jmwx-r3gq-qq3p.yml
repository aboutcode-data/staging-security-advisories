  vec-const attempts to construct a Vec from a pointer to a const slice
  Affected versions of this crate claimed to construct a const `Vec` with nonzero length and capacity, but that cannot be done because such a `Vec` requires a pointer from an allocator.

  The implementation was later changed to just construct a `std::borrow::Cow`.
