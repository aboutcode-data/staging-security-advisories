  - CVE-2020-36211
summary: |
  Data races in gfwx
  In the affected versions of this crate, ImageChunkMut<'_, T> unconditionally implements Send and Sync, allowing to create data races.

  This can result in a memory corruption or undefined behavior when non thread-safe types are moved and referenced across thread boundaries.

  The flaw was corrected in commit e7fb2f5 by adding T: Send bound to the Send impl and adding T: Sync bound to the Sync impl.
