  - CVE-2026-24130
summary: |
  Moonraker affected by LDAP search filter injection
  ### Impact

  Instances of Moonraker configured with the `ldap` component enabled are vulnerable to LDAP search filter injection techniques via the login endpoint.   The 401 error response message can be used to determine whether or not a search was successful, allowing for brute force methods to discover LDAP entries on the server such as user IDs and user attributes.

  ### Patches

  Users should upgrade to Moonraker 0.10.0 which patches this vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds

  Admins can set the `max_login_attempts` option in the `[authorization]` section to a reasonable value.    Any IP attempting to exploit this vulnerability will be locked out after it has reached the specified number of consecutive failed login attempts.  This condition is cleared after a Moonraker restart.   Note that if an attacker knows a valid user password they can bypass this protection by successfully logging in.

  The most secure workaround for users unable to upgrade is to remove the `ldap` section from `moonraker.conf` and rely on the built in user authentication.
