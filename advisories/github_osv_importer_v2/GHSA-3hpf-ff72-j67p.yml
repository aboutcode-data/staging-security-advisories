  shared_preferences_android vulnerability
  ### Impact
  Due to some data types not being natively representable for the available storage options, shared_preferences_android serializes and deserializes special string prefixes to store these unrepresentable data types. This allows arbitrary classes to be deserialized leading to arbitrary code execution.

  As a result, Files containing the preferences can be overwritten with a malicious one with a deserialization payload that triggers as soon as the data is loaded from the disk.

  ### Patches
  2.3.4

  ### Workarounds
  Update to the latest version of shared_preferences_android that contains the changes to address this vulnerability.

  ### References
  TBD
