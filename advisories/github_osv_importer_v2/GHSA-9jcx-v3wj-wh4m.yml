summary: |
  React Router has unexpected external redirect via untrusted paths
  An attacker-supplied path can be crafted so that when a React Router application navigates to it via `navigate()`, `<Link>`, or `redirect()`, the app performs a navigation/redirect to an external URL. This is only an issue if developers pass untrusted content into navigation paths in their application code.
