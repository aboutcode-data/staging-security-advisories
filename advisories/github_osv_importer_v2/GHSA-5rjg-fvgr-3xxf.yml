summary: "setuptools has a path traversal vulnerability in PackageIndex.download that leads\
  \ to Arbitrary File Write\n### Summary \nA path traversal vulnerability in `PackageIndex`\
  \ was fixed in setuptools version 78.1.1\n\n### Details\n```\n    def _download_url(self,\
  \ url, tmpdir):\n        # Determine download filename\n        #\n        name, _fragment\
  \ = egg_info_for_url(url)\n        if name:\n            while '..' in name:\n           \
  \     name = name.replace('..', '.').replace('\\\\', '_')\n        else:\n            name\
  \ = \"__downloaded__\"  # default if URL has no path contents\n\n        if name.endswith('.[egg.zip](http://egg.zip/)'):\n\
  \            name = name[:-4]  # strip the extra .zip before download\n\n -->       filename\
  \ = os.path.join(tmpdir, name)\n```\n\nHere: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/6ead555c5fb29bc57fe6105b1bffc163f56fd558/setuptools/package_index.py#L810C1-L825C88\n\
  \n`os.path.join()` discards the first argument `tmpdir` if the second begins with a slash\
  \ or drive letter.\n`name` is derived from a URL without sufficient sanitization. While there\
  \ is some attempt to sanitize by replacing instances of '..' with '.', it is insufficient.\n\
  \n### Risk Assessment\nAs easy_install and package_index are deprecated, the exploitation\
  \ surface is reduced.\nHowever, it seems this could be exploited in a similar fashion like\
  \ https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9hx-vwmv-q579, and as described by POC 4 in https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cx63-2mw6-8hw5\
  \ report: via malicious URLs present on the pages of a package index.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker\
  \ would be allowed to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem with the permissions\
  \ of the process running the Python code, which could escalate to RCE depending on the context.\n\
