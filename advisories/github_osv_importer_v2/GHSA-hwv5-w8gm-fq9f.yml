summary: "Directory Traversal vulnerability in GET/PUT allows attackers to Disclose Information\
  \ or Write Files via a crafted GET/PUT request\n### Impact\n\n#### Information Disclosure\n\
  \nWhen the GET method is attacked, attackers can read files which have a `.data` suffix and\
  \ which are accompanied by a JSON file with the `.meta` suffix. This can lead to Information\
  \ Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication\
  \ or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic.\n\nFor example, in a scenario where\
  \ a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT\
  \ settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files\
  \ from any other instance to which the process has read access.\n\nIf instances have individual\
  \ authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering)\
  \ or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a\
  \ scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances.\n\n\
  #### File Write\n\nIf the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious,\
  \ they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained\
  \ to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with\
  \ the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nPR #12 fixes the issue. The PR has been merged into version 0.4.0 and 0.4.0\
  \ has been released and pushed to PyPI. Users are advised to upgrade immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \n- Apache can apparently be configured to filter such malicious paths when reverse-proxying.\
  \ \n- There are no other workarounds known.\n\n### References\n\n- [Pull Request #12](https://github.com/horazont/xmpp-http-upload/pull/12)"
