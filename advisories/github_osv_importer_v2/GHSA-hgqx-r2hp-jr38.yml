summary: "TinyMCE XSS vulnerability in notificationManager.open API\n### Impact\nA [cross-site\
  \ scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered\
  \ in TinyMCE’s Notification Manager API. The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification\
  \ system, which is used in error handling.  The conditions for this exploit requires carefully\
  \ crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a notification to have\
  \ been triggered.  \n\nWhen a notification was opened, the HTML within the text argument was\
  \ displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript\
  \ execution when an notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user.  This issue\
  \ could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display\
  \ unfiltered HTML content.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE\
  \ 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML displayed in the notification is sanitized,\
  \ preventing the exploit.\n\n### Fix\nTo avoid this vulnerability:\n\n* Upgrade to TinyMCE\
  \ 5.10.8 or higher for TinyMCE 5.x.\n* Upgrade to TinyMCE 6.7.1 or higher for TinyMCE 6.x.\n\
