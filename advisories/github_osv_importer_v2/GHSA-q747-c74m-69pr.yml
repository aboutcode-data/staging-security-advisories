  - CVE-2025-55155
summary: |
  MantisBT lacks verification when changing a user's email address
  When a user edits their profile to change their e-mail address, the system saves it without validating that it actually belongs to the user.

  ### Impact
  This could result in storing an invalid email address, preventing the user from receiving system notifications.

  Notifications sent to another person's email address could lead to information disclosure.

  ### Patches
  Fixed in 2.27.2.

  ### Workarounds
  None

  ### Credits

  Thanks to @ncrcs for discovering and reporting the issue.
