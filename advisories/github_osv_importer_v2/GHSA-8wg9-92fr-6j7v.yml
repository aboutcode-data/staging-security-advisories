  - CVE-2016-10648
summary: "marionette-socket-host downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `marionette-socket-host`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `marionette-socket-host`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available\
  \ for this vulnerability, and the package author has removed the package from their Github\
  \ account.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different\
  \ package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring\
  \ that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is\
  \ installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those\
  \ who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such\
  \ as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
