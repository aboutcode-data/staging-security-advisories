  Cross-Site Scripting in Bootstrap Package
  ### Problem
  It has been discovered that rendering content in the website frontend is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

  The following templates are affected by the vulnerability:

  * `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/CallToAction.html`
  * `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/Header.html`
  * `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/Text.html`
  * `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Carousel/Item/TextAndImage.html`
  * `Resources/Private/Partials/ContentElements/Header/SubHeader.html`

  Users of the extension, who have overwritten  the affected templates with custom code must manually apply the security fix as shown in [this Git commit](https://github.com/benjaminkott/bootstrap_package/commit/de3a568fc311d6712d9339643e51e8627c80530b).

  Updated version are available from the TYPO3 extension manager, Packagist and at https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/download/bootstrap_package/.
