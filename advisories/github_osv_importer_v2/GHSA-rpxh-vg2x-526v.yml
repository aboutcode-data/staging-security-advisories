  - CVE-2021-32720
summary: "List of order ids, number, items total and token value exposed for unauthorized uses\
  \ via new API\n### Impact\n\nPart of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and\
  \ token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly,\
  \ a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping\
  \ may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however,\
  \ could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition\
  \ to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders\
  \ or their value in the moment of time. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched at\
  \ Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are a few ways to fix this without updating\
  \ the code. \n\nThe first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the\
  \ firewall from not logged in users. In order to achieve it one has to add the configuration\
  \ in `config/packages/security.yaml`:\n```yaml\n    access_control:\n        # ... \n    \
  \    - { path: \"%sylius.security.new_api_shop_regex%/orders\", role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY,\
  \ methods: [POST] }\n        - { path: \"%sylius.security.new_api_shop_regex%/orders\", role:\
  \ ROLE_USER, methods: [GET] }\n```\nThis would put only the order list under the firewall\
  \ and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access\
  \ to theirs orders only.\n\nThe second possible solution is to decorate the `\\Sylius\\Bundle\\\
  ApiBundle\\Doctrine\\QueryCollectionExtension\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\\
  Component\\Security\\Core\\Exception\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for\
  \ unauthorized user."
