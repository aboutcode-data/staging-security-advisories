summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability in Action Pack
  There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rails / Action Pack. This vulnerability has been
  assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-22577.

  Versions Affected:  >= 5.2.0
  Not affected:       < 5.2.0
  Fixed Versions:     7.0.2.4, 6.1.5.1, 6.0.4.8, 5.2.7.1

  ## Impact

  CSP headers were only sent along with responses that Rails considered as
  "HTML" responses.  This left API requests without CSP headers, which could
  possibly expose users to XSS attacks.

  ## Releases

  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

  ## Workarounds

  Set a CSP for your API responses manually.
