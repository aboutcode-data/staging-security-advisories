summary: |
  Jenkins AppSpider Plugin missing permission check
  Jenkins AppSpider Plugin 1.0.15 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL and send an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload consisting of attacker-specified credentials.

  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  AppSpider Plugin 1.0.16 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.
