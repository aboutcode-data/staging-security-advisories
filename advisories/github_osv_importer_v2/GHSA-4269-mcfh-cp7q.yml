aliases:
  - CVE-2025-59034
summary: |
  Indico may disclose unauthorized user details access via legacy API
  ### Impact
  A legacy API to retrieve user details could be misused to retrieve profile details of other users without having admin permissions due to a broken access check.

  ### Patches
  You should to update to [Indico 3.3.8](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.8) as soon as possible.
  See [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.

  ### Workarounds
  It is possible to restrict access to the affected API (e.g. in the webserver config) which is most likely unused anyway and thus will not break anything.
