aliases:
  - CVE-2020-25016
summary: |
  Out of bounds access in rgb
  Affected versions of rgb crate allow viewing and modifying data of any type T wrapped in RGB<T> as bytes, and do not correctly constrain RGB<T> and other wrapper structures to the types for which it is safe to do so.

  Safety violation possible for a type wrapped in RGB<T> and similar wrapper structures:

  * If T contains padding, viewing it as bytes may lead to exposure of contents of uninitialized memory.
  * If T contains a pointer, modifying it as bytes may lead to dereferencing of arbitrary pointers.
  * Any safety and/or validity invariants for T may be violated.

  The issue was resolved by requiring all types wrapped in structures provided by RGB crate to implement an unsafe marker trait.
