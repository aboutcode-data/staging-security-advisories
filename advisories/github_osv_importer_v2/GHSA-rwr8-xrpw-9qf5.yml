  solspace/craft-freeform Exposed to Known Axios Vulnerabilities via Precompiled Assets
  ### Summary
  The latest versions of both 4.x and 5.x are using Axios versions < 1.7.5 and as such are subject to known vulnerabilities as per: https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/axios

  ### Details
  We've had this flagged up in a pen test, which indicates the issue stems from this script: /freeform/plugin.js. I couldn't see any reference to vulnerable axios versions in your package.json files, but noticed some precompiled files in packages/plugin so I'm assuming those are where the issue lies.
