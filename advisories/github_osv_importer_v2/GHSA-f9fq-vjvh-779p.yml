summary: |
  Improper Input Validation in vault-ssh-helper
  HashiCorp vault-ssh-helper (github.com/hashicorp/vault-ssh-helper/helper) up to and including version 0.1.6 incorrectly accepted Vault-issued SSH OTPs for the subnet in which a host's network interface was located, rather than the specific IP address assigned to that interface. Fixed in 0.2.0.
