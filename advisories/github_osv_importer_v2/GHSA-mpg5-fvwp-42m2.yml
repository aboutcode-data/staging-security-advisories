  Unsoundness in `dashmap` references
  Reference returned by some methods of `Ref` (and similar types) may outlive the `Ref` and escape the lock.
  This causes undefined behavior and may result in a segfault.

  More information in [`dashmap#167`](https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap/issues/167) issue.
