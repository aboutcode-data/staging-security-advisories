summary: "Vendure asset server plugin has local file read vulnerability with AssetServerPlugin\
  \ & LocalAssetStorageStrategy\n# Description\n\n## Path traversal\n\nThis vulnerability allows\
  \ an attacker to craft a request which is able to traverse the server file system and retrieve\
  \ the contents of arbitrary files, including sensitive data such as configuration files, environment\
  \ variables, and other critical data stored on the server.\n\nFrom Rajesh Sharma who discovered\
  \ the vulnerability:\n\nPOC: `curl --path-as-is http://localhost:3000/assets/../package.json`\
  \ gives you the content of package.json present in the local directory.\n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ stems from usage of decodedReqPath directly in path.join without performing any path normalization\
  \ i.e path.normalize in node.js\n\nhttps://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/blob/801980e8f599c28c5059657a9d85dd03e3827992/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts#L352-L358\n\
  \nIf the vendure service is behind some server like nginx, apache, etc. Path normalization\
  \ is performed on the root server level but still the actual client's request path will be\
  \ sent to vendure service but not the resultant normalized path. However, depending the type\
  \ of root server one can try various payloads to bypass such normalization. \n\nThe reporter\
  \ found a customer website which uses local asset plugin and using above mentioned vulnerability,\
  \ and was able to find secrets like email credentials.\n\n\n## DOS via malformed URI\n\nIn\
  \ the same code path is an additional vector for crashing the server via a malformed URI\n\
  \nAgain from Rajesh:\n\nThere is also a potential Denial of Service (DoS) issue when incorrectly\
  \ encoded URI characters are passed as part of the asset URL. When these malformed requests\
  \ are processed, they can lead to system crashes or resource exhaustion, rendering the service\
  \ unavailable to users.\nExploit: `curl  --path-as-is http://localhost:3000/assets/%80package.json`\
  \ , here `%80` is not a valid url-encoded character hence the decodeURIComponent is called\
  \ on it, the entire app crashes. \n\n```\n[:server] /Users/abc/mywork/vendure/packages/asset-server-plugin/src/plugin.ts:353\n\
  [:server]         const decodedReqPath = decodeURIComponent(req.path);\n[:server]        \
  \                        ^\n[:server] URIError: URI malformed\n```\n\n### Patches\nv3.0.5,\
  \ v2.3.3\n\n### Workarounds\n- Use object storage rather than the local file system, e.g.\
  \ MinIO or S3\n- Define middleware which detects and blocks requests with urls containing\
  \ `/../`"
