  - CVE-2021-41106
summary: |
  File reference keys leads to incorrect hashes on HMAC algorithms
  ### Impact

  Users of HMAC-based algorithms (HS256, HS384, and HS512) combined with `Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\LocalFileReference` as key are having their tokens issued/validated using the file path as hashing key - instead of the contents.

  The HMAC hashing functions take any string as input and, since users can issue and validate tokens, people are lead to believe that everything works properly.

  ### Patches

  All versions have been patched to always load the file contents, deprecated the `Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\LocalFileReference`, and suggest `Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\InMemory` as the alternative.

  ### Workarounds

  Use `Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\InMemory` instead of `Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\LocalFileReference` to create the instances of your keys:

  ```diff
  -use Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\LocalFileReference;
  +use Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\InMemory;

  -$key = LocalFileReference::file(__DIR__ . '/public-key.pem');
  +$key = InMemory::file(__DIR__ . '/public-key.pem');
  ```
