  - CVE-2023-49797
summary: |
  Local Privilege Escalation in Windows
  ### Impact

  A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to.

  A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied:

  * The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`.
  * The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker).
  * The user's temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location).
  * Either:
    - The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between [`shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0fb18b02c8ad56299d6a2910be0bab8ad601ef24/Lib/shutil.py#L623) and the deletion itself
    - The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been addressed in https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/pull/7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller >= 5.13.1`

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  No workaround, although the attack complexity becomes much higher if the application is built with Python >= 3.8.0.
