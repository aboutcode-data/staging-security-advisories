summary: |
  Strapi Password Hashing is Missing Maximum Password Length Validation
  ## Summary

  Strapi's password hashing implementation using bcryptjs lacks maximum password length validation. Since bcryptjs truncates passwords exceeding 72 bytes, this creates potential vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass and performance degradation.

  ## POC
  Create an admin user with a password exceeding 72 characters like 85,
  Log in using only the first 72 characters of the password.
  Authentication is successful, confirming the issue.

  Proposed Solution Based on  discussions:

  Add a maximum password length validation (72 characters) during password creation and updates for both Admin and U&P users.
  Truncate passwords exceeding 72 bytes on the server before passing them to bcryptjs during login.
  Optionally, issue a warning to users with passwords longer than 72 bytes during login, informing them of truncation.

  ## Impact
  This issue affects all Strapi installations using bcryptjs for password hashing. Until resolved, it can lead to:
  Authentication Bypass: Users may unknowingly set passwords exceeding 72 bytes, leading to truncated, predictable hashes.
  Performance Issues: Excessively long passwords can degrade server performance.
