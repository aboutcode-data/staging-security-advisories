  Denial of Service in mongodb
  Versions of `mongodb` prior to 3.1.13 are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The package fails to properly catch an exception when a collection name is invalid and the DB does not exist, crashing the application.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 3.1.13 or later.
