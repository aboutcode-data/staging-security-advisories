  Cross-Site Scripting in swagger-ui
  Versions of `swagger-ui` prior to 2.2.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to sanitize JSON schemas, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript using `<script>` tags in the method descriptions.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.2.1 or later.
