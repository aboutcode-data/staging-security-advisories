aliases:
  - CVE-2025-21612
summary: |
  Extension:TabberNeue vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
  ### Summary
  There are several sources of arbitrary, unescaped user input being used to construct HTML, which allows any user that can edit pages or otherwise render wikitext to XSS other users.

  > Edit: Only the first XSS can be reproduced in production.

  ### Details

  > ✅ Verified and patched in f229cab099c69006e25d4bad3579954e481dc566

  https://github.com/StarCitizenTools/mediawiki-extensions-TabberNeue/blob/2526daa9f8cfdd616c861c8439755cb74a6c8c6e/includes/TabberTransclude.php#L154
  This doesn't escape the user-supplied page name when outputting, so an XSS payload as the page name can be used here.

  This was caused by d8c3db4e5935476e496d979fb01f775d3d3282e6.

  > ❌ Invalid as MediaWiki parser sanitizes dangerous HTML

  https://github.com/StarCitizenTools/mediawiki-extensions-TabberNeue/blob/2526daa9f8cfdd616c861c8439755cb74a6c8c6e/includes/Tabber.php#L160
  The documentation for [`Parser::recursiveTagParse()`](https://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/REL1_42/php/classMediaWiki_1_1Parser_1_1Parser.html#ae450036ec9abb417f142bfdaede02783) states that it returns unsafe HTML, and the `$content` being supplied is from user input.

  This was caused by 95351812613e04717f3ad7844cfcc67e4ede4d11.

  > ❌ Invalid as TabberParsoid is not being used

  https://github.com/StarCitizenTools/mediawiki-extensions-TabberNeue/blob/2526daa9f8cfdd616c861c8439755cb74a6c8c6e/includes/TabberParsoid.php#L96
  This uses unescaped user input as the attribute of an element, thus allowing the user to break out of the attribute or element and injecting arbitrary attributes to the element, or inserting new ones (such as a script tag).

  This was caused by 8278e665480f08da635aee383c6b5caaeca26ba3.

  ### PoC
  For the first XSS, render the following wikitext (whether it be through saving it to a page and viewing it, or via Special:ExpandTemplates):
  ```wikitext
  <tabbertransclude>
  <script>alert(1)</script> | hehe
  </tabbertransclude>
  ```
  ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079365a9-203d-4758-a5a4-2166f9a32e62)

  For the second XSS, I have given up attempting to reproduce it after over twenty minutes of "surfing through the internals of the MediaWiki parser fishing for an XSS out of this giant contraption as I bring myself deeper and deeper into the cogs of the machine that no one knows how to maintain or fully operate ever since its conception".

  For the third XSS, this is unreachable as the class is never used, though it should be fixed anyway (or the file removed).

  ### Impact
  Any user with the ability to cause another user to render wikitext (such as viewing a page that the user can edit, or an attacker tricking the victim to click on a link to Special:ExpandTemplates with the malicious wikitext in the `wpInput` parameter) can XSS said user.
