aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15185
summary: |
  Repository index file allows for duplicates of the same chart entry in helm
  ### Impact

  During a security audit of Helm's code base, security researchers at Trail of Bits identified a bug in which the a Helm repository can contain duplicates of the same chart, with the last one always used. If a repository is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository.

  To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the index file (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection).

  ### Specific Go Packages Affected
  helm.sh/helm/v3/pkg/repo

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11

  ### Workarounds

  - do not install charts from repositories you do not trust
  - fetch charts using a secure channel of communication (such as TLS)
  - use `helm pull` to fetch the chart, then review the chart’s content (either manually, or with `helm verify` if it has been signed) to ensure it has not been tampered with
  - manually review the index file in the Helm repository cache before installing software.
