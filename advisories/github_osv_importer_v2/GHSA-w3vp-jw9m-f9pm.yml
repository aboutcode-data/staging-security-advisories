summary: |
  Unbounded queuing of path validation messages in cloudflare-quiche
  ### Impact
  quiche v. 0.15.0 through 0.19.0 was discovered to be vulnerable to unbounded queuing of path validation messages, which could lead to excessive resource consumption.

  QUIC path validation ([RFC 9000 Section 8.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8.2)) requires that the recipient of a PATH_CHALLENGE frame responds by sending a PATH_RESPONSE. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be sent at the slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of path validation data in an unbounded queue.

  ### Patches
  Quiche versions greater than 0.19.0 address this problem.
