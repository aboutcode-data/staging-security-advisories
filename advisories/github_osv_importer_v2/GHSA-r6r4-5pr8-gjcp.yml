  - CVE-2024-21631
summary: "Vapor contains an integer overflow in URI leading to potential host spoofing\nVapor's\
  \ `vapor_urlparser_parse` function uses `uint16_t` indexes when parsing a URI's components,\
  \ which may cause integer overflows when parsing untrusted inputs.\n\nThis vulnerability does\
  \ not affect Vapor directly but could impact applications relying on the URI type for validating\
  \ user input. \n\nThe URI type is used in several places in Vapor. A developer may decide\
  \ to use URI to represent a URL in their application (especially if that URL is then passed\
  \ to the HTTP Client) and rely on its public properties and methods. However, URI may fail\
  \ to properly parse a valid (albeit abnormally long) URL, due to string ranges being converted\
  \ to 16-bit integers. An attacker may use this behaviour to trick the application into accepting\
  \ a URL to an untrusted destination.\n\nBy padding the port number with zeros, an attacker\
  \ can cause an integer overflow to occur when the URL authority is parsed and, as a result,\
  \ spoof the host.\n\n### Impact\nUsers attempting to treat untrusted input as a URI are vulnerable\
  \ to a host spoofing attack due to an integer overflow.\n\n### Workarounds\nValidate user\
  \ input before parsing as a URI or, if possible, use Foundation's `URL` and `URLComponents`\
  \ utilities."
