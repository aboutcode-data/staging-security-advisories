summary: |
  Potential access control security issue in apollo-adminservice
  ### Impact
  If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesn't have built-in access control. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations.

  ### Patches
  Access control for admin service was added in #3233 and was released in [v1.7.1](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/releases/tag/v1.7.1).

  ### Workarounds
  To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.

  ### Credits
  [Lexu](https://github.com/lllllx) reported the issue and provided the required information to reproduce it.
