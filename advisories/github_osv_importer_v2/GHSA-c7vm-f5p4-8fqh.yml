aliases:
  - CVE-2020-26215
summary: |
  Open redirect in Jupyter Notebook
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Open redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to a different website.

  All notebook servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known notebook server hosts. A link to your notebook server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.

  ### Patches

  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Patched in notebook 6.1.5
