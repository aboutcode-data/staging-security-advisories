summary: "Eclipse Jetty XmlParser allows arbitrary DOCTYPE declarations\n### From the reporter\n\
  \n> `XmlParser` is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability.\n>  XmlParser is\
  \ being used when parsing Jetty’s xml configuration files. An attacker might exploit\n> this\
  \ vulnerability in order to achieve SSRF or cause a denial of service.\n> One possible scenario\
  \ is importing a (remote) malicious WAR into a Jetty’s server, while the\n> WAR includes a\
  \ malicious web.xml.\n\n### Impact\nThere are no circumstances in a normally deployed Jetty\
  \ server where potentially hostile XML is given to the XmlParser class without the attacker\
  \ already having arbitrary access to the server. I.e. in order to exploit `XmlParser` the\
  \ attacker would already have the ability to deploy and execute hostile code.  Specifically,\
  \ Jetty has no protection against malicious web application and potentially hostile web applications\
  \ should only be run on an isolated virtualisation.  \n\nThus this is not considered a vulnerability\
  \ of the Jetty server itself, as any such usage of the jetty XmlParser is equally vulnerable\
  \ as a direct usage of the JVM supplied SAX parser.  No CVE will be allocated to this advisory.\n\
  \nHowever, any direct usage of the `XmlParser` class by an application may be vulnerable.\
  \  The impact would greatly depend on how the application uses `XmlParser`, but it could be\
  \ a denial of service due to large entity expansion, or possibly the revealing local files\
  \ if the XML results are accessible remotely.\n\n### Patches\nAbility to configure the SAXParserFactory\
  \ to fit the needs of your particular XML parser implementation have been merged as part of\
  \ PR #10067\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use Jetty's `XmlParser` to parse data from users."
