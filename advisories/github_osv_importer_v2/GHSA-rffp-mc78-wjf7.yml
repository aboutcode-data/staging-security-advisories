  Command Injection in cocos-utils
  All versions of `cocos-utils` are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The `unzip()` function concatenates user input to `exec()` which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands  on the server.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
