  Cross-Site Scripting in eco
  All versions of  `eco` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package's default `__escape` implementation fails to escape single quotes, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the victim's browser.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
