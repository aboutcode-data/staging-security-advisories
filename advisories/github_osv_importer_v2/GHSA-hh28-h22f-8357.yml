  - CVE-2025-54999
summary: "OpenBao has a Timing Side-Channel in the Userpass Auth Method\n### Impact\n\nWhen\
  \ using OpenBao's `userpass` auth method, user enumeration was possible due to timing difference\
  \ between non-existent users and users with stored credentials. This is independent of whether\
  \ the supplied credentials were valid for the given user. \n\n### Patches\n\nOpenBao v2.3.2\
  \ will patch this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may use another auth method or apply\
  \ rate limiting quotas to limit the number of requests in a period of time: https://openbao.org/api-docs/system/rate-limit-quotas/\n\
  \n### References\n\nThis issue was disclosed to HashiCorp and is the OpenBao equivalent of\
  \ the following tickets:\n\n- https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-15-timing-side-channel-in-vault-s-userpass-auth-method/76034\n\
  - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6011\n\nBarring further information, this is also\
  \ assumed to cover and remediate the following additional vulnerability:\n\n- https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-21-vault-user-enumeration-in-userpass-auth-method/76095\n\
  - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6010\n\nIf this is not the case as further details\
  \ emerge, a new CVE will be assigned for remediating that. Otherwise, no further CVE will\
  \ be sought."
