summary: |
  Apache Superset allows authenticated users to discover metadata about datasources they don't have permission to access
  Apache Superset contains an improper access control vulnerability in its /explore endpoint. A missing authorization check allows an authenticated user to discover metadata about datasources they do not have permission to access. By iterating through the datasource_id in the URL, an attacker can enumerate and confirm the existence and names of protected datasources, leading to sensitive information disclosure.

  This issue affects Apache Superset: before 5.0.0.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 5.0.0, which fixes the issue.
