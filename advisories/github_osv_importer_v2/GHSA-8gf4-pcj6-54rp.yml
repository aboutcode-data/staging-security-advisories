  - CVE-2016-10611
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in strider-sauce\nAffected versions of `strider-sauce`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `strider-sauce`.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nWhile the package author has created\
  \ a patch for this vulnerability, they have not yet published it to npm or bumped the version\
  \ number.\n\nIn order to resolve the vulnerability, you will need to install the module manually\
  \ from github:\n```\nnpm install github:Strider-CD/strider-sauce#5ff6d65\n```\n\nAs this vulnerability\
  \ does not have a version bump included with the patch, it is possible that you have received\
  \ a report for a vulnerable package, yet have installed the patched version and are no longer\
  \ vulnerable. If that is the case, this advisory can be disregarded."
