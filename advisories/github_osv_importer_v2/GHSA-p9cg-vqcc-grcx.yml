summary: "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack in Fedify\n### Summary\n \nAt present, when\
  \ Fedify needs to retrieve an object or activity from a remote activitypub server, it makes\
  \ a HTTP request to the `@id` or other resources present within the activity it has received\
  \ from the web. This activity could reference an `@id` that points to an internal IP address,\
  \ allowing an attacker to send request to resources internal to the fedify server's network.\n\
  \nThis applies to not just resolution of documents containing activities or objects, but also\
  \ to media URLs as well.\n\nSpecifically this is a [Server Side Request Forgery attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery).\
  \ You can learn more about SSRF attacks via [CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)\n\
  \n### Details\n\nWhen Fedify makes a request at runtime via the DocLoader [1] [2], the `fetch`\
  \ API does not first check the URI's to assert that it resolve to a public IP address. Additionally,\
  \ any downstream software of Fedify that may fetch data from URIs contained within Activities\
  \ or Objects maybe be at risk of requesting non-public resources, and storing those, exposing\
  \ non-public information to the public.\n\nAdditionally, in many cases the URIs are not asserted\
  \ to be either strictly HTTPS or HTTP protocols, which could lead to further attacks, and\
  \ there is no check that the URI contains a `hostname` part. Whilst the [`fetch()` specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/)\
  \ may provide some safety here, along with underlying fetch implementations, there is still\
  \ potential for attacks through using `data:` URIs, or just attacking some other protocol\
  \ entirely, e.g., FTP or CalDav.\n\n[1] https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/runtime/docloader.ts#L141\n\
  [2] https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/runtime/docloader.ts#L175\n\n#### Deno-specific\
  \ Attack Vectors\n\nIn Deno specifically, the `fetch()` API allows [accessing local filesystem](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/api/runtime-fetch/),\
  \ I'm not sure how Deno's [Permissions model](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/runtime/permission_apis/)\
  \ may prevent attacks utilising `file:` URIs.\n \n> Fetch also supports fetching from file\
  \ URLs to retrieve static files. For more info on static files, see the [filesystem API documentation](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/api/runtime-fs).\n\
  \n#### ActivityPub Security Considerations\n\nThis is also noted in the ActivityPub spec in\
  \ [Section B.3 Security Considerations](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#security-localhost),\
  \ however, there it is more limited in scope.\n\n#### Other Implementations\n\nIt may be acceptable\
  \ to allow a server operator to allow access to given non-public IP addresses, for instance\
  \ [in Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/092bb8a27af9ee87ff9ebabaf354477470ea3a94/app/lib/request.rb#L330)\
  \ they allow requests to non-public IP addresses, i.e., localhost in development and those\
  \ in the `ALLOWED_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES` environment variable.\n\n### PoC\n\nI'm not sure a PoC\
  \ is necessary given this is a reasonably well known vulnerability vector.\n\n### Impact\n\
  \nThis impacts server operates, as resources that are internal to their network may find themselves\
  \ being improperly accessed or potentially even attacked or exposed to the public.\n\n###\
  \ Notes for resolution:\n\nWhen implementing public IP address validation, be careful of [CWE-1389](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1389.html)\
  \ and [CWE-1286](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1286.html) both of which [recently](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-78xj-cgh5-2h22)\
  \ caused a CVE to be filed against the popular node.js `ip` package, although this package\
  \ was not originally intended for security purposes."
