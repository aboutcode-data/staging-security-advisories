  Cross-Site Scripting in dmn-js-properties-panel
  Versions of `dmn-js-properties-panel` prior to 0.8.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to sanitize input in specially configured diagrams, which may allow attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the embedding website.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 0.3.0 or later.
