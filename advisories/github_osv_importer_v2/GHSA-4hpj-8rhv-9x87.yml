  - CVE-2023-36814
summary: |
  Products.CMFCore unauthenticated denial of service and crash via unchecked use of input with Python's marshal module
  ### Impact
  The use of Python's marshal module to handle unchecked input in a public method on `PortalFolder` objects can lead to an unauthenticated denial of service and crash situation. The code in question is exposed by all portal software built on top of `Products.CMFCore`, such as Plone. All deployments are vulnerable.

  ### Patches
  The code has been fixed in `Products.CMFCore` version 3.2.

  ### Workarounds
  Users can make the affected `decodeFolderFilter` method unreachable by editing the `PortalFolder.py` module in `Products.CMFCore` by hand and then restarting Zope. Go to line 233 of `PortalFolder.py` and remove both the `@security.public` decorator for `decodeFolderFilter` as well as the method's entire docstring. This is safe because the method is not actually used by current code.
