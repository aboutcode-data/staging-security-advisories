summary: "Missing server signature validation in OctoberCMS\n### Impact\n\nThis advisory affects\
  \ authors of plugins and themes listed on the October CMS marketplace where an end-user will\
  \ inadvertently expose authors to potential financial loss by entering their private license\
  \ key into a compromised server.\n\nIt has been disclosed that a project fork of October CMS\
  \ v1.0 is using a compromised gateway to access the October CMS marketplace service. The compromised\
  \ gateway captures the personal/business information of users and authors, including private\
  \ source code files. It was also disclosed that captured plugin files are freely redistributed\
  \ to other users without authorization.\n\n1. End-users are provided with a forked version\
  \ of October CMS v1.0. The provided software is modified to use a compromised gateway server.\n\
  \n2. The user is instructed to enter their October CMS license key into the administration\
  \ panel to access the October CMS marketplace. The key is sent to the compromised server while\
  \ appearing to access the genuine October CMS gateway server.\n\n3. The compromised gateway\
  \ server uses a \"man in the middle\" mechanism that captures information while forwarding\
  \ the request to the genuine October CMS gateway and relaying the response back to the client.\n\
  \n4. The compromised gateway server stores the license key and other information about the\
  \ user account including client name, email address and contents of purchased plugins and\
  \ privately uploaded plugin files. \n\n5. The stored plugin files are made available to other\
  \ users of the compromised gateway server.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in\
  \ Build 475 (v1.0.475) and v1.1.11.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/e3b455ad587282f0fbcb7763c6d9c3d000ca1e6a\
  \ to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 475 or v1.1.11.\n\n### Recommendations\n\
  \nWe recommend the following steps to make sure your account information stays secure:\n\n\
  - Do not share your license key with anyone except October CMS.\n- Check to make sure that\
  \ your gateway update server has not been modified.\n- Be aware of phishing websites, including\
  \ other platforms that use the same appearance.\n- For authors, you may contact us for help\
  \ requesting the removal of affected plugins.\n- Before providing plugin support, verify that\
  \ the user holds a legitimate copy of the plugin.\n\n### References\n\nCredits for research\
  \ on this exploit:\n• Nikita Khaetsky\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions\
  \ or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)"
