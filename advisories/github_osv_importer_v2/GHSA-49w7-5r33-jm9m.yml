  - CVE-2024-25712
summary: |
  http-swagger XSS via PUT requests
  http-swagger before 1.2.6 allows XSS via PUT requests, because a file that has been uploaded (via httpSwagger.WrapHandler and *webdav.memFile) can subsequently be accessed via a GET request. NOTE: this is independently fixable with respect to CVE-2022-24863, because (if a solution continued to allow PUT requests) large files could have been blocked without blocking JavaScript, or JavaScript could have been blocked without blocking large files.
