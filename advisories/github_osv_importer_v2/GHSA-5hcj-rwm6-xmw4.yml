summary: |
  biscuit-java vulnerable to public key confusion in third party block
  ### Impact
  Tokens with third-party blocks containing trusted annotations generated through a third party block request. Due to implementation issues in biscuit-java,  third party block support in published versions is inoperating. Nevertheless, to synchronize with other implementations, we publish this advisory and the related fix.

  ### Description
  Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it:

  the public key of the previous block (used in the signature)
  the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions)
  A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.

  Consider the following example (nominal case)
  * Authority A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty("b") trusting ${pubkeyB}`
  * The well-behaving holder then generates a third-party block request based on the token and sends it to third-party authority B
  * Third-party B generates the following third-party block `thirdparty("b"); check if thirdparty("c") trusting ${pubkeyC}`
  * The token holder now must obtain a third-party block from third party C to be able to use the token

  Now, with a malicious user:
  * Authority A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty("b") trusting ${pubkeyB}`
  * The holder then attenuates the token with the following third party block `thirdparty("c")`, signed with a keypair pubkeyD, privkeyD) they generate
  * The holder then generates a third-party block request based on this token, but alter the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` publicKeys field and replace pubkeyD with pubkeyC
  * Third-party B generates the following third-party block `thirdparty("b"); check if thirdparty("c") trusting ${pubkeyC}`
  * Due to the altered symbol table, the actual meaning of the block is `thirdparty("b"); check if thirdparty("c") trusting ${pubkeyD}`
  * The attacker can now use the token without obtaining a third-party block from C.
