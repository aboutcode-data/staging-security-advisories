summary: "Unbounded connection acceptance in http4s-blaze-server\n### Impact\n\nblaze-core,\
  \ a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly on its selector\
  \ pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle\
  \ their current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted and added to an\
  \ unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource.\
  \ This can also confound higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed\
  \ connections.\n\nhttp4s provides a general `MaxActiveRequests` middleware mechanism for limiting\
  \ open connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection\
  \ is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections\
  \ which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be held open.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nIn 0.21.18, 0.22.0-M3, and 1.0.0-M16, a new`maxConnections` property, with\
  \ a default value of 1024, has been added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`.  Setting the value\
  \ to a negative number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended.  \n\n\
  The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`.  Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21,\
  \ and the option is removed altogether starting in http4s-0.22.\n\nThe connections are bounded\
  \ in 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, but the `maxConnections` parameter was passed incorrectly,\
  \ making it impossible to change the Blaze default of 512. \n\n### Workarounds\n* An Nginx\
  \ side-car acting as a reverse proxy for the local http4s-blaze-server instance would be able\
  \ to apply a connection limiting semantic before the sockets reach blaze-core. Nginx’s connection\
  \ bounding is both asynchronous and properly respects backpressure.\n* http4s-ember-server\
  \ is an alternative to http4s-blaze-server, but does not yet have HTTP/2 or web socket support.\
  \  Its performance in terms of RPS is appreciably behind Blaze’s, and as the newest backend,\
  \ has substantially less industrial uptake.\n* http4s-jetty is an alternative to http4s-blaze-server,\
  \ but does not yet have web socket support.  Its performance in terms of requests per second\
  \ is somewhat behind Blaze’s, and despite Jetty's industrial adoption, the http4s integration\
  \ has substantially less industrial uptake.\n* http4s-tomcat is an alternative to http4s-blaze-server,\
  \ but does not yet have HTTP/2 web socket support.  Its performance in terms of requests per\
  \ second is somewhat behind Blaze’s, and despite Jetty's industrial adoption, the http4s integration\
  \ has substantially less industrial uptake.\n\n### References\n\nSee [the Blaze GHSA](https://github.com/http4s/blaze/security/advisories/GHSA-xmw9-q7x9-j5qc)\
