aliases:
  - CVE-2023-6551
summary: "class.upload.php allows cross-site scripting attacks via uploaded files\nAs a simple\
  \ library, class.upload.php does not perform an in-depth check on uploaded files, allowing\
  \ a stored XSS vulnerability when the default configuration is used. \n\n\nDevelopers must\
  \ be aware of that fact and use extension whitelisting accompanied by forcing the server to\
  \ always provide content-type based on the file extension. \n\n\nThe README has been updated\
  \ to include these guidelines."
