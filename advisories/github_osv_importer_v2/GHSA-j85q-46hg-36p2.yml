summary: |
  SpiceDB: LookupSubjects may return partial results if a specific kind of relation is used
  ### Background

  Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder->view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for *either* `folder` or `folder#parent`.

  This bug *only* manifests if the *same* subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types *and* an arrow is used over the relation.

  ### Impact

  Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected.

  ### Workarounds
  Avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.
