summary: |
  # Withdrawn

  This advisory was initially published and mapped incorrectly to nuget `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref`. We later reanalyzed this advisory and found it does not have a direct mapping to a NuGet package.  Thus we have withdrawn this advisory.

  The underlying ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability and CVE-2021-31957 remain legitimate.

  # Description.

  Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 3.1. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.

  A denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles client disconnect. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.


  ### Patches

  * If you're using .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.16 or SDK 3.1.116 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.410 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.
