summary: "Regular Expression Denial of Service in bleach\nAll versions of the `bleach` package\
  \ are vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service attack when certain types of input\
  \ are passed into the sanitize function.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe `bleach` package\
  \ is not currently maintained, and has not seen an update since 2014. \n\nTo mitigate this\
  \ issue, it is necessary to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and provides\
  \ similar functionality. There are [multiple modules fitting this criteria available on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=html%20sanitizer&page=1&ranking=optimal)."
