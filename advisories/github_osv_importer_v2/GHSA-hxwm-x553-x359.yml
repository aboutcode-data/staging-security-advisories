summary: "Arbitrary Command Injection due to Improper Command Sanitization\n### Summary\nThere\
  \ exists a command injection vulnerability in `npmcli/git` versions <2.0.8 which may result\
  \ in arbitrary shell command execution due to improper argument sanitization when `npmcli/git`\
  \ is used to execute Git commands based on user controlled input. \n\nThe impact of this issue\
  \ is possible Arbitrary Command Injection when `npmcli/git` is run with untrusted (user controlled)\
  \ Git command arguments. \n\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary Command Injection\n\n### Details\n\n\
  `npmcli/git` prior to release `2.0.8` passed user controlled input as arguments to a shell\
  \ command without properly sanitizing this input. Passing unsanitized input to a shell can\
  \ lead to arbitrary command injection. For example passing `git+https://github.com/npm/git;\
  \ echo hello world` would trigger the shell execution of `echo hello world`.  \n\nThis issue\
  \ was remediated by no longer running `npmcli/git` git commands through an intermediate shell.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in release `2.0.8`\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n\
  This report was reported to us by @tyage (Ierae Security) through the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com)."
