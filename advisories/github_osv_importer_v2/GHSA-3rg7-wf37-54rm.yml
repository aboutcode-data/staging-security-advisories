summary: |
  Symfony's incorrect parsing of PATH_INFO can lead to limited authorization bypass
  ### Description

  The `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`. This can allow bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix assumption.

  ### Resolution

  The `Request` class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`.

  The patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/9962b91b12bb791322fa73836b350836b6db7cac) for branch 5.4.

  ### Credits

  We would like to thank Andrew Atkinson for discovering the issue, Chris Smith for reporting it and Nicolas Grekas for providing the fix.
