  Silverstripe XSS In GridField print
  A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the print view of  GridField.

  This vulnerability can only be exploited if a user with CMS access has posted malicious or unescaped HTML into any field of an object in a GridField, and the print feature is used.

  This has been resolved by ensuring that the print feature safely escapes all fields.
