  Cookie leakage between different users in fastapi-proxy-lib
  ### Impact

  In the implementation of version `0.0.1`, requests from different user clients are processed using a shared `httpx.AsyncClient`.

  However, one oversight is that the `httpx.AsyncClient` will persistently store cookies based on the `set-cookie` response header sent by the target server and share these cookies across different user requests.

  This results in a cookie leakage issue among all user clients sharing the same `httpx.AsyncClient`.

  ### Patches

  It's fixed in `0.1.0`

  ### Workarounds

  If you insist `0.0.1`:
  - Do not use `ForwardHttpProxy` at all.
  - Do not use `ReverseHttpProxy` or `ReverseWebSocketProxy` for any servers that may potentially send a `set-cookie` response.

  **However, it's best to upgrade to the latest version.**
