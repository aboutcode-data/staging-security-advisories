  \ has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the responses and replace\
  \ the dependencies with malicious ones, resulting in code execution on the system running\
  \ `hubl-server`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability,\
  \ and it has not seen any updates since 2015.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid\
  \ using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk\
  \ of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected\
  \ to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who\
  \ can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised yo"
