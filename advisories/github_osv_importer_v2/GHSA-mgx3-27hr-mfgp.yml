summary: |
  HTTParty does not restrict casts of string values
  The httparty gem 0.9.0 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for YAML type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
