summary: "Harbor is vulnerable to a limited Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CVE-2020-13788)\n\
  # Impact\nMatt Hamilton from Soluble has discovered a limited Server-Side Request Forgery\
  \ (SSRF) that allowed Harbor project owners to scan the TCP ports of hosts on the Harbor server's\
  \ internal network. \n\nThe vulnerability was immediately fixed by the Harbor team.  \n\n\
  # Issue \nThe “Test Endpoint” API, part of the functionality for ensuring a project Webhook\
  \ is accessible and functional, is vulnerable to a limited SSRF attack. A malicious user that\
  \ is also a project administrator can use this API for internal port scanning.\n\n# Known\
  \ Attack Vectors\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue will lead to bad actors identifying\
  \ open TCP ports on any network that is accessible by the Harbor core services\n\n# Patches\n\
  If your product uses the affected releases of Harbor, update to version 2.0.1 to patch this\
  \ issue immediately.\n\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.0.1\n\n# Workarounds\n\
  Since only project administrators (the user that created the project) are allowed to test\
  \ the webhook endpoints configured in Harbor, a Harbor system administrator can control who\
  \ is a project admin. In addition, Harbor system administrators can enforce a setting where\
  \ only an administrator is allowed to create new projects instead of the default Everyone.\
  \ This further restricts who can be a project administrator in Harbor.\n\n# For more information\n\
