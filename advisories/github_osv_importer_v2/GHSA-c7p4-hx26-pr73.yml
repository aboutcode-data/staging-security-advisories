  - CVE-2025-54887
summary: |
  JWE is missing AES-GCM authentication tag validation in encrypted JWE
  ### Overview
  The authentication tag of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced, which may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs.

  ### Impact
  - JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value
  - JWEs can be decrypted by observing parsing differences
  - The GCM internal [GHASH key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode#:~:text=\)%20is%20the-,hash%20key,-%2C%20a%20string%20of) can be recovered


  ### Am I Affected?
  You are affected by this vulnerability even if you do not use an `AES-GCM` encryption algorithm for your JWEs.

  ### Patches
  The version 1.1.1 fixes the issue by adding the tag length check for the `AES-GCM` algorithm.

  **Important:** As the [GHASH key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode#:~:text=\)%20is%20the-,hash%20key,-%2C%20a%20string%20of) could have leaked, you must rotate the encryption keys after upgrading to version 1.1.1.
