  Holder can (re)create authentic credentials after receiving a credential in vp-toolkit
  ### Impact
  The [`verifyVerifiableCredential()`](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit/blob/master/src/service/signers/verifiable-credential-signer.ts#L57) method check the cryptographic integrity of the Verifiable Credential, but it does not check if the [`credential.issuer`](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit-models/blob/develop/src/model/verifiable-credential.ts#L129) DID matches the signer of the credential.

  The **verifier** is impacted by this vulnerability.

  ### Patches
  Patch will be available in version 0.2.2.

  ### Workarounds
  In case you trust certain issuers for certain credentials as a verifier, trust the issuer&#39;s public key from the `credential.proof.verificationMethod` field.
