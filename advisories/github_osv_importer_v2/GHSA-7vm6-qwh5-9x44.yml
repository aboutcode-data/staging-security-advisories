summary: "loona-hpack Panic Vulnerability\n### Summary\n`loona-hpack` suffers from the same\
  \ vulnerability as the original `hpack` as documented in https://github.com/mlalic/hpack-rs/issues/11\
  \ \n\n### Details\nThe original includes a very nice description of the problem, as well as\
  \ an easy-enough fix for it.\n\n### PoC\nThe original example pretty much still applies:\n\
  ```rust\nuse loona_hpack::Decoder;\n\npub fn main() {\n    let input = &[0x3f];\n    let mut\
  \ decoder = Decoder::new();\n    let _ = decoder.decode(input);\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\nFrom\
  \ the original:\n`All users who try to decode untrusted input using the Decoder are vulnerable\
  \ to this exploit. A patched version of the crate is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hpack-patched)\
  \ under the name hpack-patched. See [Cargo's documentation on overriding dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html)\
  \ for more information.`"
