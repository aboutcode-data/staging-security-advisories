aliases:
  - CVE-2022-25193
summary: |
  Jenkins Snow Commander Plugin prior to 2.0 vulnerable to Missing Authorization
  Snow Commander Plugin 1.10 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
