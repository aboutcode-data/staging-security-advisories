  - CVE-2022-28150
summary: |
  Cross site request forgery in Jenkins Job and Node ownership Plugin
  Job and Node ownership Plugin 0.13.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in several HTTP endpoints. This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to change the owners and item-specific permissions of a job. Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
