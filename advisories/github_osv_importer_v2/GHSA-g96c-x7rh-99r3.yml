summary: "Graylog vulnerable to insecure source port usage for DNS queries\n### Summary\nGraylog\
  \ utilises only one single source port for DNS queries.\n\n### Details\nGraylog seems to bind\
  \ a single socket for outgoing DNS queries. That socket is bound to a random port number which\
  \ is not changed again. This goes against recommended practice since 2008, when Dan Kaminsky\
  \ discovered how easy is to carry out DNS cache poisoning attacks. In order to prevent cache\
  \ poisoning with spoofed DNS responses, it is necessary to maximise the uncertainty in the\
  \ choice of a source port for a DNS query.\n\n\n### PoC \n\nThe attached figure shows the\
  \ source ports distribution difference between Graylog configured to use a data adapter based\
  \ on DNS queries and ISC Bind.  The source port distribution of the DNS queries sent from\
  \ Graylog to a recursive DNS name server running Bind (CLIENT_QUERY) are depicted in purple,\
  \ while the queries sent from the recursive DNS server to the authoritatives (RESOLVER_QUERY)\
  \ are plotted in green color. As it can be observed, in contrast to ISC Bind which presents\
  \ a heterogeneous usage of source port, Graylog utilises a single source port.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67056857/242301750-6a5a8d0d-fcd2-40d1-bbd4-73baa8279ed3.png)\n\
  \n### Impact\nAlthough unlikely in many setups, an external attacker could inject forged DNS\
  \ responses into a Graylog's lookup table cache. In order to prevent this, it is at least\
  \ recommendable to distribute the DNS queries through a pool of distinct sockets, each of\
  \ them with a random source port and renew them periodically.\n\n\n\n(Credit to Iratxe Niño\
