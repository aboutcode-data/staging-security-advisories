summary: "OpenSearch unauthorized data access on fields protected by field level security if\
  \ field is a member of an object\n### Impact\n\nOpenSearch versions 2.19.2 and earlier improperly\
  \ apply Field Level Security (FLS) rules on fields which are not at the top level of the source\
  \ document tree (i.e., which are members of a JSON object). \n\nIf an FLS exclusion rule (like\
  \ `~object`) is applied to an object valued attribute in a source document, the object is\
  \ properly removed from the `_source` document in search and get results. However, any member\
  \ attribute of that object remains available to search queries. This allows to reconstruct\
  \ the original field contents using range queries. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been resolved\
  \ in OpenSearch 3.0.0 and OpenSearch 2.19.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf FLS exclusion rules\
  \ are used for object valued attributes  (like `~object`), add an additional exclusion rule\
  \ for the members of the object  (like `~object.*`)."
