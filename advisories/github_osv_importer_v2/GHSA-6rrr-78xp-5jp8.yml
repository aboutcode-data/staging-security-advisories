summary: |
  Zitadel RefreshToken invalidation vulnerability
  ### Impact
  RefreshTokens is an OAuth 2.0 feature that allows applications to retrieve new access tokens and refresh the user's session without the need for interacting with a UI.

  RefreshTokens were not invalidated when a user was locked or deactivated. The deactivated or locked user was able to obtain a valid access token only through a refresh token grant.

  When the locked or deactivated user’s session was already terminated (“logged out”) then it was not possible to create a new session. Renewal of access token through a refresh token grant is limited to the configured amount of time (RefreshTokenExpiration).

  ### Patches
  2.x versions are fixed on >= [2.17.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.17.3)
  2.16.x versions are fixed on >= [2.16.4](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.16.4)

  ZITADEL recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course.

  ### Workarounds
  Ensure the RefreshTokenExpiration in the OIDC settings of your instance is set according to your security requirements.
