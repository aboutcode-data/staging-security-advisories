  - CVE-2016-10646
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in resourcehacker\nAffected versions of `resourcehacker`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `resourcehacker`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for\
  \ this vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using\
  \ a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced\
  \ by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the\
  \ package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability\
  \ are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your\
  \ ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
