  Cross-Site Scripting in jingo
  Versions of `jingo` prior to 1.9.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). If malicious input such as `<script>alert(1)</script>` is placed in the content of a wiki page, Jingo does not properly encode the input and it is executed instead of rendered as text.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.9.2
