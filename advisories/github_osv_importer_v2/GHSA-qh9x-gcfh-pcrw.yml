  - CVE-2022-31170
summary: |
  OpenZeppelin Contracts's ERC165Checker may revert instead of returning false
  ### Impact

  `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1.

  The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting.

  ### Patches

  The issue was patched in 4.7.1.
