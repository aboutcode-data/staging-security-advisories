summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in Jenkins
  Since Jenkins 2.340, the tooltip of the build button in list views supports HTML without escaping the job display name.

  This vulnerability is known to be exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

  Jenkins 2.356 addresses this vulnerability. The tooltip of the build button in list views is now escaped.

  No Jenkins LTS release is affected by SECURITY-2776 or SECURITY-2780, as these were not present in Jenkins 2.332.x and fixed in the 2.346.x line before 2.346.1.
