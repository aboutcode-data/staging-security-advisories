  - CVE-2022-41881
summary: |
  HAProxyMessageDecoder Stack Exhaustion DoS
  ### Impact
  A StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted message due to an infinite recursion.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to 4.1.86.Final.

  ### Workarounds
  There is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.

  ### References
  When parsing a TLV with type = PP2_TYPE_SSL, the value can be again a TLV with type = PP2_TYPE_SSL and so on.
  The only limitation of the recursion is that the TLV length cannot be bigger than 0xffff because it is encoded in an unsigned short type.
  Providing a TLV with a nesting level that is large enough will lead to raising of a StackOverflowError.
  The StackOverflowError will be caught if HAProxyMessageDecoder is used as part of Netty’s ChannelPipeline, but using it directly without the ChannelPipeline will lead to a thrown exception / crash.
