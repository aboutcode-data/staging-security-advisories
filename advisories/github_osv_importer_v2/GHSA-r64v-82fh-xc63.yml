summary: |
  Juju vulnerable to sensitive log retrieval via authenticated endpoint without authorization
  ### Impact
  Any user with a Juju account on a controller can read debug log messages from the `/log` endpoint.
  No specific permissions are required - it's just sufficient for the user to exist in the controller user database.
  The log messages may contain sensitive information.

  ### Details

  The `/log` endpoint is accessible at the following endpoints:
  - `wss://<controller-ip>/log`
  - `wss://<controller-ip>/model/<model-uuid>/log`

  In order to connect to these endpoints, the client must pass an X-Juju-Client-Version header that matches the current version and pass credentials in a Basic Authorization header. Once connected, the service will stream log events even though the user is not authorised to view them.

  To reproduce:

  ```
  juju bootstrap
  juju add-user testuser
  juju change-user-password testuser
  ```
  Run the [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) command below to
  connect to `wss://<controller-ip>:17070/api`. Update the JSON payload to include the username and password that were created above.

  ```
  wscat --no-check -c wss://contorller-ip:17070/model/modelUUID/api
  { "type": "Admin", "request": "Login", "version": 3, "params": { "client-
  version": "3.6.1.0", "auth-tag": "user-testuser", "credentials": "
  password" } }
  ```

  Observe that the connection fails due to a lack of permissions.

  Run the command below to connect to the log endpoint. Note that the credentials are passed in the --auth flag.

  ```
  wscat --auth user-testuser:password -H "X-Juju-ClientVersion: 3.6.4" --no-check -c wss://<controller-ip>:17070/log
  ```

  Observe that the logs are returned in the server’s response.

  ### Code

  The `/log` handlers are registered here
  https://github.com/juju/juju/blob/3.6/apiserver/apiserver.go#L867
  https://github.com/juju/juju/blob/3.6/apiserver/apiserver.go#L980

  And the only auth required is that the incoming request be for an authenticated user

  https://github.com/juju/juju/blob/3.6/apiserver/apiserver.go#L713

  but no specific permission checks are done.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no workarounds.
