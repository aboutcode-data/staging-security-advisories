  - CVE-2023-38690
summary: "matrix-appservice-irc IRC command injection via admin commands containing newlines\n\
  ### Impact\n\nIt is possible to craft a command with newlines which would not be properly\
  \ parsed. This would mean you could pass a string of commands as a channel name, which would\
  \ then be run by the IRC bridge bot. \n\n### Patches\n\nVersions 1.0.1 and above are patched.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no robust workarounds to the bug. You can disable dynamic channels\
  \ in the config to disable the most common execution method but others may exist. It is highly\
  \ recommended to upgrade the bridge.\n\n### Credits\n\nDiscovered and reported by [Val Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/).\n\
  \n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email\
  \ us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org)."
