  - CVE-2017-1000430
summary: |
  Integer overflow in base64
  Affected versions of this crate suffered from an integer overflow bug when
  calculating the size of a buffer to use when encoding base64 using the
  `encode_config_buf` and `encode_config` functions.  If the input string
  was large, this would cause a buffer to be allocated that was too small.
  Since this function writes to the buffer using unsafe code, it would
  allow an attacker to write beyond the buffer, causing memory corruption
  and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

  This flaw was corrected by using checked arithmetic to calculate
  the size of the buffer.
