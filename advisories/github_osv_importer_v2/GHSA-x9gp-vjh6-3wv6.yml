  CKEditor 5 cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the clipboard package
  ### Impact
  A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration.

  This vulnerability affects **only** installations where the editor configuration meets one of the following criteria:
  - [HTML embed plugin](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html/html-embed.html) is enabled
  - Custom plugin introducing editable element which implements view [`RawElement`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_rawelement-ViewRawElement.html) is enabled

  ### Patches
  The problem has been recognized and patched. The fix will be available in version 46.0.3 (and above), and explicitly in version 45.2.2.
