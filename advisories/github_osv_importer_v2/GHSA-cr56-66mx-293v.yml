  Cross-Site Scripting in @toast-ui/editor
  Versions of `@toast-ui/editor` prior to 2.2.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  There are multiple bypasses to the package's built-in XSS sanitization. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a victim's browser.

  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.2.0 or later.
