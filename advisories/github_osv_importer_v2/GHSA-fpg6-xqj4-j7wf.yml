summary: |
  Jenkins Jira Plugin Incorrect Authorization vulnerability
  An improper authorization vulnerability exists in Jenkins Jira Plugin 3.0.1 and earlier in JiraSite.java that allows attackers with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. In version 3.0.2, this form validation method requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for globally defined sites) or Item/Configure permissions (for sites defined for a folder).
