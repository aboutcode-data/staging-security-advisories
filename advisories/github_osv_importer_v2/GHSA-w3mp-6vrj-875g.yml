aliases:
  - CVE-2025-32959
summary: |
  Cuba has a DoS in the File Storage
  ### Impact

  The local file storage implementation does not restrict the size of uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this by uploading excessively large files, potentially causing the server to run out of space and return HTTP 500 error, resulting in a denial of service.

  The severity of the vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the application UI and the generic REST API are typically accessible only to authenticated users.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed in CUBA 7.2.23.

  ### Workarounds

  A workaround for those who are unable to upgrade: [Disable Files Endpoint in CUBA Application](https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-cuba-application).
