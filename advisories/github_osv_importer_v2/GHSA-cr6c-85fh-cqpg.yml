  - CVE-2016-10692
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in haxeshim\nAffected versions of `haxeshim` insecurely\
  \ download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker\
  \ has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace\
  \ the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `haxeshim`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best\
  \ mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available.\
  \ \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package\
  \ is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private\
  \ network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised\
  \ your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors\
  \ or Rogue ISP Employees."
