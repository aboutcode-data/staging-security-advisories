summary: "gmrtd ReadFile Vulnerable to Denial of Service via Excessive TLV Length Values\n#\
  \ Unbounded TLV length in ReadFile can cause Denial of Service\n\n## Summary\n\nA Denial of\
  \ Service vulnerability was identified in `ReadFile()` where unbounded TLV length values could\
  \ lead to excessive CPU and memory usage when processing data from a malicious or non-compliant\
  \ NFC source. This issue has been fixed by enforcing strict limits on acceptable TLV lengths.\n\
  \n## Affected Versions\n\n- **Affected:** All versions prior to **v0.17.2**\n- **Fixed in:**\
  \ **v0.17.2**\n\n## Details\n\n`ReadFile()` processes BER-TLV encoded data returned from an\
  \ NFC or APDU source via a `Transceiver` interface. Prior to the fix, the implementation did\
  \ not enforce an upper bound on long-form TLV length values.\n\nA malicious or non-compliant\
  \ NFC endpoint could advertise an excessively large length (up to 4 GB), causing the library\
  \ to:\n\n- Perform a very large number of read iterations  \n- Allocate excessive memory \
  \ \n- Consume significant CPU resources  \n- Block execution for an extended period  \n\n\
  While such lengths are unrealistic for compliant MRTD or ISO 7816 devices, they can be produced\
  \ by emulated or malicious sources, or by untrusted inputs routed through higher-level APIs.\n\
  \n## Impact\n\nApplications using `gmrtd` to read data from NFC or APDU sources may experience:\n\
  \n- Excessive CPU usage  \n- Memory exhaustion  \n- Application hangs or denial of service\
  \  \n\nNo confidentiality or data integrity impact has been identified.\n\n## Resolution\n\
  \nThis issue has been resolved in **v0.17.2**.\n\nThe fix introduces:\n\n- Enforcement of\
  \ maximum allowable TLV lengths  \n- Upper bounds on the number of read operations required\
  \ to retrieve a file  \n- Rejection of APDUs that exceed the requested response length  \n\
  \n## Recommendation\n\nUsers should **upgrade to v0.17.2 or later**.\n\nNo additional mitigation\
  \ is required once the library is updated.\n\n## Credits\n\nDiscovered and reported by **@ramrunner**."
