summary: "Argo Server TLS requests could be forged by attacker with network access\n### Impact\n\
  \nWe are not aware of any exploits. This is a pro-active fix.\n\nImpacted: \n\n* You are running\
  \ Argo Server < v3.0 with `--secure=true` or >= v3.0 with `--secure` unspecified (note - running\
  \ in secure mode is recommended regardless).\n* The attacker is within your network. If you\
  \ expose Argo Server to the Internet then \"your network\" is \"the Internet\". \n\nThe Argo\
  \ Server's keys are packaged within the image. They could be extracted and used to decrypt\
  \ traffic, or forge requests.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/6540\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\n* Make sure that your Argo Server service or pod are not directly accessible\
  \ outside of your cluster. Put TLS load balancer in front of it.\n\nThis was identified by\
  \ engineers at Jetstack.io"
