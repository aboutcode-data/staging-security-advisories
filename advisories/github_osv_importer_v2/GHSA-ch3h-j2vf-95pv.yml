  XSS Vulnerability in Action View tag helpers
  There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Action View tag helpers. Passing untrusted input as hash keys can lead to a possible XSS vulnerability. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-27777.

  Not affected:       NONE
  Fixed Versions:     7.0.2.4, 6.1.5.1, 6.0.4.8, 5.2.7.1

  ## Impact

  If untrusted data is passed as the hash key for tag attributes, there is a possibility that the untrusted data may not be properly escaped which can lead to an XSS vulnerability.

  ```
  check_box_tag('thename', 'thevalue', false, aria: { malicious_input => 'thevalueofaria' })
  ```

  Where the "malicious_input" variable contains untrusted data.

  ## Workarounds

  Escape the untrusted data before using it as a key for tag helper methods.
