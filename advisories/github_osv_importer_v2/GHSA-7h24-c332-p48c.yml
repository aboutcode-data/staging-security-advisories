summary: |
  vproxy Divide by Zero DoS Vulnerability
  ### Summary
  Untrusted, user-controlled data from the HTTP Proxy-Authorization header can induce a denial of service state.

  ### Details
  Untrusted data is extracted from the user-controlled HTTP Proxy-Authorization header and passed to Extension::try_from and flows into parse_ttl_extension where it is parsed as a TTL value. If an attacker supplies a TTL of zero (e.g. by using a username such as 'configuredUser-ttl-0'), the modulo operation 'timestamp % ttl' will cause a division by zero panic, causing the server to crash causing a denial-of-service.

  The code assumed to be responsible for this can be found here: https://github.com/0x676e67/vproxy/blob/ab304c3854bf8480be577039ada0228907ba0923/src/extension.rs#L173-L183

  ### PoC
  1. Download and run the latest version of vproxy
  2. Send a cUrl request like the following, adjusting address and port as necessary: ```curl -x "http://test-ttl-0:test@127.0.0.1:8101" https://google.com```
  3. Wait for a cUrl error indicating "Proxy CONNECT aborted"
  4. View logs from the vproxy server
  5. Observe that the vproxy server crashed due to a divide-by-zero panic

  ### Impact
  The resulting crash renders the proxy server unusable until it is reset.

  Finally, one last note: I'm reporting this on behalf of another researcher at Black Duck. Credit for discovery should be attributed to David Bohannon ([dbohannon](https://github.com/dbohannon))
