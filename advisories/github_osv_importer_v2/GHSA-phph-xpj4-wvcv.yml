  Cross-Site Scripting in hexo-admin
  All versions of `hexo-admin` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to sanitize rendered markdown, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser if they are able to create new posts.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
