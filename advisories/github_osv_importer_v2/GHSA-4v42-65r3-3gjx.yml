summary: "Amazon S3 Encryption Client for .NET has a Key Commitment Issue\n## Summary\n\nS3\
  \ Encryption Client for .NET (S3EC) is an open-source client-side encryption library used\
  \ to facilitate writing and reading encrypted records to S3.  \n\nWhen the encrypted data\
  \ key (EDK) is stored in an \"Instruction File\" instead of S3's metadata record, the EDK\
  \ is exposed to an \"Invisible Salamanders\" attack  (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016), which\
  \ could allow the EDK to be replaced with a new key. \n\n\n\n## Impact\n\n### Background -\
  \ Key Commitment\n\nThere is a cryptographic property whereby under certain conditions, a\
  \ single ciphertext can be decrypted into 2 different plaintexts by using different encryption\
  \ keys.  To address this issue, strong encryption schemes use what is known as \"key commitment\"\
  , a process by which an encrypted message can only be decrypted by one key; the key used to\
  \ originally encrypt the message. \n\nIn older versions of S3EC, when customers are also using\
  \ a feature called \"Instruction File\" to store EDKs, key commitment is not implemented because\
  \ multiple EDKs could be associated to an underlying encrypted message object.  For such customers\
  \ an attack that leverages the lack of key commitment is possible.  A bad actor would need\
  \ two things to leverage this issue: (i) the ability to create a separate, rogue, EDK that\
  \ will also decrypt the underlying object to produce desired plaintext, and (ii) permission\
  \ to upload a new instruction file to the S3 bucket to replace the existing instruction file\
  \ placed there by the user using the S3C.  Any future attempt to decrypt the underlying encrypted\
  \ message with the S3EC will unwittingly use the rogue EDK to produce a valid plaintext message.\n\
  \nImpacted versions: <= 3.1.0\n\n\n\n## Patches\n\nAmazon S3 Encryption Client is introducing\
  \ the concept of \"key commitment\" to S3EC where the EDK is cryptographically bound to the\
  \ ciphertext in order to address this issue.  In order to maintain compatibility for in-flight\
  \ messages, the fix will be released in two versions.  A code-compatible minor version that\
  \ can read messages with key-commitment but not write them, and a new major version that can\
  \ both read and write messages with key-commitment.  For maximum safety customers are asked\
  \ to upgrade to the latest major version: 4.0.0 or later.\n\n\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThere are\
  \ no workarounds, please upgrade to the suggested version of S3EC.\n\n## References\n\nIf\
  \ users have any questions or comments about this advisory, Amazon S3 Encryption Client asks\
  \ that they contact AWS Security via the issue reporting page or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).\
  \ Please do not create a public GitHub issue."
