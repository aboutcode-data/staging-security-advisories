  Buffer Overflow in centra
  ## Denial of Service

  ### Impact

  Affected Centra versions will, when not in stream mode, buffer responses to requests into memory with no size limit. This issue affects anyone requesting content from untrusted sources.

  ### Patches

  Version 2.4.0 resolves the issue by limiting the size of buffered response body.

  ### Workarounds

  Attempting workarounds isn't recommended. Updating is preferred.
