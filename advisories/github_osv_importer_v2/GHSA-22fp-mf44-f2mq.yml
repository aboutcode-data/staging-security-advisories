summary: "youtube-dl vulnerable to file system modification and RCE through improper file-extension\
  \ sanitization\n#### Description\nThis advisory follows the security advisory [GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j\
  \ published by the _yt-dlp/yt-dlp_ project](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j)\
  \ to aid remediation of the issue in the _ytdl-org/youtube-dl_ project.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\
  _youtube-dl_ does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary\
  \ filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). \n\n###\
  \ Impact\nSince _youtube-dl_ also reads config from the working directory (and, on Windows,\
  \ executables will be executed from the _youtube-dl_ directory by default) the vulnerability\
  \ could allow the unwanted execution of local code, including downloads masquerading as, eg,\
  \ subtitles.\n\n### Patches\nThe versions of _youtube-dl_ listed as _Patched_ remediate this\
  \ vulnerability by disallowing path separators and whitelisting allowed extensions. As a result,\
  \ some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded.\n\n**Master code d42a222 or later\
  \ and nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later** contain the remediation.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  Any/all of the below considerations may limit exposure in case it is necessary to use a vulnerable\
  \ version\n* have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template\n* download from websites that\
  \ you trust\n* do not download to a directory within the executable search `PATH` or other\
  \ sensitive locations, such as your user directory or system directories\n* in Windows versions\
  \ that support it, set [`NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50118548)\
  \ to prevent the _cmd_ shell's executable search adding the default directory before `PATH`\n\
  * consider that the path traversal vulnerability as a result of resolving `non_existent_dir\\\
  ..\\..\\target` does not exist in Linux or macOS\n* ensure the extension of the media to download\
  \ is a common video/audio/... one (use `--get-filename`)\n* omit any of the subtitle options\
  \ (`--write-subs`/` --write-srt`, `--write-auto-subs`/`--write-automatic-subs`, `--all-subs`).\n\
