summary: "[TagAwareCipher] - Decryption Failure (Regex Match)\n### Impact\n\nVulnerability in\
  \ **SecureProps** involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data.\
  \ \n\nThis occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to\
  \ `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\\n`. As a result, the decryption\
  \ process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be\
  \ returned in plain format. \n\nThe vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher`\
  \ with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default).\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch for\
  \ the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version **1.2.2**.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \n**The main recommendation is to update to the latest version as there are no breaking changes.**\n\
  \nIf that's not possible, you can use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated\
  \ with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering\
  \ with regex tag detection logic. \n\nThis workaround is safe but may involve double encoding\
  \ since `TagAwareCipher` uses `Base64Encoder` by default.\n \n### References\n\nReported issue:\
