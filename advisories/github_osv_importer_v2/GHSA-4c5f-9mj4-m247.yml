summary: "flagd: Multiple Go Runtime CVEs Impact Security and Availability\n### Summary\nIn\
  \ 2025, several vulnerabilities in the Go Standard Library were disclosed, impacting Go-based\
  \ applications like flagd (the evaluation engine for OpenFeature). These CVEs primarily focus\
  \ on Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion and Race Conditions in database handling.\
  \ \n\n| CVE ID | Impacted Package | Severity | Description & Impact on flagd |\n| -- | --\
  \ | -- | -- |\n| CVE-2025-47907 | database/sql | 7.0 (High) | Race Condition:  Canceling a\
  \ query during a Scan call can return data from the wrong query. Critical if flagd uses SQL-based\
  \ sync providers (e.g., Postgres), potentially leading to incorrect flag configurations. |\n\
  | CVE-2025-61725 | net/mail | 7.5 (High) | DoS: Inefficient complexity in ParseAddress.  Attackers\
  \ can provide crafted email strings with large domain literals to exhaust CPU if flagd parses\
  \ email-formatted metadata. |\n| CVE-2025-61723 | encoding/pem | 7.5 (High) | DoS: Quadratic\
  \ complexity when parsing invalid PEM inputs. Relevant if flagd loads TLS certificates or\
  \ keys via PEM files from untrusted sources. |\n| CVE-2025-61729 | crypto/x509 | 7.5 (High)\
  \ | Resource Exhaustion: HostnameError.Error() lacks string concatenation limits. A malicious\
  \ TLS certificate with thousands of hostnames could crash flagd during connection handshakes.\
  \ |\n| CVE-2025-58188 | net/http | Medium | Request Smuggling: Improper header handling in\
  \ HTTP/1.1. Could allow attackers to bypass security filters positioned in front of flagd\
  \ sync or evaluation APIs. |\n| CVE-2025-58187 | archive/zip | Medium | DoS:  Improper validation\
  \ of malformed ZIP archives.  Impacts flagd if configured to fetch and unpack zipped configuration\
  \ bundles from remote providers. |"
