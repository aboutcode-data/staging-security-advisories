summary: "Denial of Service due to parser crash\n## Withdrawn\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn\
  \ because it has been found to be a duplicate. Please see the issue [here](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/304#issuecomment-1293654236)\
  \ for more information.\n\n## Original Despcription \n\nThose using FasterXML/woodstox to\
  \ seralize XML data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is\
  \ running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to\
  \ crash by stackoverflow. This effect may support a denial of service attack.\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is only relevant for users making use of the DTD parsing functionality."
