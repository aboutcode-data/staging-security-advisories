  High severity vulnerability that affects indico
  ## Local file disclosure through LaTeX injection

  ### Impact
  An external audit of the Indico codebase has discovered a vulnerability in Indico's LaTeX sanitization code, which could have malicious users to run unsafe LaTeX commands on the server. Such commands allowed for example to read local files (e.g. `indico.conf`).

  As far as we know it is not possible to write files or execute code using this vulnerability.

  ### Patches
  You need to update to [Indico 2.2.3](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v2.2.3) as soon as possible.
  We also released [Indico 2.1.10](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v2.1.10) in case you cannot update to 2.2 for some reason.
  See https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/ for instructions on how to update.

  ### Workarounds
  Setting `XELATEX_PATH = None` in `indico.conf` will result in an error when building a PDF, but without being able to run xelatex, the vulnerability cannot be abused.
