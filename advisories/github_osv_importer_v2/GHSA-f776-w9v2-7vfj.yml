  \ has been fixed in Change Request 1.9.2. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to workaround\
  \ the issue without upgrading by editing the document `ChangeRequest.Code.ChangeRequestSheet`\
  \ and by performing the same change as in the commit: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/7565e720117f73102f5a276239eabfe85e15cff4.\
