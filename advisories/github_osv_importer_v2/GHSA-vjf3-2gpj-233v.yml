  n8n has an SSO Enforcement Bypass in its Self-Service Settings API
  ## Impact
  An authenticated user signed in through Single Sign-On (SSO) could disable SSO enforcement for their own account through the n8n API. This allowed the user to create a local password and authenticate directly with email and password, completely bypassing the organization's SSO policy, centralized identity management, and any identity-provider-enforced multi-factor authentication.

  ## Patches
  The issue has been fixed in n8n version 2.8.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later to remediate the vulnerability.

  ## Workarounds
  If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:
  - Monitor audit logs for users who create local credentials after authenticating via SSO.
  - Restrict the n8n instance to fully trusted users only.

  These workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.
