  By-passing Cross-Site Scripting Protection in HTML Sanitizer
  > ### CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (4.4)

  ### Problem
  Due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of [`typo3/html-sanitizer`](https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/html-sanitizer).

  ### Solution
  Update to `typo3/html-sanitizer` versions 1.5.1 or 2.1.2 that fix the problem described.

  ### Credits
  Thanks to David Klein and Yaniv Nizry who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 security team members Oliver Hader and Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.
