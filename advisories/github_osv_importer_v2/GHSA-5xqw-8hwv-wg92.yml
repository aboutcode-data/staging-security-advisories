summary: "Helm Allows A Specially Crafted JSON Schema To Cause A Stack Overflow\nA Helm contributor\
  \ discovered that a specially crafted JSON Schema within a chart can lead to a stack overflow.\n\
  \n### Impact\nA JSON Schema file within a chart can be crafted with a deeply nested chain\
  \ of references, leading to parser recursion that can exceed the stack size limit and trigger\
  \ a stack overflow. \n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been resolved in Helm v3.17.3.\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\nEnsure that the JSON Schema within any charts loaded by Helm does not have\
  \ a large number of nested references. These JSON Schema files are larger than 10 MiB.\n\n\
  ### For more information\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ document.\n\n### Credits\nDisclosed by Jakub Ciolek at AlphaSense."
