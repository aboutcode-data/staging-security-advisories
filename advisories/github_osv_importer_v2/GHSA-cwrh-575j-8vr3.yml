summary: "Karmada Tar Slips in CRDs archive extraction\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability\
  \ is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nBoth in karmadactl and karmada-operator, it is possible to supply\
  \ a filesystem path, or an HTTP(s) URL to retrieve the custom resource definitions(CRDs) needed\
  \ by karmada. The CRDs are downloaded as a gzipped tarfile and are vulnerable to a TarSlip\
  \ vulnerability. An attacker able to supply a malicious CRD file into a karmada initialization\
  \ could write arbitrary files in arbitrary paths of the filesystem.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the\
  \ problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nFrom karmada version v1.12.0,\
  \ when processing custom CRDs files, CRDs archive verification is utilized to enhance file\
  \ system robustness.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the\
  \ vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nWhen using `karmadactl init` to set up Karmada, if\
  \ you need to set flag `--crd` to customize the CRD files required for karmada initialization,\
  \ you can manually inspect the CRD files to check whether they contain sequences such as `../`\
  \ that would alter file paths, to determine if they potentially include malicious files. \n\
  \nWhen using karmada-operator to set up Karmada, you must upgrade your karmada-operator to\
  \ one of the fixed versions.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find\
  \ out more?_\n\n1. Enhancements made from the Karmada community: https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/5713,\
  \ https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/5703"
