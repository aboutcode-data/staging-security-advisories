  - CVE-2023-41058
summary: |
  Trigger `beforeFind` not invoked in internal query pipeline when fetching pointer
  ### Impact

  A Parse Pointer can be used to access internal Parse Server classes. It can also be used to circumvent the `beforeFind` query trigger which can be an additional vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify an incoming query.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a patch in the internal query pipeline to prevent a Parse Pointer to be used to access internal Parse Server classes or circumvent the `beforeFind` trigger.

  ### Workarounds

  There is no known workaround to prevent a Parse Pointer to be used to access internal Parse Server classes. A workaround if a `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer is to instead use the Parse Server provided [security layers](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security) to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control.
