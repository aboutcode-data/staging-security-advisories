  - CVE-2020-4041
summary: "The filename of uploaded files vulnerable to stored XSS\n### Impact\n\nThe filename\
  \ of uploaded files was vulnerable to stored XSS. It is not possible to inject javascript\
  \ code in the file name when creating/uploading the file. But, once created/uploaded, it can\
  \ be renamed to inject the payload in it. \n\nAdditionally, the measures to prevent renaming\
  \ the file to disallowed filename extensions could be circumvented.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis\
  \ is fixed in Bolt 3.7.1.\n\n### References\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/bolt/bolt/pull/7853"
