summary: "Hono vulnerable to Vary Header Injection leading to potential CORS Bypass\n### Summary\
  \  \nA flaw in the CORS middleware allowed request `Vary` headers to be reflected into the\
  \ response, enabling attacker-controlled `Vary` values and potentially affecting cache behavior.\n\
  \n### Details  \nThe middleware previously copied the `Vary` header from the request when\
  \ `origin` was not set to `\"*\"`.  Since `Vary` is a response header that should only be\
  \ managed by the server, this could allow an attacker to influence caching behavior or cause\
  \ inconsistent CORS handling.\n\nMost environments will see impact only when shared caches\
  \ or proxies rely on the `Vary` header. The practical effect varies by configuration.\n\n\
  ### Impact  \nMay cause cache key pollution and inconsistent CORS enforcement in certain setups.\
  \ No direct confidentiality, integrity, or availability impact in default configurations.\
  \  \n\n### Resolution  \nUpdate to the latest patched release. The CORS middleware has been\
  \ corrected to handle `Vary` exclusively as a response header."
