summary: |
  Jenkins Beaker builder Plugin Missing Authorization vulnerability
  Jenkins Beaker builder Plugin 1.10 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
