  - CVE-2025-32783
summary: "Unregistered users can see \"public\" messages from a closed wiki via notifications\
  \ from a different wiki\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability impacts users of a subwiki of XWiki\
  \ where Message Stream is enabled and use, if they configured their wiki to be closed by selecting\
  \ \"Prevent unregistered users to view pages\" in the Administrations Rights. \n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ is that any message sent in a subwiki to \"everyone\" is actually sent to the farm: any\
  \ visitor of the main wiki will be able to see that message through the Dashboard, even if\
  \ the subwiki is configured to be private.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has not been patched\
  \ and is not going to be patched in the future: Message Stream has been deprecated in XWiki\
  \ 16.8.0RC1 and is not maintained anymore. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nMessage Stream is disabled\
  \ by default, it's advised to keep it disabled from Administration > Social > Message Stream.\n\
  \n### References\n\n  * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17154"
