  - CVE-2025-24363
summary: "HL7 FHIR IG Publisher potentially exposes GitHub repo user and credential information\n\
  ### Impact\nIn CI contexts, the IG Publisher CLI uses git commands to determine the URL of\
  \ the originating repo. If the repo was cloned, or otherwise set to use a repo that uses a\
  \ username and credential based URL, the entire URL will be included in the built Implementation\
  \ Guide, exposing username and credential. This does not impact users that clone public repos\
  \ without credentials, such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure.\n\
  \n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in release [1.8.9](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases/tag/1.8.9)\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nUsers should update to 1.8.9 or the latest release \n\nOR \n\nUsers should\
  \ ensure the IG repo they are publishing does not have username or credentials included in\
  \ the `origin` URL. Running the command `git remote origin url` should return a URL that contains\
  \ no username, password, or token.\n\nOR\n\nUsers should run the IG Publisher CLI with the\
  \ `-repo` parameter and specify a URL that contains no username, password, or token."
