summary: |
  NodeBB account takeover via SSO plugins
  _This is a historical security advisory, pertaining to a vulnerability that was reported, patched, and published in 2021. It is listed here for completeness and for CVE tracking purposes._

  ### Impact
  Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out.

  This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted MITM attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process.

  ### Patches
  The issue has been fully patched as of v1.17.2.

  The patch commit can be found at https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4

  ### Workarounds
  Site maintainers can cherry-pick https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4 into their codebase to patch the exploit.
