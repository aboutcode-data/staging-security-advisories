summary: "Voilà Local file inclusion\n### Impact\n\nAny deployment of voilà dashboard allow\
  \ local file inclusion, that is to say any file on a filesystem that is readable by the user\
  \ that runs the voilà dashboard server can be downloaded by someone with network access to\
  \ the server. \n\nWhether this still requires authentication depends on how voilà is deployed.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nThis is patched in 0.2.17+, 0.3.8+, 0.4.4+, 0.5.6+\n\n### Workarounds\n\n\
  None.\n\n\n### References\n\nCWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n\n\n### Original\
  \ report\n\nI have found a local file inclusion vulnerability in one of your subprojects,\
  \ voila (https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila).\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the \"\
  /static\" Route, and can be exploited by simply making a request such as this:\n\n```\n$ curl\
  \ localhost:8866/static/etc/passwd\n```\n\n...or by using a webbrowser to download the file.\n\
  \nI dug into the source code, and I think the offending line is here: https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/blob/8419cc7d79c0bb1dabfbd9ec49cb957740609d4d/voila/app.py#L664\n\
  `\"static_path\"` gets set to `\"/\"`, irrespective of the actual `\"--static\"` cli option.\
  \ Because of that, the `tornado.web.StaticFileHandler` gets initialized with `path=\"/\"`.\
  \ Then, `tornado.web.StaticFileHandler.get` calls `tornado.web.StaticFileHandler.get_absolute_path`\
  \ with `root=\"/\"` and `path=\"[USER SUPPLIED PATH]\"`, which leads to local file inclusion.\
  \ An attacker can request any file on the system they want (that the user running voila has\
  \ access to).\n\nI suspect this was an oversight during development. Setting `static_path=self.static_root`\
  \ (the aforementioned correct cli option) in line 664 provides the intended behavior and restricts\
  \ the file access to the static directory.\nFrom what I can tell, this line has been in the\
  \ repository since September 2018. This is the commit that added it: https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila/commit/28faacc9b03b160fd8fa920ad045f4ec0667ab67\n\
  \nI have found multiple voila instances online that are impacted, such as:\n- ... [redacted]\n\
  - ... [redacted]\n- ... [redacted]\n\n...but many more probably exist. They're easy to identify\
  \ by `[redacted]` Therefore the Issue should be fixed as soon as possible, and a security\
  \ advisory should be released to inform the impacted users."
