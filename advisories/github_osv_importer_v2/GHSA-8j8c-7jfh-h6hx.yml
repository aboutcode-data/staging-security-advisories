summary: "Code Injection in js-yaml\nVersions of `js-yaml` prior to 3.13.1 are vulnerable to\
  \ Code Injection. The `load()` function may execute arbitrary code injected through a malicious\
  \ YAML file. Objects that have `toString` as key, JavaScript code as value and are used as\
  \ explicit mapping keys allow attackers to execute the supplied code through the `load()`\
  \ function. The `safeLoad()` function is unaffected.\n\nAn example payload is \n`{ toString:\
  \ !<tag:yaml.org,2002:js/function> 'function (){return Date.now()}' } : 1` \nwhich returns\
  \ the object \n{\n  \"1553107949161\": 1\n}\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 3.13.1."
