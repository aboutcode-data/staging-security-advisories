summary: |
  Brute Force Authentication Tags of CookieStore Sessions in Auth0-PHP SDK
  **Overview**
  Session cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access.

  **Am I Affected?**
  You are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following pre-conditions:
  1. Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the following SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK:
      a. Auth0/symfony,
      b. Auth0/laravel-auth0,
      c. Auth0/wordpress,
  2. Session storage configured with CookieStore.

  **Fix**
  Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0. As an additional precautionary measure, we recommend rotating your cookie encryption keys. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.

  **Acknowledgement**
  Okta would like to thank Félix Charette for discovering this vulnerability.
