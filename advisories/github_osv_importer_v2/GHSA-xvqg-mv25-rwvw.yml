aliases:
  - CVE-2022-39203
summary: |
  Parsing issue in matrix-org/node-irc leading to room takeovers
  ### Impact

  Attackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel, allowing them to grant themselves permissions in the channel.

  ### Patched

  The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0.

  ### Workarounds

  Disable dynamic channel joining via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new channels, which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of what is already bridged, and what is specified in the config.
