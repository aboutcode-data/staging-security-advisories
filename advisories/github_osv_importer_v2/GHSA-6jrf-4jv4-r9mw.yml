summary: "tendermint-rs's Light Client Verifier allows malicious validators to spoof votes from\
  \ other validators\nName: ISA-2025-003: Malicious validator can spoof votes from other validators\
  \ \nComponent: tendermint-rs\nCriticality: High (Catastrophic Impact; Rare Likelihood per\
  \ [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\n\
  Affected versions: <= v0.40.2\nAffected users: Everyone\n\n### Description\n\ntendermint-rs\
  \ contains a critical vulnerability in its light client implementation due to insecure handling\
  \ of corrupted validator sets. Because it doesn't check that the validator address is correctly\
  \ derived from the validator's public key when counting votes, it is possible to spoof votes\
  \ from other validators. The result is being able to construct the malicious block and cheat\
  \ the light client. The light client will accept such a block, seemingly signed by 2/3+ majority.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nThe new tendermint-rs release [v0.40.3](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/releases/tag/v0.40.3)\
  \ fixes this issue.\n\nUnreleased code in the main branch is patched as well.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nThere are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* March 12, 2025, 13:41pm\
  \ PST: Issue reported\n* March 12, 2025, 03:00am PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n\
  \nThis issue was reported by Felix Wilhelm from [Asymmetric Research](https://www.asymmetric.re/)."
