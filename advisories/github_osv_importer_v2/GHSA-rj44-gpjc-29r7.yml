summary: |
  [thi.ng/egf] Potential arbitrary code execution of `#gpg`-tagged property values
  ### Impact

  Potential for arbitrary code execution in `#gpg`-tagged property values (only if `decrypt: true` option is enabled)

  ### Patches

  [A fix](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/3e14765d6bfd8006742c9e7860bc7d58ae94dfa5) has already been released as v0.4.0

  ### Workarounds

  By default, EGF parse functions do NOT attempt to decrypt values (since GPG is only available in non-browser env).

  However, if GPG encrypted values are used/required:

  1. Perform a regex search for `#gpg`-tagged values in the EGF source file/string and check for backtick (\`) chars in the encrypted value string
  2. Replace/remove them or skip parsing if present...
