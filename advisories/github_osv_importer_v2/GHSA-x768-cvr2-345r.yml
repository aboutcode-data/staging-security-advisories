summary: "Un-sanitized metric name or labels can be used to take over exported metrics\n###\
  \ Impact\n\nIn code which applies _un-sanitized string values into metric names or labels_,\
  \ like this:\n\n```swift\nlet lang = try? request.query-get(String.self, at: \"lang\")\nCounter\
  \ (\n  label: \"language\", \n  dimensions: [(\"lang\", lang ?? \"unknown\" )]\n)\n```\n\n\
  an attacker could make use of this and send a `?lang` query parameter containing newlines,\
  \ `}`  or similar characters which can lead to the attacker taking over the exported format\
  \ -- including creating unbounded numbers of stored metrics, inflating server memory usage,\
  \ or causing \"bogus\" metrics.\n\n### Patches\nThe default strategy to sanitize labels was\
  \ moved deeper into the library, preventing illegal characters from appearing in name, label\
  \ keys and values.\n\nMetric names and label names are now validated against the following\
  \ requirement: `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*` (for metric names) and `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`\
  \ (for metric label names). Label values are not validated as they are allowed to contain\
  \ any unicode characters. Developers _must_ validate labels themselves and not allow malicious\
  \ input.\n\nThe approach taken here mirrors the approach taken in the Go reference implementation.\n\
  \n### Discussion\n\nIt is **strongly discouraged** to use un-sanitized user input as names\
  \ or labels in general, because they can lead to un-bounded growth of metrics, even as this\
  \ vulnerability is patched and result in a Denial-of-Service attack opportunity -- **regardless**\
  \ how well the library is sanitizing the inputs. We strongly recommend only using a sanitized\
  \ set of values for your metrics names and labels. E.g., a `\"lang\"` label, should only use\
  \ an expected set of values that can be used, and ignore other ones -- otherwise a determined\
  \ attacker could create one metric per different label key, leading to unbounded memory use\
  \ growth as metrics with distinct values must be kept in memory.\n\n**Validating label values:**\n\
  \nThe library will **NOT** automatically validate and replace strings offered as label values.\n\
  Developers **must** validate label values themselves, and it is strongly recommended to only\
  \ accept a well known set of values.\n\nIt is possible to configure the `PrometheusSanitizer`\
  \ to apply whatever validation you deem necessary:\n\n```swift\nlet mySanitizer = PrometheusSanitizer\
  \ { metricName, labels in\n  // ... your logic here ...\n  (metricName, labels)\n}\n\nlet\
  \ registry = PrometheusCollectorRegistry(sanitizer: mySanitizer)\nlet factory = PrometheusMetricsFactory(factory:\
  \ registry)\n\n// swift-metrics\nMetricsSystem.bootstrap(factory)\n```\n\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nDevelopers must validate user input before using it as metric names, label names or values.\
  \ This follows common practice of not trusting any user input without sanitization.\n\n###\
  \ Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Jonas Dörr for bringing out attention to the issue."
