  - CVE-2020-15212
summary: |
  Out of bounds access in tensorflow-lite
  ### Impact
  In TensorFlow Lite models using segment sum can trigger writes outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers by inserting negative elements in the segment ids tensor:
  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L2625-L2631

  Users having access to `segment_ids_data` can alter `output_index` and then write to outside of `output_data` buffer.

  This might result in a segmentation fault but it can also be used to further corrupt the memory and can be chained with other vulnerabilities to create more advanced exploits.

  ### Patches
  We have patched the issue in 204945b and will release patch releases for all affected versions.

  We recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.

  ### Workarounds
  A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that the segment ids are all positive, although this only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model.

  A similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime between inference steps.

  If the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.
