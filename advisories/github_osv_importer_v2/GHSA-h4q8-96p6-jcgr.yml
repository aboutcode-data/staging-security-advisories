  - CVE-2022-39304
summary: |
  ghinstallation returns app JWT in error responses
  ### Impact

  In ghinstallation v1, when the request to refresh an installation token failed, the HTTP request and response would be returned for debugging.

  https://github.com/bradleyfalzon/ghinstallation/blob/24e56b3fb7669f209134a01eff731d7e2ef72a5c/transport.go#L172-L174

  The request contained the bearer JWT for the App, and was returned back to clients. This token is short lived (10 minute maximum).

  ### Patches

  - This has already been patched in d24f14f8be70d94129d76026e8b0f4f9170c8c3e, and is available in releases >= v2.0.0.
