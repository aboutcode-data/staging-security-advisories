  Minor fix to previous patch for CVE-2022-35918
  ### Impact

  The initial vulnerability identified in Streamlit apps using custom components, allowing for directory traversal attacks, was addressed in version 1.11.1. However, a minor issue persisted, which could still potentially expose certain files on the server file-system under specific conditions.

  ### Patches

  We released an update in version 1.30.0 to further tighten security measures. Users are strongly advised to update to version 1.30.0 immediately for optimal security.

  ### Workarounds

  No additional workarounds are necessary once the update to version 1.30.0 is applied.
