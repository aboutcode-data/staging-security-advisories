aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31667
summary: |
  ### Impact
  Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating a robot account that
  belongs to a project that the authenticated user doesn’t have access to. API call:

  PUT /robots/{robot_id}

  By sending a request that attempts to update a robot account, and specifying a robot
  account id and robot account name that belongs to a different project that the user
  doesn’t have access to, it was possible to revoke the robot account permissions.

  ### Patches
  This and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no workarounds available.
