summary: "go-tuf improperly validates the configured threshold for delegations\n# Security Disclosure:\
  \ Improper validation of configured threshold for delegations\n\n## Summary\n\nA compromised\
  \ or misconfigured TUF repository can have the configured value of signature thresholds set\
  \ to 0, which effectively disables signature verification. \n\n## Impact\n\nUnathorized modification\
  \ to TUF metadata files is possible at rest, or during transit as no integrity checks are\
  \ made.\n\n## Patches\n\nUpgrade to v2.3.1\n\n## Workarounds\n\nAlways make sure that the\
  \ TUF metadata roles are configured with a threshold of at least 1.\n\n## Affected code:\n\
  \nThe `metadata.VerifyDelegate` did not verify the configured threshold prior to comparison.\
  \ This means that a misconfigured TUF repository could disable the signature verification\
  \ by setting the threshold to 0, or a negative value (and so always make the signature threshold\
  \ computation to pass)."
