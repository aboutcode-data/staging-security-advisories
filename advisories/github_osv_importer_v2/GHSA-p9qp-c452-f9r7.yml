summary: "Synapse Denial of service due to incorrect application of event authorization rules\
  \ during state resolution\n### Impact\nIf Synapse and a malicious homeserver are both joined\
  \ to the same room, the malicious homeserver can trick Synapse into accepting previously rejected\
  \ events into its view of the current state of that room. This can be exploited in a way that\
  \ causes all further messages and state changes sent in that room from the vulnerable homeserver\
  \ to be rejected.\n\nSynapse homeservers are affected by this issue if and only if they are\
  \ joined to rooms which members of untrusted homeservers are joined or invited to. \n\n- Synapse\
  \ homeservers in rooms available over public federation **are** affected.\n- Synapse homeservers\
  \ with federation disabled are not affected.\n- Synapse homeservers in a closed federation\
  \ containing only trusted servers are not affected.\n- Synapse homeservers which are only\
  \ joined to rooms with federation disabled[^1] are not affected.\n\n### Patches\nAdministrators\
  \ of homeservers with federation enabled are advised to upgrade to 1.68.0 or higher.\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\n * Federation can be disabled by setting [`federation_domain_whitelist`](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist)\
  \ to an empty list (`[]`). from the vulnerable homeserver to be rejected. This issue has been\
  \ patched in version 1.68.0\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13723\n\
  \n[^1]: See `m.federate` in the [`m.room.create` definition](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#mroomcreate).\n\
