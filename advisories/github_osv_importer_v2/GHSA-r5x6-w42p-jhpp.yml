aliases:
  - CVE-2023-27595
summary: |
  Cilium eBPF filters may be temporarily removed during agent restart
  ### Impact

  When Cilium is started, there is a short period when Cilium eBPF programs are not attached to the host. During this period, the host does not implement any of Cilium's featureset. This can cause disruption to newly established connections during this period due to the lack of Load Balancing, or can cause Network Policy bypass due to the lack of Network Policy enforcement during the window. This vulnerability impacts any Cilium-managed endpoints on the node (such as Kubernetes Pods), as well as the host network namespace (including Host Firewall).

  ### Patches

  This vulnerability is fixed by https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/24336, included in Cilium 1.13.1 or later. Cilium releases 1.12.x, 1.11.x and earlier are not affected.

  ### Workarounds

  There are no known workarounds.

  ### Acknowledgements

  The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to Louis DeLosSantos and Timo Beckers for investigating and fixing the issue.
