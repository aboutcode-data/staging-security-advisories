summary: "vLLM vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through MediaConnector\n###\
  \ Summary\nA Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `MediaConnector`\
  \ class within the vLLM project's multimodal feature set. The load_from_url and load_from_url_async\
  \ methods obtain and process media from URLs provided by users, using different Python parsing\
  \ libraries when restricting the target host. These two parsing libraries have different interpretations\
  \ of backslashes, which allows the host name restriction to be bypassed. This allows an attacker\
  \ to coerce the vLLM server into making arbitrary requests to internal network resources.\n\
  \nThis vulnerability is particularly critical in containerized environments like `llm-d`,\
  \ where a compromised vLLM pod could be used to scan the internal network, interact with other\
  \ pods, and potentially cause Denial of Service or access sensitive data. For example, an\
  \ attacker could make the vLLM pod send malicious requests to an internal `llm-d` management\
  \ endpoint, leading to system instability by falsely reporting metrics like the KV cache state.\n\
  \n### Details\nThe core of the vulnerability lies in the `MediaConnector.load_from_url` method\
  \ and its asynchronous counterpart. These methods accept a URL string to fetch media content\
  \ (images, audio, video).\n\n>     def load_from_url(\n>         self,\n>         url: str,\n\
  >         media_io: MediaIO[_M],\n>         *,\n>         fetch_timeout: int | None = None,\n\
  >     ) -> _M:  # type: ignore[type-var]\n>         url_spec = urlparse(url)\n> \n>      \
  \   if url_spec.scheme.startswith(\"http\"):\n>             self._assert_url_in_allowed_media_domains(url_spec)\n\
  > \n>             connection = self.connection\n>             data = connection.get_bytes(\n\
  >                 url,\n>                 timeout=fetch_timeout,\n>                 allow_redirects=envs.VLLM_MEDIA_URL_ALLOW_REDIRECTS,\n\
  >             )\n> \n>             return media_io.load_bytes(data)\n\nThe URL validation\
  \ uses the `urlparse` function from Python's `urllib` module, while the request is made using\
  \ the `request` function from Python's `requests` module. The `requests` module's underlying\
  \ URL parsing is implemented using the `parse_url` function from Python's `urllib3`. These\
  \ two parsing functions follow different URL specifications; one is implemented according\
  \ to the RFC 3986 specification, and the other is implemented according to the WHATWG Living\
  \ Standard. There is a difference in how the two functions handle backslashes (`\\`) in URLs,\
  \ which allows the hostname restriction to be bypassed.\n\n### Fix\n\n* https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32746"
