  Regex denial of service vulnerability in codesample plugin
  ### Impact
  A regex denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in a dependency of the `codesample` plugin. The vulnerability allowed poorly formed ruby code samples to lock up the browser while performing syntax highlighting. This impacts users of the `codesample` plugin using TinyMCE 5.5.1 or lower.

  ### Patches
  This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.6.0 by upgrading to a version of the dependency without the vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds
  To work around this vulnerability, either:
  - Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.6.0 or higher
  - Disable the `codesample` plugin
  - Disable ruby code samples using the [codesample_languages](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/opensource/codesample/#exampleusingcodesample_languages) setting
  - Override the PrismJS syntax highlighter to version 1.21.0 or higher using the [codesample_global_prismjs](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/opensource/codesample/#codesample_global_prismjs) setting

  ### Acknowledgements
  Tiny Technologies would like to thank Erik Krogh Kristensen at GitHub for discovering this vulnerability.
