summary: "Information disclosure through error object in auth0.js\n## Overview\nBetween versions\
  \ 8.0.0 and  9.13.1(inclusive), in the case of an (authentication) error, the error object\
  \ returned by the library contains the original request of the user, which may include the\
  \ plaintext password the user entered. \n\nIf the error object is exposed or logged without\
  \ modification, the application risks password exposure.\n\n## Am I affected?\nYou are affected\
  \ by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:\n\n- You are using Auth0.js\
  \ version between 8.0.0 and 9.13.1(inclusive).\n- You store or display error objects without\
  \ filtering. \n\n## How to fix that?\nDevelopers should upgrade auth0.js to version 9.13.2\
  \ or later where user inputted passwords are masked in errors. If upgrading is not possible,\
  \ a temporary fix may include not storing the error object or displaying it publicly without\
  \ modification.\n\n## Will this update impact my users?\n\nThis fix patches the Auth0.js and\
  \ may require changes in application code due to password no longer available in error object,\
  \ but it will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions."
