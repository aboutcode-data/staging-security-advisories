  - CVE-2023-45683
summary: "Cross-site Scripting via missing Binding syntax validation\n### Impact\n\nThe package\
  \ does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding being parsed.\n\nIf\
  \ abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and\
  \ inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in\
  \ the IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow.\n\nConsequently, an\
  \ attacker may perform any authenticated action as the victim once the victim’s browser loaded\
  \ the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider.\n\nNote: The severity\
  \ is considered “High” because the SP registration is commonly an unrestricted operation in\
  \ IdPs, hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible to ease the IdP\
  \ interoperability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is fixed in 0.4.14\n\n### Workarounds\n\n\
  Users of the package can perform external validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata, or\
  \ restrict the ability for end-users to upload arbitrary metadata. \n\n### References\n\n\
  This issue was reported by Francesco Lacerenza from Doyensec."
