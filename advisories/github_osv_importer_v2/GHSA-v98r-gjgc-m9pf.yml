summary: |
  Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in Jenkins Promoted Builds Plugin
  Jenkins promoted builds Plugin 873.v6149db_d64130 and earlier, except 3.10.1, does not escape the name and description of Promoted Build parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

  Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the \"Build With Parameters\" and \"Parameters\" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the \"Build With Parameters\" and \"Parameters\" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix.
