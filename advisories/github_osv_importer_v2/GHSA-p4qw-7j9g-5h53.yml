summary: |
  ts-asn1-der has Incorrect DER Encoding of Numbers Leading to Denial of Service and Incorrect Value Representation
  ### Impact

  Incorrect `number` DER encoding can lead to denial on service for absolute values in the range `2**31` -- `2**32 - 1`. The arithmetic in the `numBitLen` didn't take into account that values in this range could result in a negative result upon applying the `>>` operator, leading to an infinite loop.

  In addition, `number` encoding had a few other issues that resulted it in it not encoding values correctly.

  ### Patches

  The issue is patched in version `1.0.4`. Users are recommended to upgrade as soon as possible.

  ### Workarounds

  If upgrading is not an option, the issue can be mitigated by validating inputs to `Asn1Integer` to ensure that they are not smaller than `-2**31 + 1` and no larger than `2**31 - 1`. Although `Asn1Integer` supports `bigint` inputs, some additional implementation issues make using `bigint` as a mitigation inviable, as it will result in incorrect values.

  If upgrading is not an option and range checks are impractical or undesirable, input to `Asn1Integer` can be provided as a buffer to be used directly. Note that this requires computing the correct DER encoding externally.
