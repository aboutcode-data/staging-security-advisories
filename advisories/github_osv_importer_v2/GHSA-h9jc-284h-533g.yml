summary: |
  Context isolation bypass via contextBridge in Electron
  ### Impact
  Apps using both `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected.

  This is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no app-side workarounds, you must update your Electron version to be protected.

  ### Fixed Versions
  * `9.0.0-beta.21`
  * `8.2.4`
  * `7.2.4`
