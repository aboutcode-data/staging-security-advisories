  - CVE-2026-24053
summary: "Claude Code has a Path Restriction Bypass via ZSH Clobber which Allows Arbitrary File\
  \ Writes\nDue to a Bash command validation flaw in parsing ZSH clobber syntax, it was possible\
  \ to bypass directory restrictions and write files outside the current working directory without\
  \ user permission prompts. Exploiting this required the user to use ZSH and the ability to\
  \ add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code\
  \ auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised\
  \ to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks https://hackerone.com/alexbernier\
  \ for reporting this issue!"
