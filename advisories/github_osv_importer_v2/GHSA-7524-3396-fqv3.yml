  - CVE-2025-31138
summary: |
  tarteaucitron.js allows UI manipulation via unrestricted CSS injection
  A vulnerability was identified in `tarteaucitron.js`, where user-controlled inputs for element dimensions (`width` and `height`) were not properly validated. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to set values like `100%;height:100%;position:fixed;`, potentially covering the entire viewport and facilitating clickjacking attacks.

  ## Impact
  An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to:
  - Overlay malicious UI elements on top of legitimate content,
  - Trick users into interacting with hidden elements (clickjacking),
  - Disrupt the intended functionality and accessibility of the website.

  ## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/25fcf828aaa55306ddc09cfbac9a6f8f126e2d07
  The issue was resolved by enforcing strict validation and sanitization of user-provided CSS values to prevent unintended UI manipulation.
