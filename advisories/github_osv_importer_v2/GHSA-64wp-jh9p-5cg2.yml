summary: "RSSHub SSRF vulnerability\n## Summary\n\nRSSHub is vulnerable to Server-Side Request\
  \ Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests\
  \ from the server to other servers or resources on the network.\n\n## Description\n\nAn attacker\
  \ can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the affected routes with a malicious\
  \ URL. For example, if an attacker controls the `ATTACKER.HOST` domain, they can send a request\
  \ to affected routes with the value set to `ATTACKER.HOST%2F%23`.\nThe `%2F` and `%23` characters\
  \ are URL-encoded versions of the forward-slash (`/`) and pound (`#`) characters, respectively.\
  \ In this context, an attacker could use those characters to append the base URL (i.e. `https://${input}.defined.host`)\
  \ to be modified to `https://ATTACKER.HOST/#.defined.host`. This will cause the server to\
  \ send a request to the attacker-controlled domain, allowing the attacker to potentially gain\
  \ access to sensitive information or perform further attacks on the server. \n\n## Impact\n\
  \nAn attacker could use this vulnerability to send requests to internal or any other servers\
  \ or resources on the network, potentially gain access to sensitive information that would\
  \ not normally be accessible and amplifying the impact of the attack.\n\n## Reference\n\n\
