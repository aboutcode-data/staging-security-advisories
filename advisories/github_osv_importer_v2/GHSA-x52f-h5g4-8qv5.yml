summary: |
  Marp Core allows XSS by improper neutralization of HTML sanitization
  Marp Core ([`@marp-team/marp-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@marp-team/marp-core)) from v3.0.2 to v3.9.0 and v4.0.0, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)  due to improper neutralization of HTML sanitization.

  ### Impact

  Marp Core includes an HTML sanitizer with allowlist support. In the affected versions, the built-in allowlist is enabled by default. When the allowlist is active, if insufficient HTML comments are included, the sanitizer may fail to properly sanitize HTML content and lead cross-site scripting (XSS).

  ### Patches

  Marp Core [v3.9.1](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/releases/tag/v3.9.1) and [v4.0.1](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/releases/tag/v4.0.1) have been patched to fix that.

  ### Workarounds

  If you are unable to update the package immediately, disable all HTML tags by setting `html: false` option in the `Marp` class constructor.

  ```javascript
  const marp = new Marp({ html: false })
  ```
