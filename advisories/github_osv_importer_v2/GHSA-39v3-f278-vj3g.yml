  @backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend storage bucket Directory Traversal vulnerability
  ### Impact

  When using the AWS S3 or GCS storage provider for TechDocs it is possible to access content in the entire storage bucket. This can leak contents of the bucket that are not intended to be accessible, as well as bypass permission checks in Backstage.

  ### Patches

  This has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package.
