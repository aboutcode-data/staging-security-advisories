aliases:
  - CVE-2023-38495
summary: |
  Possible image tampering from missing image validation for Packages
  ### Impact

  Crossplanes image backend does not validate the byte contents of Crossplane packages. As such, Crossplane does not detect if an attacker has tampered with a Package.

  ### Patches

  The problem has been fixed in 1.11.5, 1.12.3 and 1.13.0, all the supported versions of Crossplane at the time of writing.

  ### Workarounds

  Only using images from trusted sources and keeping Package editing/creating privileges to administrators only, which should be both considered already best practices.

  ### References
