summary: "copyparty vulnerable to path traversal attack\n# Summary\nAll versions before 1.8.2\
  \ have a path traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to download unintended files from\
  \ the server.\n\n# Details\nUnauthenticated users were able to retrieve any files which are\
  \ accessible (according to OS-level permissions) from the copyparty process. Usually, this\
  \ is all files that are readable by the OS account which is used to run copyparty.\n\nThe\
  \ vulnerability did not make it possible to list the contents of folders, so an attacker needs\
  \ to know the full absolute path to the file, or the relative path from where copyparty is\
  \ installed.\n\nSome methods of running copyparty ([prisonparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/bin#prisonpartysh),\
  \ the [nix package](https://github.com/9001/copyparty#nix-package), and [docker](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/scripts/docker))\
  \ had a mitigating effect, mostly reducing the attack scope to files inside copyparty volumes,\
  \ and possibly the copyparty config file.\n\n# Checking for attacks\nPlease keep in mind that,\
  \ if an attacker were to find a way to overwrite the logs, for example by discovering the\
  \ password to another service with sufficient privileges, then the following approaches cannot\
  \ be trusted.\n\nif copyparty was only accessible through a reverse proxy, then all attacks\
  \ would be visible in the webserver access-log as URLs which contain both `.cpr/` and `%2F`\n\
  * nginx:\n  ```bash\n  (gzip -dc access.log*.gz; cat access.log) | sed -r 's/\" [0-9]+ .*//'\
  \ | grep -E 'cpr/.*%2[^0]' | grep -vF data:image/svg\n  ```\n\nHowever, if copyparty was directly\
  \ accessible from the internet, then any successful attacks (file retrievals) would unfortunately\
  \ leave no trace. That said, it is very probable that an attacker would make at least one\
  \ invalid attempt, which would become apparent in the copyparty server log, detectable with\
  \ `grep -aE '(Errno|Permission).*\\.cpr/'` revealing the following:\n* python2 example: `[IOError]\
  \ [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/shadow', .cpr//etc/shadow`\n* python3 example: `[PermissionError]\
  \ [Errno 13] Permission denied: b'/etc/shadow', .cpr//etc/shadow`\n \n\nProviding an exact\
  \ command for this approach is difficult, as it depends on how copyparty is deployed;\n* if\
  \ copyparty was running as a systemd service: `journalctl -am | grep -aE '(Errno|Permission).*\\\
  .cpr/'`\n* if copyparty was logging to a compressed file: `xz -kdc thefilename.xz | grep -aE\
  \ '(Errno|Permission).*\\.cpr/'`\n* if the copyparty log is available in a plaintext file:\
  \ `grep -aE '(Errno|Permission).*\\.cpr/' thefilename.txt`\n\n# PoC / attack example\n```bash\n\
  curl -sik http://127.0.0.1:3923/.cpr/%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\ncurl -sik http://127.0.0.1:3923/.cpr/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\n\
