summary: "Prototype pollution in jsii.configureCategories\n## Summary\n\n`jsii` is a TypeScript\
  \ to JavaScript compiler that also extracts an interface definition manifest to generate RPC\
  \ stubs in various programming languages. jsii is typically used as a command-line tool, but\
  \ it can also be loaded as a library.\nWhen loaded as a library into a larger application,\
  \ prototype pollution may happen if untrusted user input is passed to the library. When used\
  \ as a command line-tool, this pollution cannot occur.\n\n## Impact\n\nYou may be impacted\
  \ if you have written an application that loads jsii as a library, and passes untrusted user\
  \ input into the `jsii.configureCategories()` function. In that case, a user can craft input\
  \ in such a way that, following the invocation, a field named \"category\" with a user-controlled\
  \ value is added to the JavaScript Object prototype. This will cause every object in the program\
  \ (both new and existing) to have a field named \"category\", even if it shouldn't. \n\n**This\
  \ will not affect jsii itself, but it might affect the application you have loaded jsii into.**\n\
  \n> The function `jsii.configureCategories()` is used to configure the severity (error, warning,\
  \ etc.) of various jsii diagnostics.\n\n**Impacted versions: <=5.7.2, <=5.6.3, <=5.5.14, <=5.4.45**\
  \ \n\n**Example:**\n\n```js\nconst jsii = require('jsii');\n\n// prints 'undefined'\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify({}.category))\n\
  \n// calling 'configureCategories' with user input\njsii.configureCategories(JSON.parse('{\"\
  __proto__\": \"user-input\"}'))\n\n// from this point onwards, every single object literal\
  \ in the program\n// will contain the 'category' key, with user controlled value\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify({}.category))\
  \ // prints 'user-input'\n\n\n// this can affect the execution of the main program in case\
  \ it also makes \n// use of an object key called 'category'. for example, if the main programs\
  \ \n// happens to have code like this:\n\nconst x = {} // some object in the main program\
  \ (not necessarily empty)\n\nif (x.category) {\n  // this block will always be executed, effectively\
  \ \n  // changing the behavior of the main program.\n  console.log('Do something')\n} else\
  \ {\n  console.log('Do something else')\n}\n```\n\nFor more information about javascript prototype\
  \ pollution, see [1].\n\n## Patches\n\nA patch is included in versions [5.7.3](https://github.com/aws/jsii-compiler/releases/tag/v5.7.3),\
  \ [5.6.4](https://github.com/aws/jsii-compiler/releases/tag/v5.6.4), [5.5.15](https://github.com/aws/jsii-compiler/releases/tag/v5.5.15),\
  \ [5.4.46](https://github.com/aws/jsii-compiler/releases/tag/v5.4.46)\n\n## Workarounds\n\n\
  Sanitize user input to configureCategories() by stripping the __proto__ property if detected.\n\
