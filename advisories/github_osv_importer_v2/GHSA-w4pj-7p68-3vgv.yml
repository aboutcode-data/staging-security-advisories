aliases:
  - CVE-2020-11083
summary: |
  Stored XSS in October
  ### Impact
  A user with access to a markdown FormWidget that stores data persistently could create a stored XSS attack against themselves and any other users with access to the generated HTML from the field.

  ### Patches
  Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466) & RainLab.Blog v1.4.1 by restricting the ability to store JS in markdown to only users that have been explicitly granted the `backend.allow_unsafe_markdown` permission.

  ### Workarounds
  Apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/9ecfb4867baae14a0d3f99f5b5c1e8a979ae8746 & https://github.com/rainlab/blog-plugin/commit/6ae19a6e16ef3ba730692bc899851342c858bb94 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 466 or v1.4.1 of RainLab.Blog (if using that plugin).
