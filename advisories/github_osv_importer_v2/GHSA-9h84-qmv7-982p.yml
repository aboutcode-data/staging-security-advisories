summary: |
  Helm Charts with Specific JSON Schema Values Can Cause Memory Exhaustion
  A Helm contributor discovered that it was possible to craft a JSON Schema file in a manner which could cause Helm to use all available memory and have an out of memory (OOM) termination.

  ### Impact
  A malicious chart can point `$ref` in _values.schema.json_ to a device (e.g. `/dev/*`) or other problem file which could cause Helm to use all available memory and have an out of memory (OOM) termination.

  ### Patches
  This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.5.

  ### Workarounds
  Make sure that all Helm charts that are being loaded into Helm doesn't have any reference of `$ref` pointing to `/dev/zero`.

  ### References
  Helm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.
