summary: |
  Hyperledger Fabric subject to Denial of Service via non-validated request
  A vulnerability exists in Hyperledger Fabric < 2.4 could allow an attacker to construct a non-validated request that could cause a denial of service attack.  The peer gateway service tries to extract channel and chaincode information from the signed proposal, but it doesn't check the proposal fields for validity. Therefore a malformed proposal might end up crashing the peer service. This issue has been patched in 2.4.6. There are no known workarounds.
