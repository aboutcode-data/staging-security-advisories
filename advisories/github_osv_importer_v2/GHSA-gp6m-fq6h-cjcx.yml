  Magento LTS vulnerable to stored XSS in admin file form
  ### Summary
  OpenMage is affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable form fields.

  ### Details
  `Mage_Adminhtml_Block_System_Config_Form_Field_File` does not escape filename value in certain situations.
  Same as: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20717

  ### PoC
  1. Create empty file with this filename: `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.crt`
  2. Go to _System_ > _Configuration_ > _Sales | Payment Methonds_.
  3. Click **Configure** on _PayPal Express Checkout_.
  4. Choose **API Certificate** from dropdown _API Authentication Methods_.
  5. Choose the XSS-file and click **Save Config**.
  6. Profit, alerts "1" -> XSS.
  7. Reload, alerts "1" -> Stored XSS.

  ### Impact
  Affects admins that have access to any fileupload field in admin in core or custom implementations.
  Malicious JavaScript may be executed in a victim’s browser when they browse to the page containing the vulnerable field.
