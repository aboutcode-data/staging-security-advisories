  - CVE-2026-25724
summary: "Claude Code has Permission Deny Bypass Through Symbolic Links\nClaude Code failed\
  \ to strictly enforce deny rules configured in settings.json when accessing files through\
  \ symbolic links. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access to a file (such as /etc/passwd)\
  \ and Claude Code had access to a symbolic link pointing to that file, it was possible for\
  \ Claude Code to read the restricted file through the symlink without triggering deny rule\
  \ enforcement. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically.\
  \ Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code\
  \ thanks https://hackerone.com/ofirh for reporting this issue."
