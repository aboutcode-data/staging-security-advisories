summary: |
  lakeFS is Missing Timestamp Validation in S3 Gateway Authentication
  ### Impact
  LakeFS's S3 gateway does not validate timestamps in authenticated requests, allowing replay attacks. An attacker who captures a valid signed request (e.g., through network interception, logs, or compromised systems) can replay that request until credentials are rotated, even after the request is intended to expire.

  ### Patches
  This issue affects all versions of lakeFS up to and including v1.74.4.

  The vulnerability has been fixed in version v1.75.0.

  Users should upgrade to version v1.75.0.

  ### Workarounds

  Until upgraded, implement these mitigations:

  - **Use short-lived credentials** - Rotate access keys frequently and **deactivate old keys**. For regular requests, captured requests only work until rotation. For presigned URLs, they remain valid until the credentials used to create them are deactivated.
  - **Network controls** - Restrict S3 gateway access to trusted networks/IPs to limit where replay attacks can originate.

  Note: These workarounds reduce risk but do not fully eliminate the vulnerability.
