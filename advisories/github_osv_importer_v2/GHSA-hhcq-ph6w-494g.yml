summary: "Shopware vulnerable to Improper Access Control with ManyToMany associations in store-api\n\
  ### Impact\n\nThe store-API works with regular entities and not expose all fields for the\
  \ public API; fields need to be marked as ApiAware in the EntityDefinition. So only ApiAware\
  \ fields of the EntityDefinition will be encoded to the final JSON. \n\nThe processing of\
  \ the Criteria did not considered ManyToMany associations and so they were not considered\
  \ properly and the protections didn't get used.\n\nThis issue cannot be reproduced with the\
  \ default entities by Shopware, but can be triggered with extensions.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate\
  \ to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.2, 6.3,  and\
  \ 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range\
  \ of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version."
