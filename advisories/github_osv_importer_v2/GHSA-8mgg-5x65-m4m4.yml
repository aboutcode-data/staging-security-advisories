  Command Injection in soletta-dev-app
  All versions of `soletta-dev-app` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `/api/service/status` API endpoint, passing contents of the `service` query parameter to an exec call. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
