  - CVE-2025-52999
summary: |
  jackson-core can throw a StackoverflowError when processing deeply nested data
  ### Impact
  With older versions  of jackson-core, if you parse an input file and it has deeply nested data, Jackson could end up throwing a StackoverflowError if the depth is particularly large.

  ### Patches
  jackson-core 2.15.0 contains a configurable limit for how deep Jackson will traverse in an input document, defaulting to an allowable depth of 1000. Change is in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/943. jackson-core will throw a StreamConstraintsException if the limit is reached.
  jackson-databind also benefits from this change because it uses jackson-core to parse JSON inputs.

  ### Workarounds
  Users should avoid parsing input files from untrusted sources.
