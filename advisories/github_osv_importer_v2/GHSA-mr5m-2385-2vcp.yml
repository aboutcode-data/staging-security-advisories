  - CVE-2020-11610
summary: |
  xdlocalstorage does not verify request origin
  An issue was discovered in xdLocalStorage through 2.0.5. The `postData()` function in `xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js` specifies the wildcard (`*`) as the targetOrigin when calling the `postMessage()` function on the parent object. Therefore any domain can load the application hosting the "magical iframe" and receive the messages that the "magical iframe" sends.
