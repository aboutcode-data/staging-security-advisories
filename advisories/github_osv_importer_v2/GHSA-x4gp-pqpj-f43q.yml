summary: |
  curve25519-dalek has timing variability in `curve25519-dalek`'s `Scalar29::sub`/`Scalar52::sub`
  Timing variability of any kind is problematic when working with  potentially secret values such as elliptic curve scalars, and such issues can potentially leak private keys and other secrets. Such a problem was recently discovered in `curve25519-dalek`.

  The `Scalar29::sub` (32-bit) and `Scalar52::sub` (64-bit) functions contained usage of a mask value inside a loop where LLVM saw an opportunity to insert a branch instruction (`jns` on x86) to conditionally bypass this code section when the mask value is set to zero as can be seen in godbolt:

  - 32-bit (see L106): https://godbolt.org/z/zvaWxzvqv
  - 64-bit (see L48): https://godbolt.org/z/PczYj7Pda

  A similar problem was recently discovered in the Kyber reference implementation:

  https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/hqbtIGFKIpU/m/cnE3pbueBgAJ

  As discussed on that thread, one portable solution, which is also used in this PR, is to introduce a volatile read as an optimization barrier, which prevents the compiler from optimizing it away.

  The fix can be validated in godbolt here:

  - 32-bit: https://godbolt.org/z/jc9j7eb8E
  - 64-bit: https://godbolt.org/z/x8d46Yfah

  The problem was discovered and the solution independently verified by Alexander Wagner <alexander.wagner@aisec.fraunhofer.de> and Lea Themint <lea.thiemt@tum.de> using their DATA tool:
