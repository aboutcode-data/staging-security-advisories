summary: "etcd vulnerable to TOCTOU of gateway endpoint authentication\n### Vulnerability type\n\
  Authentication\n\n### Workarounds\nRefer to the [gateway documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md).\
  \ The vulnerability was spotted due to unclear documentation of how the gateway handles endpoints\
  \ validation. \n\n### Detail\nThe gateway only authenticates endpoints detected from DNS SRV\
  \ records, and it only authenticates the detected endpoints once. Therefore, if an endpoint\
  \ changes its authentication settings, the gateway will continue to assume the endpoint is\
  \ still authenticated. The auditors has noted that appropriate documentation of this validation\
  \ functionality plus deprecation of this misleading functionality is an acceptable path forward.\n\
  \n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\
  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*\
