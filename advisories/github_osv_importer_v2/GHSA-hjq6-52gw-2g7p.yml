summary: |
  yt-dlp: `--exec` command injection when using `%q` in yt-dlp on Windows (Bypass of CVE-2023-40581)
  ### Summary
  The [patch that addressed CVE-2023-40581](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/de015e930747165dbb8fcd360f8775fd973b7d6e) attempted to prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` by replacing double quotes with two double quotes.
  However, this escaping is not sufficient, and still allows expansion of environment variables.

  Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version [2021.04.11](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2021.04.11).

  ### Patches
  yt-dlp version 2024.04.09 fixes this issue by properly escaping `%`. It replaces them with `%%cd:~,%`, a variable that expands to nothing, leaving only the leading percent.

  ### Workarounds
  It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2024.04.09 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using `--exec`, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous.

  For Windows users who are not able to upgrade:
  - Avoid using any output template expansion in `--exec` other than `{}` (filepath).
  - If expansion in `--exec` is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain `%`, `"`, `|` or `&`.
  - Instead of using `--exec`, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.

  ### Details
  When escaping variables, the following code is used for Windows.
  [`yt_dlp/compat/__init__.py` line 31-33](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/8e6e3651727b0b85764857fc6329fe5e0a3f00de/yt_dlp/compat/__init__.py#L31-L33)
  ```python
      def compat_shlex_quote(s):
          import re
          return s if re.match(r'^[-_\w./]+$', s) else s.replace('"', '""').join('""')
  ```
  It replaces `"` with `""` to balance out the quotes and keep quoting intact if non-allowed characters are included. However, the `%CMDCMDLINE%` variable can be used to generate a quote using `%CMDCMDLINE:~-1%`; since the value of `%CMDCMDLINE%` is the commandline with which `cmd.exe` was called, and it is always called with the command surrounded by quotes, `%CMDCMDLINE:~-1%` expands to `"`. After the quotes have been unbalanced, special characters are no longer quoted and commands can be executed:
  ```cmd
  %CMDCMDLINE:~-1%&calc.exe
  ```
