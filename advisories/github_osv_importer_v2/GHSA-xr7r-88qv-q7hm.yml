aliases:
  - CVE-2019-25001
summary: |
  Out of bounds write in serde_cbor
  Affected versions of this crate did not properly check if semantic tags were nested excessively during deserialization. This allows an attacker to craft small (< 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow. The flaw was corrected by limiting the allowed number of nested tags.
