  Improper Privilege Management in shelljs
  ### Impact
  Output from the synchronous version of `shell.exec()` may be visible to other users on the same system. You may be affected if you execute `shell.exec()` in multi-user Mac, Linux, or WSL environments, or if you execute `shell.exec()` as the root user.

  Other shelljs functions (including the asynchronous version of `shell.exec()`) are not impacted.

  ### Patches
  Patched in shelljs 0.8.5

  ### Workarounds
  Recommended action is to upgrade to 0.8.5.
