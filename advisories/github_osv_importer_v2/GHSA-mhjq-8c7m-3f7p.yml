summary: "Milvus Proxy has a Critical Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\n### Impact\n_What\
  \ kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nAn unauthenticated attacker can exploit\
  \ this vulnerability to bypass all authentication mechanisms in the Milvus Proxy component,\
  \ gaining full administrative access to the Milvus cluster.\nThis grants the attacker the\
  \ ability to read, modify, or delete data, and to perform privileged administrative operations\
  \ such as database or collection management.\nAll users running affected Milvus versions are\
  \ strongly advised to upgrade immediately.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?\
  \ What versions should users upgrade to?_\nThis issue has been fixed in the following versions:\n\
  \t•\tMilvus 2.4.24\n\t•\tMilvus 2.5.21\n\t•\tMilvus 2.6.5\n\nUsers should upgrade to these\
  \ patched versions or later to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a\
  \ way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nIf immediate upgrade\
  \ is not possible, a temporary mitigation can be applied by removing the sourceID header from\
  \ all incoming requests at the gateway, API gateway, or load balancer level before they reach\
  \ the Milvus Proxy.\nThis prevents attackers from exploiting the authentication bypass behavior.\n\
  \n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nThe following\
  \ pull requests contain the fixes for the affected Milvus branches:\n\t•\t[Fix for 2.4 branch](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/pull/45391)￼\n\
  \t•\t[Fix for 2.5 branch](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/pull/45383)￼\n\t•\t[Fix for\
  \ 2.6 branch](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/pull/45379)￼\n\nSpecial thanks to the Volcengine\
  \ Milvus team at ByteDance(liumingzhe.5689@bytedance.com) for responsibly discovering, reporting,\
  \ and coordinating the disclosure of this critical authentication bypass vulnerability with\
  \ the Milvus maintainers."
