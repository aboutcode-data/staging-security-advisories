summary: "Dapr API Token Exposure\n### **Summary**\n\nA vulnerability has been found in Dapr\
  \ that causes a leak of the application token of the invoker app to the invoked app when using\
  \ Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation. This issue arises because Dapr sends\
  \ the app token of the invoker app instead of the app token of the invoked app.\n\nUsers who\
  \ leverage Dapr for gRPC proxy service invocation and are using the app API token feature\
  \ are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to version [1.13.3](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.13.3).\
  \ \n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability impacts Dapr users who use Dapr as a gRPC proxy for\
  \ remote service invocation as well as the [Dapr App API token](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/app-api-token/)\
  \ functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the app token\
  \ of the invoker app, potentially compromising security and authentication mechanisms.\n\n\
  ### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in Dapr version [1.13.3](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.13.3).\n\
  \n### Details\n\nDapr uses two types of tokens for authentication:\n\n- `APP_API_TOKEN`: Used\
  \ by Dapr to authenticate to the app.\n- `DAPR_API_TOKEN`: Used by the app to authenticate\
  \ to Dapr.\n\nDapr uses the `dapr-api-token` metadata in gRPC calls (or header, for HTTP calls)\
  \ for authentication.\n\n- In communication from dapr to the app, the `dapr-api-token` metadata\
  \ field will carry the  `APP_API_TOKEN`.\n- In communication from the app to daprd, the `dapr-api-token`\
  \ metadata field will carry the  `DAPR_API_TOKEN`.\n\nBefore version 1.13.0, the `APP_API_TOKEN`\
  \ was not being sent to the invoked app for authentication, as reported in [this issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7344).\
  \ Instead, Dapr was incorrectly using the same `DAPR_API_TOKEN` that the invoker app had passed\
  \ to Dapr. This was addressed in [PR #7404](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/7404), but the\
  \ fix only worked for self-invocation scenarios.\n\nWhen Dapr needed to communicate with another\
  \ instance, it would mistakenly include the `APP_API_TOKEN` of the invoker app in the request.\
  \ This behavior is incorrect, app tokens should never be included in requests between Dapr\
  \ sidecars. This vulnerability allows the receiving app to see the app token of the invoker\
  \ app, leading to potential misuse and security breaches.\n\nThe vulnerability is addressed\
  \ by ensuring that Dapr uses the correct app token (of the invoked app) during gRPC proxy\
  \ service invocation.\n\n### References\n\n- https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/app-api-token/\n\

  ### Credits\n\nThanks to [Benjamin Delay](mailto:benjamin.delay@gmail.com) for reporting this\
  \ issue."
