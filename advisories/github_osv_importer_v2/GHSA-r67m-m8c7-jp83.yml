summary: "Cachet vulnerable to forced reinstall\n### Impact\n\nAuthenticated users, regardless\
  \ of their privileges (_User_ or _Admin_), can trick Cachet and install the instance again,\
  \ leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was addressed\
  \ by improving the middleware `ReadyForUse`, which now performs a stricter validation of the\
  \ instance name. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nOnly allow trusted source IP addresses to access to\
  \ the administration dashboard.\n\n### References\n\n- https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection\n\
