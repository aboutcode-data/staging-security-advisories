  Secret disclosure when containing characters that become URI encoded
  ### Impact

  Secrets that would normally be masked by `semantic-release` can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that become encoded when included in a URL.

  ### Patches

  Fixed in v17.2.3

  ### Workarounds

  Secrets that do not contain characters that become encoded when included in a URL are already masked properly.
