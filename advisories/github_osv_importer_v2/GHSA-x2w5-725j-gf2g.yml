  - CVE-2022-22143
summary: "Prototype Pollution in convict\n### Impact\n\n* An attacker can inject attributes\
  \ that are used in other components\n* An attacker can override existing attributes with ones\
  \ that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash.\n\nThe main use case of Convict\
  \ is for handling server-side configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and\
  \ not random users. So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server.\
  \ Still a situation can happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be\
  \ tricked by an attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nThe problem is patched in `convict@6.2.3`. Users should upgrade to `convict@6.2.3`.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nNo way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading\n\
  \n### References\n\n* https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-convict/\n* #384\n* 3b86be087d8f14681a9c889d45da7fe3ad9cd880\n\
  * 1ea0ab19c5208f66509e1c43b0d0f21c1fd29b75\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any\
  \ questions or comments about this advisory: \nadd your question as a comment in #384"
