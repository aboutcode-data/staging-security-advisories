aliases:
  - CVE-2026-27593
summary: |
  Statamic is vulnerable to account takeover via password reset link injection
  ## Impact

  An attacker may leverage a vulnerability in the password reset feature to capture a user's token and reset the password on their behalf.

  The attacker must know the email address of a valid account on the site, and the actual user must blindly click the link in their email even though they didn't request the reset.

  ## Patches

  This has been fixed in 6.3.3 and 5.73.10.
