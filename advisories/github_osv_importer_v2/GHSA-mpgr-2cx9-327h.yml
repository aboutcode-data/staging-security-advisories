  - CVE-2020-4045
summary: |
  Information disclosure in SSB-DB
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Servers running SSB-DB 20.0.0 (which is packaged with SSB-Server 16.0.0) must upgrade immediately.

  **There is no evidence that other SSB apps are vulnerable or that this problem has been exploited in the wild.**

  The `get()` method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there's a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it's returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around `get()` to anonymous peers.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Yes, please upgrade to SSB-DB 20.0.1 (or SSB-Server 16.0.1) immediately.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  You may be able to disable the most obvious attack vector, SSB-OOO, by disabling the plugin, but you should upgrade immediately anyway.
