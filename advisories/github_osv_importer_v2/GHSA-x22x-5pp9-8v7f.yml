aliases:
  - CVE-2024-23905
summary: |
  Content-Security-Policy disabled by Red Hat Dependency Analytics Jenkins Plugin
  Jenkins sets the Content-Security-Policy header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically DirectoryBrowserSupport), such as workspaces, /userContent, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

  Red Hat Dependency Analytics Plugin 0.7.1 and earlier globally disables the Content-Security-Policy header for static files served by Jenkins whenever the 'Invoke Red Hat Dependency Analytics (RHDA)' build step is executed. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.
