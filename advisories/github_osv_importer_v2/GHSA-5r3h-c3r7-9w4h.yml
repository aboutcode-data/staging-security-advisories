summary: "Apache Pulsar Disabled Certificate Validation for OAuth Client Credential Requests\
  \ makes C++/Python Clients vulnerable to MITM attack\nThe Apache Pulsar C++ Client does not\
  \ verify peer TLS certificates when making HTTPS calls for the OAuth2.0 Client Credential\
  \ Flow, even when `tlsAllowInsecureConnection` is disabled via configuration. This vulnerability\
  \ allows an attacker to perform a man in the middle attack and intercept and/or modify the\
  \ GET request that is sent to the `ClientCredentialFlow` \"issuer url\". The intercepted credentials\
  \ can be used to acquire authentication data from the OAuth2.0 server to then authenticate\
  \ with an Apache Pulsar cluster. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability\
  \ by taking control of a machine \"between\" the client and the server. The attacker must\
  \ then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack. The Apache Pulsar Python Client\
  \ wraps the C++ client, so it is also vulnerable in the same way. \n\nThis issue affects Apache\
  \ Pulsar C++ Client and Python Client versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2;\
  \ 2.10.0 to 2.10.1; 2.6.4 and earlier. \n\nAny users running affected versions of the C++\
  \ Client or the Python Client should rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials, including `client_id`\
  \ and `client_secret`. \n- 2.7 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.7.5 and rotate\
  \ vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. \n- 2.8 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.8.4\
  \ and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. \n- 2.9 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade\
  \ to 2.9.3 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. \n- 2.10 C++ and Python Client users\
  \ should upgrade to 2.10.2 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. 3.0 C++ users are unaffected\
  \ and 3.0 Python Client users will be unaffected when it is released. \n- Any users running\
  \ the C++ and Python Client for 2.6 or less should upgrade to one of the above patched versions."
