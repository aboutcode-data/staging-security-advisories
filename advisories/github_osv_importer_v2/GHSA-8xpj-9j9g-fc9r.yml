aliases:
  - CVE-2022-24827
summary: |
  SQL Injection in elide-datastore-aggregation
  ### Impact
  When leveraging the following together:

  - Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries
  - Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter)
  - A parameterized column of type TEXT

  There is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection.  A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns.  This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters.

  ### Patches
  A [fix](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/pull/2581) is provided in [Elide 6.1.4](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/releases/tag/6.1.4).

  ### Workarounds
  The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted).   Workarounds include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns.
