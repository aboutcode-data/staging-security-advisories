  - CVE-2026-25725
summary: "Claude Code has Sandbox Escape via Persistent Configuration Injection in settings.json\n\
  Claude Code's bubblewrap sandboxing mechanism failed to properly protect the .claude/settings.json\
  \ configuration file when it did not exist at startup. While the parent directory was mounted\
  \ as writable and .claude/settings.local.json was explicitly protected with read-only constraints,\
  \ settings.json was not protected if it was missing. This allowed malicious code running inside\
  \ the sandbox to create this file and inject persistent hooks (such as SessionStart commands)\
  \ that would execute with host privileges when Claude Code was restarted. \n\nUsers on standard\
  \ Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates\
  \ are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks hackerone.com/edbr for\
  \ reporting this issue!"
