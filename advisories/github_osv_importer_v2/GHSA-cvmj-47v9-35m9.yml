  FUSE-Rust: Uninitalized memory read and leak caused by fuser crate
  During the creation of a new libfuse session with `fuse_session_new`, the operation list was passed as NULL incorrectly. libfuse expects this argument to always point to list of operations. This caused uninitialized memory read and leaks in libfuse.so.
