summary: "Koa Vulnerable to Open Redirect via Trailing Double-Slash (//) in back Redirect Logic\n\
  ### Summary:\n\nA bypass was discovered in the `Koa.js` framework affecting its back redirect\
  \ functionality. In certain circumstances, an attacker can manipulate the Referer header to\
  \ force a user’s browser to navigate to an external, potentially malicious website. This occurs\
  \ because the implementation incorrectly treats some specially crafted URLs as safe relative\
  \ paths. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow attackers to perform phishing, social engineering,\
  \ or other redirect-based attacks on users of affected applications.\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ affects the code referenced in GitHub Advisory GHSA-jgmv-j7ww-jx2x (which is tracked as\
  \ CVE‑2025‑54420). \n\n### Details:\nThe patched code attempts to treat values that `startWith('/')`\
  \ as safe relative paths and only perform origin checks for absolute URLs. However, protocol‑relative\
  \ URLs (those beginning with //host) also start with '/' and therefore match the startsWith('/')\
  \ branch. A protocol‑relative referrer such as `//evil.com` with trailing double-slash is\
  \ treated by the implementation as a safe relative path, but browsers interpret Location:\
  \ //evil.com as a redirect to https://evil.com (or http:// based on context).\nThis discrepancy\
  \ allows an attacker to supply Referer: //evil.com and trigger an external redirect - bypassing\
  \ the intended same‑origin protection.\n\n### Proof of concept (PoC):\nAffected line of code:\
  \ https://github.com/koajs/koa/blob/master/lib/response.js#L326\nThe problematic logic looks\
  \ like:\n\n<img width=\"567\" height=\"509\" alt=\"3\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33de440a-8945-4e5f-9e0a-2011a3999458\"\
  \ />\n\nRequest with a protocol‑relative Referer:\ncurl -i -H \"Referer: //haymiz.dev\" http://127.0.0.1:3000/test\n\
  \n<img width=\"2072\" height=\"1005\" alt=\"1\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c48c79-559d-46aa-8b76-c1d2d3536c8b\"\
  \ />\n\nVulnerable response will contain:\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: //haymiz.dev\n\n\
  A browser receiving that Location header navigates to https://haymiz.dev (or http:// depending\
  \ on context), resulting in an open redirect to an attacker‑controlled host:\n\n<img width=\"\
  454\" height=\"239\" alt=\"2\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/852ae81a-9f63-49c1-9ce5-72cd96bcea68\"\
  \ />\n\n### Recommendation / Patch:\n* Do not treat //host as a safe relative path. Explicitly\
  \ exclude protocol‑relative values from any relative‑path branch.\n* Normalize the Referer\
  \ by resolving it with a base (e.g., new URL(rawRef, ctx.href)), then compare resolved.origin\
  \ (scheme+host+port) to ctx.origin (or ctx.host plus scheme/port) before allowing the redirect.\n\
  \n### Impact:\nAn attacker who can cause a victim to visit a specially crafted link (or inject\
  \ a request with a controlled Referer) can cause the victim to be redirected to an attacker‑controlled\
  \ domain. This can be used for phishing, social engineering, or to bypass some protection\
  \ rules that rely on same‑origin navigation."
