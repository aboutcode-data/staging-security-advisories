summary: "XSS/CSRF Remote Code Execution in XWiki.ConfigurableClass\n### Impact\n \nThere is\
  \ a reflected XSS or also direct remote code execution vulnerability in the code for displaying\
  \ configurable admin sections. The code that can be passed through a URL parameter is only\
  \ executed when the user who is visiting the crafted URL has edit right on at least one configuration\
  \ section. While any user of the wiki could easily create such a section, in this case it\
  \ is much more convenient to exploit [GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5)\
  \ which is why this attack scenario won't be further considered in the following. In contrast\
  \ to GHSA-qj86-p74r-7wp5, this vulnerability doesn't require the attacker to have an account\
  \ or any access on the wiki. It is sufficient to trick any admin user of the XWiki installation\
  \ to visit the crafted URL. Alternatively, the URL can also be embedded as image source of\
  \ an image in any content of the wiki like a comment that could be left by an anonymous user.\
  \ This vulnerability allows full remote code execution with programming rights and thus impacts\
  \ the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\n###\
  \ Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.2 and 15.7RC1\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nThe [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5e14c8d08fd0c5b619833d35090b470aa4cb52b0#diff-bf419a99140f3c12fd78ea30f855b63cfb74c1c976ff4436898266d9b37ad3ce)\
  \ can be manually applied to the document `XWiki.ConfigurableClass`.\n\n### References\n\n\
