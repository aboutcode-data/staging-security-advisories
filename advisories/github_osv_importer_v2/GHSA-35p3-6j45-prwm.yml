summary: |
  Aim Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability
  A vulnerability in aimhubio/aim version 3.25.0 allows for a denial of service (DoS) attack. The issue arises when a large number of tracked metrics are retrieved simultaneously from the Aim web API, causing the web server to become unresponsive. The root cause is the lack of a limit on the number of metrics that can be requested per call, combined with the server's single-threaded nature, leading to excessive resource consumption and blocking of the server.
