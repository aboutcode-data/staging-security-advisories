summary: "Fleet has an SQL Injection vulnerability via backtick escape in ORDER BY parameter\n\
  ### Summary\n\nA SQL Injection vulnerability in Fleet’s software versions API allowed authenticated\
  \ users to inject arbitrary SQL expressions via the `order_key` query parameter. Due to unsafe\
  \ use of `goqu.I()` when constructing the `ORDER BY` clause, specially crafted input could\
  \ escape identifier quoting and be interpreted as executable SQL.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn authenticated\
  \ attacker with access to the affected endpoint could inject SQL expressions into the underlying\
  \ MySQL query. Although the injection occurs in an `ORDER BY` context, it is sufficient to\
  \ enable blind SQL injection techniques that can disclose database information through conditional\
  \ expressions that affect result ordering. Crafted expressions may also cause excessive computation\
  \ or query failures, potentially leading to degraded performance or denial of service.\n\n\
  No direct evidence of reliable data modification or stacked query execution was demonstrated.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate upgrade is not possible, users should restrict access\
  \ to the affected endpoint to trusted roles only and ensure that any user-supplied sort or\
  \ column parameters are strictly allow-listed at the application or proxy layer.\n\n### For\
  \ more information\n\nIf there are any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail\
  \ fleet at [security@fleetdm.com](mailto:security@fleetdm.com)  \nJoin #fleet in [osquery\
  \ Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw)\n\
