summary: "JWT token compromise can allow malicious actions including Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n\
  ### Impact \n\nA user can reverse engineer the JWT token (JSON Web Token) used in authentication\
  \ for Manager and API access, forging a valid NeuVector Token to perform malicious activity\
  \ in NeuVector. This can lead to an RCE. \n\n### Patches \n\nUpgrade to NeuVector [version\
  \ 5.2.2](https://open-docs.neuvector.com/releasenotes/5x) or later and latest Helm chart (2.6.3+).\
  \ \n+ In 5.2.2 the certificate for JWT-signing is created automatically by controller with\
  \ validity of 90days and rotated automatically.\n+ Use Helm-based deployment/upgrade to 5.2.2\
  \ to generate a unique certificate for Manager, REST API, ahd registry adapter. Helm based\
  \ installation/upgrade is required in order to automatically generate certificates upon initial\
  \ installation and each subsequent upgrade. \n+ See [release notes](https://open-docs.neuvector.com/releasenotes/5x)\
  \ for manual/yaml based deployment advice.\n+ 5.2.2 also implements additional protections\
  \ against possible RCE for the feature of custom compliance scripts. \n\n### Workarounds \n\
  \nUsers can replace the Manager & Controller certificate manually by following the instructions\
  \ in documented [here](https://open-docs.neuvector.com/configuration/console/replacecert).\
  \ However, upgrading to 5.2.2 and replacing Manager/REST API certificate is recommended to\
  \ provide additional security enhancements to prevent possible attempted exploit and resulting\
  \ RCE. See [release notes](https://open-docs.neuvector.com/releasenotes/5x) for additional\
  \ details.\n\n### Credits \n\nThank you to [Dejan Zelic](https://dejandayoff.com/) at [Offensive\
  \ Security](https://www.offsec.com/) for responsibly reporting this vulnerability. \n\n###\
