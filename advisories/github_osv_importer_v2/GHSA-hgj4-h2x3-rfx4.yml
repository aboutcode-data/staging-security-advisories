summary: "Sentry vulnerable to incorrect credential validation on OAuth token requests\n###\
  \ Impact\n\nAn attacker with sufficient client-side exploits could retrieve a valid access\
  \ token for another user during the OAuth token exchange due to incorrect credential validation.\
  \ The client ID must be known and the API application must have already been authorized on\
  \ the targeted user account. \n\n### Remediation\n\n- **Sentry SaaS** customers do not need\
  \ to take any action. Those with the highest risk will be contacted directly by Sentry.\n\
  - **Self-hosted installations** should upgrade to version 23.7.2 or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nThere are no direct workarounds, but users should review applications authorized on their\
  \ account (_User Settings > Authorized Applications_) and remove any that are no longer needed."
