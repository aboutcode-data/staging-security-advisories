  Duplicate Advisory: gix-transport code execution vulnerability
  ### Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-rrjw-j4m2-mf34. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ### Original Description
  The gix-transport crate before 0.36.1 for Rust allows command execution via the "gix clone 'ssh://-oProxyCommand=open$IFS" substring. NOTE: this was discovered before CVE-2024-32884, a similar vulnerability (involving a username field) that is more difficult to exploit.
