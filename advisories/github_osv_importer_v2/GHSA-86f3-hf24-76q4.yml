summary: |
  Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key in Netmaker
  ### Impact
  There is a hard-coded cryptographic key in the code base which can be exploited to run admin commands on a remote server, if you know the address and username of the admin. This effects the server (netmaker) component, and not clients.

  ### Patches
  This has been patched in Netmaker v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0. If you are running these versions, the fix is to perform the following:

  1. docker-compose down
  2. docker pull gravitl/netmaker:( version )
  3. docker-compose up -d

  #### Additional Information
  If you are running **any other version**, you will need to upgrade to one of these three versions. If you have a special circumstance that requires running a different version, let us know and we may be able to build a custom patch.
