aliases:
  - CVE-2024-34073
summary: |
  sagemaker-python-sdk Command Injection vulnerability
  ### Impact

  The capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils` module before version 2.214.3 allows for potentially unsafe Operating System (OS) Command Injection if inappropriate command is passed as the “requirements_path” parameter. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity.

  Impacted versions: <2.214.3

  ### Credit

  We would like to thank HiddenLayer for collaborating on this issue through the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.

  ### Workarounds

  Do not override the “requirements_path” parameter of capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils`, instead use the default value.
