summary: |
  Rancher allows privilege escalation in Windows nodes due to Insecure Access Control Lists
  ### Impact

  A vulnerability has been identified whereby Rancher Manager deployments containing Windows nodes have weak Access Control Lists (ACL), allowing `BUILTIN\Users` or `NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users` to view or edit sensitive files which could lead to privilege escalation.

  The affected files include binaries, scripts, configuration and log files:

  ```
  C:\etc\rancher\wins\config
  C:\var\lib\rancher\agent\rancher2_connection_info.json
  C:\etc\rancher\rke2\config.yaml.d\50-rancher.yaml
  C:\var\lib\rancher\agent\applied\*-*-applied.plan
  C:\usr\local\bin\rke2
  C:\var\lib\rancher\capr\idempotence\idempotent.sh
  ```

  RKE2 nodes expand the list to include the files below:

  ```
  C:\etc\rancher\node\password
  C:\var\lib\rancher\rke2\agent\logs\kubelet.log
  C:\var\lib\rancher\rke2\data\v1.**.**-rke2r*-windows-amd64-*\bin\*
  C:\var\lib\rancher\rke2\bin\*
  ```

  **This vulnerability is exclusive to deployments that contain Windows nodes. Linux-only environments are not affected by it.**

  Please consult the associated [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/) for further information about this category of attack.

  ### Patches

  Patched versions include Rancher Manager `2.8.9` and `2.9.3`. For RKE2 Windows nodes, please refer to its [specific advisory](https://github.com/rancher/rke2/security/advisories/GHSA-x7xj-jvwp-97rv). No patches are available for 2.7, therefore users are urged to upgrade to newer minor versions or to apply the manual workaround below.


  ### Workarounds

  Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version of Rancher Manager. When that is not possible, users can enforce stricter ACLs for all sensitive files affected by this Security Advisory running [this](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/blob/master/windows-access-control-lists/README.md) PowerShell script as an Administrator on each node.
