  Session Middleware Token Injection Vulnerability
  A security vulnerability has been identified in the Fiber session middleware where a user can supply their own session_id value, leading to the creation of a session with that key.

  ## Impact
  The identified vulnerability is a session middleware issue in GoFiber versions 2 and above. This vulnerability allows users to supply their own session_id value, resulting in the creation of a session with that key. If a website relies on the mere presence of a session for security purposes, this can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and session fixation attacks. All users utilizing GoFiber's session middleware in the affected versions are impacted.

  ## Patches
  The issue has been addressed in the latest patch. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.52.5 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability.

  ## Workarounds
  Users who are unable to upgrade immediately can apply the following workarounds to reduce the risk:

  1. **Validate Session IDs**: Implement additional validation to ensure session IDs are not supplied by the user and are securely generated by the server.
  2. **Session Management**: Regularly rotate session IDs and enforce strict session expiration policies.
