summary: "Froxlor has an HTML Injection Vulnerability\n### Summary\n_An HTML Injection vulnerability\
  \ in the customer account portal allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML payloads in the\
  \ email section. This can lead to phishing attacks, credential theft, and reputational damage\
  \ by redirecting users to malicious external websites. The vulnerability has a medium severity,\
  \ as it can be exploited through user input without authentication._\n\n### Observation\n\
  _It is observed that in the portal of the customer account, there is a functionality in the\
  \ email section to create an email address that accepts user input. By intercepting the request\
  \ and modifying the \"domain\" field with an HTML injection payload containing an anchor tag,\
  \ the injected payload is reflected on an error page. When clicked, it redirects users to\
  \ an external website, confirming the presence of an HTML Injection vulnerability._\n\n###\
  \ PoC\n1. Navigate to the Email section in the Customer Account Portal and create a new email\
  \ address.\n\n2. Enter any garbage value in the required field and intercept the request using\
  \ Burp Suite.\n\n3. Locate the \"domain\" field in the intercepted request and replace its\
  \ value with the following HTML Injection payload:\n\n\t`<a href=\"&#x68;&#x74;&#x74;&#x70;&#x73;&#x3a;&#x2f;&#x2f;&#x77;&#x77;&#x77;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#x67;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;\"\
  >CLiCK</a>`\n\n4. Forward the modified request and observe that the injected payload is reflected\
  \ on an error page.\n\n5. Click on the displayed \"CLiCK\" link to verify that it redirects\
  \ to `https://www.google.com`, confirming the presence of HTML [Injection.]([url]([froxlor_HTML-INJECTION.mp4.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18311429/froxlor_HTML-INJECTION.mp4.zip)))\n\
  \n### Impact\n_An attacker can exploit this HTML Injection vulnerability to manipulate the\
  \ portal’s content, conduct phishing attacks, deface the application, or trick users into\
  \ clicking malicious links. This can lead to credential theft, malware distribution, reputational\
  \ damage, and potential compliance violations.\nThe users of the customer account portal are\
  \ impacted by this vulnerability. Specifically, any user who interacts with the email section\
  \ of the portal may be tricked into clicking malicious links, leading to potential phishing\
  \ attacks, credential theft, and exposure to other malicious activities. The organization\
  \ hosting the portal could also be impacted by reputational damage and compliance violations._\n\
  \n### Recommendation\n_It is recommended to implement proper input validation and output encoding\
  \ to prevent HTML Injection. The application should sanitize user input by stripping or escaping\
  \ HTML tags before rendering it on the page._"
