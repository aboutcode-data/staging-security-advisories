summary: |
  Jenkins RQM Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs due to missing permission check
  Jenkins RQM Plugin 2.8 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint. This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
