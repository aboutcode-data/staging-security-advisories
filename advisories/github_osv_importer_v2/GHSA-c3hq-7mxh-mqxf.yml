  Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution in lighter-vm
  All versions of `lighter-vm` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context through `this.constructor.constructor` . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. Evaluating the payload `this.constructor.constructor('return process.env')()` prints the contents of `process.env`.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
