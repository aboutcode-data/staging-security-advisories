  - CVE-2023-49283
summary: "Test code in published microsoft-graph-core package exposes phpinfo()\n### Impact\n\
  \nThe Microsoft Graph Core PHP SDK published packages which contained test code that enabled\
  \ the use of the phpInfo() function from any application that could access and execute the\
  \ file at vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php.  The phpInfo function\
  \ exposes system information. \n\nThe vulnerability affects the GetPhpInfo.php script of the\
  \ PHP SDK which contains a call to the phpinfo() function.  \n\nThis vulnerability requires\
  \ a misconfiguration of the server to be present so it can be exploited. For example, making\
  \ the PHP application’s /vendor directory web accessible.  \n\nThe combination of the vulnerability\
  \ and the server misconfiguration would allow an attacker to craft an HTTP request that executes\
  \ the phpinfo() method. The attacker would then be able to get access to system information\
  \ like configuration, modules, and environment variables and later on use the compromised\
  \ secrets to access additional data.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been patched in version\
  \ 2.0.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate deployment with the updated vendor package\
  \ is not available, you can perform the following temporary workarounds:\n- delete the vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php\
  \ file\n- remove access to the /vendor directory will remove this vulnerability\n- disable\
  \ the phpinfo function\n\n### References\nFor more information about the vulnerability and\
  \ the patch, users can refer to the following sources: \n\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49103\n\
