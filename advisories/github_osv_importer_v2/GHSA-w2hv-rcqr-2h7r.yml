summary: |
  View name validation bypass in Jenkins
  Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier does not properly check that a newly created view has an allowed name. When a form to create a view is submitted, the name is included twice in the submission. One instance is validated, but the other instance is used to create the value.

  This allows attackers with View/Create permission to create views with invalid or already-used names.

  Jenkins 2.287, LTS 2.277.2 uses the same submitted value for validation and view creation.
