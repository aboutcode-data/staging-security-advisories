  Prototype Pollution in ali-security/mongoose
  ### Impact
  This vulnerability causes a Prototype Pollution in document.js, through functions such as findByIdAndUpdate().
  For applications using Express and EJS, this can potentially allow remote code execution.

  ### Patches
  The original patched version for mongoose 5.3.3 did not include a fix for CVE-2023-3696. Therefore the existing version @seal-security/mongoose-fixed version 5.3.3 is affected by this vulnerability (though it is protected from CVE-2022-2564 and CVE-2019-17426). To mitigate this issue, a @seal-security/mongoose-fixed version 5.3.4 has been deployed. Note that this version is compatible with the original mongoose version 5.3.3, not version 5.3.4
