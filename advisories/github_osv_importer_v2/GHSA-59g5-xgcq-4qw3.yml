  - CVE-2024-53981
summary: "Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary\n### Summary\n\
  \nWhen parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front\
  \ of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte\
  \ at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain\
  \ inputs.\n\nAn attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data\
  \ before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing\
  \ thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the\
  \ event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service\
  \ (DoS).\n\n### Impact\n\nApplications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or\
  \ use frameworks that do so) are affected. \n\n### Original Report\n\nThis security issue\
  \ was reported by:\n- GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck\n\
