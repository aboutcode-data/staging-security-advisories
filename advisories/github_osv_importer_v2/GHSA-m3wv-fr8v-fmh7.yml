  - CVE-2017-1000387
summary: |
  Jenkins Build-Publisher plugin has Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  Jenkins Build-Publisher plugin version 1.21 and earlier stores credentials to other Jenkins instances in the file `hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml` in the Jenkins master home directory. These credentials were stored unencrypted, allowing anyone with local file system access to access them. Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations. Build-Publisher Plugin 1.22 encrypts the credentials on disk, and only transmits their encrypted form to users viewing the configuration form.
