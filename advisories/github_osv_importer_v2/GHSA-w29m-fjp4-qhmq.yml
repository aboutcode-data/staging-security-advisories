aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5230
summary: |
  Unsafe Identifiers in Opencast
  ### Impact

  Opencast allows almost arbitrary identifiers for media packages and
  elements to be used. This can be problematic for operation and security
  since such identifiers are sometimes used for file system operations
  which may lead to an attacker being able to escape working directories and
  write files to other locations.

  In addition, Opencast's Id.toString(…) vs Id.compact(…) behavior,
  the latter trying to mitigate some of the file system problems, can
  cause errors due to identifier mismatch since an identifier may
  unintentionally change.

  ### Patches

  This issue is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and 8.1.

  ### Workarounds

  There is no workaround for this.
