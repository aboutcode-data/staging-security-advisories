summary: "NeuVector telemetry sender is vulnerable to MITM and DoS\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability\
  \ affects NeuVector deployments only when the `Report anonymous cluster data option` is enabled.\
  \ When this option is enabled, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry data to the telemetry server\
  \ at `https://upgrades.neuvector-upgrade-responder.livestock.rancher.io`.\n\nIn affected versions,\
  \ NeuVector does not enforce TLS certificate verification when transmitting anonymous cluster\
  \ data to the telemetry server. As a result, the communication channel is susceptible to man-in-the-middle\
  \ (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept or modify the transmitted data. Additionally,\
  \ NeuVector loads the response of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size\
  \ limitation, which makes  it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS) attack. \n\nThe patched\
  \ version includes the following security improvements:\n- NeuVector now verifies the telemetry\
  \ server’s `TLS certificate chain` and `hostname` during the handshake process. This ensures\
  \ that all telemetry communications occur over a trusted and verified channel.\n- NeuVector\
  \ limits the telemetry server’s response to `256 bytes`, mitigating the risk of memory exhaustion\
  \ and DoS attacks.\n\nThese security enhancements are enabled by default and require no user\
  \ action.\n\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions include release **v5.4.7** and above.\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\nIf you cannot update to a patched version, you can temporarily disable the\
  \ Report anonymous cluster data, which is enabled by default in NeuVector.\nTo change this\
  \ setting, go to **Settings** → **Configuration** → **Report anonymous cluster data** in the\
  \ NeuVector UI.\n\nDisabling this option prevents NeuVector from sending telemetry data to\
  \ the telemetry server, which helps mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n\n### References\nIf you\
  \ have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security\
  \ team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n\
