aliases:
  - CVE-2019-16779
summary: |
  In RubyGem excon, interrupted Persistent Connections May Leak Response Data
  ### Impact
  There was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.

  ### Patches
  The problem has been patched in 0.71.0, users should upgrade to this or a newer version (if one exists).

  ### Workarounds
  Users can workaround the problem by disabling persistent connections, though this may cause performance implications.

  ### References
  See the [patch](https://github.com/excon/excon/commit/ccb57d7a422f020dc74f1de4e8fb505ab46d8a29) for further details.
