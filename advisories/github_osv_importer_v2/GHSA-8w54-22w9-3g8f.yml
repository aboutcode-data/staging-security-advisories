  Cross-site Scripting and Open Redirect in Products.CMFPlone
  ### Impact
  Plone is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish.
  The technique is known as cache poisoning.
  Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page.
  Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on your cache settings.

  ### Patches
  No patch is available for the Products.CMFPlone 4 series.
  Versions 5.0 and higher are not affected, but two other packages used by these versions are affected.

  `plone.app.contenttypes` has the same problem in all versions, see [advisory](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/security/advisories/GHSA-f7qw-5fgj-247x).
  In Plone 5.0-5.2, the default Products.ATContentTypes version has the same problem. See [advisory](https://github.com/plone/Products.ATContentTypes/security/advisories/GHSA-g4c2-ghfg-g5rh).
  Plone 5.2.7 and 6.0.0a3 will be released today and will include these fixes.

  For all unpatched versions of the three packages, you can use the following workaround.

  ### Workaround
  Make sure the image_view_fullscreen page is not stored in the cache.
  In Plone:

  * Login as Manager and go to Site Setup.
  * Go to the 'Caching' control panel. If this does not exist, or 'Enable caching' is not checked, you should normally not be vulnerable.
  * Click on the tab 'Caching operations'.
  * Under 'Legacy template mappings' locate the ruleset 'Content item view'.
  * From the last column ('Templates')  remove 'image_view_fullscreen'.
  * Click on Save.
