aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31670
summary: |
  ### Impact
   Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating tag retention policies. API call:

    PUT /retentions/{id}

  By sending a request to update a tag retention policy with an id that belongs to a project
  that the currently authenticated user doesn’t have access to, the attacker could modify
  tag retention policies configured in other projects.

  ### Patches
  This and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no workarounds available.
