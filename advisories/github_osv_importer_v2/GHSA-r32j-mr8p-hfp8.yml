  Silverstripe XSS in TreeDropdownField and TreeMultiSelectField
  A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the TreeDropdownField and TreeMultiSelectField.

  This vulnerability can only be exploited if a user with CMS access has posted malicious or unescaped HTML into any of the dataobjects used as a data source for either of these fields.

  This has been resolved by ensuring that all dataobjects used as a data source have their content safely encoded.
