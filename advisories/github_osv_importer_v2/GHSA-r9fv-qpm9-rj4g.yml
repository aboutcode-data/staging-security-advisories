  Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in Elasticsearch
  Elasticsearch Alerting and Monitoring in versions before 6.4.1 or 5.6.12 have an information disclosure issue when secrets are configured via the API.

This could allow an authenticated Elasticsearch user to improperly view these details.
