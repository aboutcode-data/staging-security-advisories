  - CVE-2024-47877
summary: |
  Extract has insufficient checks allowing attacker to create symlinks outside the extraction directory.
  ### Impact
  A maliciously crafted archive may allow an attacker to create a symlink outside the extraction target directory.

  ### Patches
  Please use version 4.0.0 or later `github.com/codeclysm/extract/v4`. Any previous version is affected by the bug.

  ### Workarounds
  No knows workarounds.

  ### Backward compatibility notes about upgrading to `/v4` from `/v3`

  If you're not using the `extract.Extractor.FS` interface, you will not face any breaking changes and upgrading should be as simple as changing the import to `/v4`. This should be the case for most of the userbase.

  If you're using the `Extractor.FS` interface, then upgrading to `/v4` will require to implement the new methods that have been added:

  ```go
  type FS interface {
      Link(string, string) error
      MkdirAll(string, os.FileMode) error
      OpenFile(name string, flag int, perm os.FileMode) (*os.File, error)
      Symlink(string, string) error

      // The following methods have been added in the /v4 interface:

      Remove(path string) error
      Stat(name string) (os.FileInfo, error)
      Chmod(name string, mode os.FileMode) error
  }
  ```

  There should be no other breaking changes in the `/v4` API.
