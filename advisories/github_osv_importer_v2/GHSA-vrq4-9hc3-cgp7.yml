aliases:
  - CVE-2025-32428
summary: |
  TigerVNC accessible via the network and not just via a UNIX socket as intended
  ## Summary

  `jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy` was meant to rely on UNIX sockets readable only by the current user since version 3.0.0, but when used with TigerVNC, the VNC server started by `jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy` were still accessible via the network.

  This vulnerability does not affect users having TurboVNC as the `vncserver` executable.

  ## Credits

  This vulnerability was identified by Arne Gottwald at University of Göttingen and analyzed, reported, and reviewed by @frejanordsiek.
