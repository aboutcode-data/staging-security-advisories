aliases:
  - CVE-2025-30148
summary: |
  Silverstripe Framework has a XSS vulnerability in HTML editor
  ### Impact

  A bad actor with access to edit content in the CMS could send a specifically crafted encoded payload to the server, which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The payload would be sanitised on the client-side, but server-side sanitisation doesn't catch it.

  The server-side sanitisation logic has been updated to sanitise against this attack.
