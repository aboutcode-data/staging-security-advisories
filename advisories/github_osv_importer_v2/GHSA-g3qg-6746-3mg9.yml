  - CVE-2025-52484
summary: "zkVM Underconstrained Vulnerability\nDue to a missing constraint in the rv32im circuit,\
  \ any 3-register RISC-V instruction (including remu and divu) in risc0-zkvm 2.0.0, 2.0.1,\
  \ and 2.0.2 are vulnerable to an attack by a malicious prover. The main idea for the attack\
  \ is to confuse the RISC-V virtual machine into treating the value of the rs1 register as\
  \ the same as the rs2 register due to a lack of constraints in the rv32im circuit.\n\nThis\
  \ vulnerability was reported by Christoph Hochrainer via our Hackenproof bug bounty. We have\
  \ evaluated the severity of the vulnerability as “Critical,” and paid a bounty. \n\nThe fix\
  \ for the circuit was implemented in [zirgen/pull/238](https://github.com/risc0/zirgen/pull/238),\
  \ and the update to risc0 was implemented in [risc0/pull/3181](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/pull/3181).\
  \ Impacted on-chain verifiers have already been disabled via the estop mechanism outlined\
  \ in the [Verifier Management Design](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/blob/release-2.0/contracts/version-management-design.md#base-verifier-implementations).\
  \ \n\n## Mitigation\nWe recommend all impacted users upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nRust\
  \ applications using the risc0-zkvm crate at versions 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2 should upgrade\
  \ to version 2.1.0.\n\nSmart contract applications using the official [RISC Zero Verifier\
  \ Router](https://dev.risczero.com/api/blockchain-integration/contracts/verifier#verifier-router)\
  \ do not need to take any action: zkVM version 2.1 is active on all official routers, and\
  \ version 2.0 has been disabled.\n\nSmart contract applications not using the verifier router\
  \ should update their contracts to send verification calls to the 2.1 version of the verifier."
