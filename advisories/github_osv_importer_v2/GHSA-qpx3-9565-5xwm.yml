summary: |
  KubeEdge CloudCore Router memory exhaustion vulnerability
  ### Impact
  The CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service.
  Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` as below.
  ```
  modules:
    ...
    router:
      enable: true
  ```

  ### Patches
  This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

  ### Workarounds
  Disable the router module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.
