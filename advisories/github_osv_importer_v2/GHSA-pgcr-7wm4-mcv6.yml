summary: "Sensitive Data Exposure in pem\nVersions of `pem` before 1.13.2 expose sensitive data\
  \ when the `readPkcs12` is used. \n\nThe `readPkcs12` function reads the certificate and key\
  \ data from a pkcs12 file using the encryption password. As part of this process it creates\
  \ a globally readable file with a filename of 20 random 0-f characters in the temporary directory\
  \ containing the password which is then read by OpenSSL. The file containing the password\
  \ is never cleaned up after it is used giving access to the pkcs12 password to any other users\
  \ with access to read files from the system.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version\
  \ 1.13.2 or later."
