aliases:
  - CVE-2025-2885
summary: |
  tough root metadata version is not checked for sequential versioning
  ## Summary

  When updating the root role, a TUF client must establish a trusted line of continuity to the latest set of keys. While sequentially downloading new versions of the root metadata file, tough will not check that the root object version it received was the next sequential version from the previously trusted root metadata.

  ## Impact

  The tough client will trust an outdated or rotated root role in the event that an actor with control of the storage medium of a trusted TUF repository inappropriately replaced the contents of one of the root metadata files with an adequately signed previous version. As a result, tough could trust content associated with a previous root role.

  Impacted versions: < v0.20.0

  ## Patches

  A fix for this issue is available in tough version 0.20.0 and later. Customers are advised to upgrade to version 0.20.0 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.

  ## Workarounds

  There is no recommended work around. Customers are advised to upgrade to version 0.20.0 or the latest version.
