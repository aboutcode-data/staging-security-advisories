summary: |
  Sentry vulnerable to leaking superuser cleartext password in logs
  ### Impact
  When authenticating as a superuser to a self-hosted Sentry instance with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the _event_: `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser.

  ### Patches
  - Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later.
  - Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. This vulnerability is not applicable to SaaS.

  ### Workarounds
  Users can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or higher. For details on configuring self-hosted Sentry's logging level see our documentation at: https://develop.sentry.dev/config/#logging
