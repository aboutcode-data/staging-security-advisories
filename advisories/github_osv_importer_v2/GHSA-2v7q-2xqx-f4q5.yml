  - CVE-2016-10553
summary: |
  Potential SQL Injection in sequelize
  Affected versions of `sequelize` are vulnerable to SQL Injection when user input is passed into `findOne` or into a statement such as `where: "user input"`.



  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 3.0.0 or later.

  Version 3.0.0 will introduce a number of breaking changes.
  Thankfully, the project authors have provided a 2.x -> 3.x [upgrade guide](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/wiki/Upgrade-from-2.0-to-3.0) to ease this transition.

  If upgrading is not an option, it is also possible to mitigate this by ensuring that all uses of `where: "input"` and `findOne("input")` are properly sanitized, such as by the use of a wrapper function.
