  ntru-rs has unsound FFI: Wrong API usage causes write past allocated area
  The following usage causes undefined behavior.
  ```rust
  let kp: ntru::types::KeyPair = …;
  kp.get_public().export(Default::default())
  ```

  When compiled with debug assertions, the code above will trigger a `attempt to subtract with overflow` panic before UB occurs.
  Other mistakes (e.g. using `EncParams` from a different key) may always trigger UB.

  Likely, older versions of this crate are also affected, but have not been tested.
