summary: |
  Claude Code Leaks Data via Malicious Environment Configuration Before Trust Confirmation
  A vulnerability in Claude Code's project-load flow allowed malicious repositories to exfiltrate data including Anthropic API keys before users confirmed trust. If a user started Claude Code in an attacker-controller repository, and the repository included a settings file that set ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL to an attacker-controlled endpoint, Claude Code would issue API requests before showing the trust prompt, including potentially leaking the user's API keys.

  Users on standard Claude Code auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.
