  atty potential unaligned read
  On windows, `atty` dereferences a potentially unaligned pointer.

  In practice however, the pointer won't be unaligned unless a custom global allocator is used.

  In particular, the `System` allocator on windows uses `HeapAlloc`, which guarantees a large enough alignment.

  # atty is Unmaintained

  A Pull Request with a fix has been provided over a year ago but the maintainer seems to be unreachable.

  Last release of `atty` was almost 3 years ago.
