summary: |
  Field-level access-control bypass for multiselect field
  #### Impact

  `@keystone-6/core@2.2.0 || 2.3.0` users who are using the `multiselect` field, and provided field-level access control - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used.

  List-level access control is **NOT** affected.

  Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are **NOT** affected.

  Example, **you are vulnerable if** you are using field-level access control on a `multiselect` like the following:
  ```ts
  const yourList = list({
    access: {
      // this is list-level access control, this is NOT impacted
    },
    fields: {
      yourFieldName: multiselect({
        // this is field-level access control, for multiselect fields
        //   this is vulnerable
        access: {
          create: ({ session }) => session?.data.isAdmin,
          update: ({ session }) => session?.data.isAdmin,
        },
        options: [
          { value: 'apples', label: 'Apples' },
          { value: 'oranges', label: 'Oranges' },
        ],
        // ...
      }),
      // ...
    },
    // ...
  });
  ```

  #### Mitigation
  Please upgrade to `@keystone-6/core >= 2.3.1`, where this vulnerability has been closed.

  #### Workarounds
  If for some reason you cannot upgrade your dependencies, you should stop using the `multiselect` field.
