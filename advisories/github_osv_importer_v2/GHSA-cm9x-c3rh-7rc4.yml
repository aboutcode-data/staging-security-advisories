  - CVE-2022-4318
summary: "CRI-O vulnerable to /etc/passwd tampering resulting in Privilege Escalation\n### Impact\n\
  It is possible to craft an environment variable with newlines to add entries to a container's\
  \ /etc/passwd. It is possible to circumvent admission validation of username/UID by adding\
  \ such an entry.\n\nNote: because the pod author is in control of the container's /etc/passwd,\
  \ this is not considered a new risk factor. However, this advisory is being opened for transparency\
  \ and as a way of tracking fixes.\n\n### Patches\n1.26.0 will have the fix. More patches will\
  \ be posted as they're available.\n\n### Workarounds\nAdditional security controls like SELinux\
  \ should prevent any damage a container is able to do with root on the host. Using SELinux\
  \ is recommended because this class of attack is already possible by manually editing the\
  \ container's /etc/passwd \n\n### References"
