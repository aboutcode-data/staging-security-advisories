summary: "AWS CDK RestApi not generating authorizationScope correctly in resultant CFN template\n\
  ### Summary\nThe AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source framework for defining\
  \ cloud infrastructure using code. Customers use it to create their own applications which\
  \ are converted to AWS CloudFormation templates during deployment to a customer’s AWS account.\
  \ CDK contains pre-built components called \"constructs\" that are higher-level abstractions\
  \ providing defaults and best practices. This approach enables developers to use familiar\
  \ programming languages to define complex cloud infrastructure more efficiently than writing\
  \ raw CloudFormation templates. \n\nWe identified an issue in AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)\
  \ which, under certain conditions, can result in granting authenticated Amazon Cognito users\
  \ broader than intended access. Specifically, if a CDK application uses the \"RestApi\" construct\
  \ with \"CognitoUserPoolAuthorizer\" as the authorizer and uses authorization scopes to limit\
  \ access. This issue does not affect the availability of the specific API resources. \n\n\
  ### Impact\nAuthenticated Cognito users may gain unintended access to protected API resources\
  \ or methods, leading to potential data disclosure, and modification issues. \n\nImpacted\
  \ versions: >=2.142.0;<=2.148.0\n\n### Patches\nThe patch is included in CDK version >=2.148.1.\n\
  \n### Recommended Actions\n* Upgrade your AWS CDK version to 2.148.1 or newer and re-deploy\
  \ your application(s) to address this issue.\n* If you are using older CDK versions before\
  \ 2.142.0, you are not affected by this issue, however it is recommended to upgrade to the\
  \ latest version to receive the latest features and fixes.\n* Confirm whether your application(s)\
  \ is affected by searching for \"CognitoUserPoolsAuthorizer\" in your CDK application. If\
  \ it is referenced inside the \"RestApi\" construct, and the \"RestApi\" resource or method\
  \ utilize authorization scopes to limit access, and you deployed your applications using the\
  \ impacted versions of CDK, your application is affected.\n\n\n\n### References\n* AWS CDK\
