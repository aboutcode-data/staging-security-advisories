  Remote code injection in Log4j
  ### Impact
  Logging untrusted or user controlled data with a vulnerable version of Log4J may result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) against your application. This includes untrusted data included in logged errors such as exception traces, authentication failures, and other unexpected vectors of user controlled input.

  More Details:
  https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q

  ### Patches
  Version 1.11.1 of the Splunk Logging for Java library.

  There is also a backport to version 1.6.2 released as a patch: 1.6.2-0-0.

  ### Workarounds
  If upgrading is not possible, then ensure the -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property is set on both client- and server-side components.
