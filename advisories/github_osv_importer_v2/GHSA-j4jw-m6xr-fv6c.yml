  - CVE-2025-22130
summary: |
  Soft Serve vulnerable to path traversal attacks
  ### Impact

  Path traversal attack gives access to existing non-admin users to access and take over other user's repositories. A malicious user then can modify, delete, and arbitrarily repositories as if they were an admin user without explicitly giving them permissions.

  ### Patches

  This is patched in [v0.8.2](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.8.2)

  ### Workarounds

  Single user set-ups are not affected. This only affects multi-user Soft Serve set-ups that enable repository creation for users. Otherwise, upgrading is necessary to circumvent the attack.
