summary: "Apache Pulsar: Improper Authorization For Namespace and Topic Management Endpoints\n\
  This vulnerability allows authenticated users with produce or consume permissions to perform\
  \ unauthorized operations on partitioned topics, such as unloading topics and triggering compaction.\
  \ These management operations should be restricted to users with the tenant admin role or\
  \ superuser role. An authenticated user with produce permission can create subscriptions and\
  \ update subscription properties on partitioned topics, even though this should be limited\
  \ to users with consume permissions. This impact analysis assumes that Pulsar has been configured\
  \ with the default authorization provider. For custom authorization providers, the impact\
  \ could be slightly different. Additionally, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user\
  \ to read, create, modify, and delete namespace properties in any namespace in any tenant.\
  \ In Pulsar, namespace properties are reserved for user provided metadata about the namespace.\n\
  \nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.7.1 to 2.10.6, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.4, from\
  \ 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.3, and from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1. \n\n3.0 Apache Pulsar users\
  \ should upgrade to at least 3.0.4.\n3.1 and 3.2 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at\
  \ least 3.2.2.\n\nUsers operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the\
  \ aforementioned patched versions or newer versions."
