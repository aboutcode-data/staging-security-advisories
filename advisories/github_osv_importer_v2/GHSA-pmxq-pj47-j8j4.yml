  - CVE-2023-41329
summary: |
  Domain restrictions bypass via DNS Rebinding in WireMock and WireMock Studio webhooks, proxy and recorder modes
  ### Impact

  The proxy mode of WireMock, can be protected by the network restrictions configuration, as documented in [Preventing proxying to and recording from specific target addresses](https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses). These restrictions can be configured using the domain names, and in such a case the configuration is vulnerable to the DNS rebinding attacks. A similar patch was applied in WireMock 3.0.0-beta-15 for the WireMock Webhook Extensions.

  The root cause of the attack is a defect in the logic which allows for a race condition triggered by a DNS server whose address expires in between the initial validation and the outbound network request that might go to a domain that was supposed to be prohibited. Control over a DNS service is required to exploit this attack, so it has high execution complexity and limited impact.

  ### Affected versions

  - WireMock 3,x until 3.0.3 (security patch), on default settings in environments with access to the network
  - WireMock 2.x until 2.35.1 (security patch), on default settings in environments with access to the network
  - Python WireMock until 2.6.1
  - WireMock Studio - all versions, this proprietary product was discontinued in 2022


  ### Patches

  - WireMock 3.0.3 + the 3.0.3-1 Docker image
  - WireMock 2.35.1 + the 2.35.1-1 Docker image - backport to WireMock 2.x
  - Python WireMock 2.6.1

  ### Workarounds

  For WireMock:

  - Option 1: Configure WireMock to use IP addresses instead of the domain names in the outbound URLs subject to DNS rebinding
  - Option 2: Use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations

  For WireMock Studio: N/A. Switch to another distribution, there will be no fix provided. The vendor of former WireMock Studio recommends migration to [WireMock Cloud](https://www.wiremock.io/product)
