  SafeURL-Python's hostname blocklist does not block FQDNs
  ### Description
  If a hostname was blacklisted, it was possible to bypass the blacklist by requesting the FQDN of the host (e.g. adding `.` to the end).

  ### Impact
  The main purpose of this library is to block requests to internal/private IPs and these cannot be bypassed using this finding. But if a library user had specifically set certain hostnames as blocked, then an attacker would be able to circumvent that block to cause SSRFs to request those hostnames.
