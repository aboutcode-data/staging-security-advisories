summary: "Potential privilege escalation on Kubernetes >= v1.19 when the Argo Sever is run with\
  \ `--auth-mode=client`\n### Impact\n\nThis is pro-active fix. No know exploits exist. \n\n\
  Impacted:\n\n* You're running Kubernetes >= v1.19\n* You're running Argo Server\n* It is configured\
  \ to with `--auth-mode=client`\n* Is not configured with `--auth-mode=server`\n* You are not\
  \ running Argo Server in Kubernetes pod. E.g. on bare metal or other VM.\n* You're using client\
  \ key to authenticate on the server. \n* The server has more permissions that the connecting\
  \ client's account.\n\nThe client's authentication will be ignored and the server's authentication\
  \ will be used. This will result in privilege escalation to that of the the server's account.\n\
  \n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/6506\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nNone."
