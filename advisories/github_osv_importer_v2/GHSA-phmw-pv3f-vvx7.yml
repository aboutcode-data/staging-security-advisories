  Moderate severity vulnerability that affects paperclip
  Withdrawn, accidental duplicate publish.

  The thoughtbot paperclip gem before 4.2.2 for Ruby does not consider the content-type value during media-type validation, which allows remote attackers to upload HTML documents and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a spoofed value, as demonstrated by image/jpeg.
