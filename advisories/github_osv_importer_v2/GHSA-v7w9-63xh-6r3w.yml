summary: |
  LibreNMS has a Reflected XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/functions.php
  ### Summary
  A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "section" parameter of the "logs" tab of a device allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when a user accesses the page with a malicious "section" parameter, potentially compromising their session and enabling unauthorized actions. The issue arises from a lack of sanitization in the "report_this()" function.

  ### Details
  The "section" parameter of the "logs" tab is vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can inject the following XSS payload into the "section" parameter:
  ```<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<%2fscript>```

  When the page is loaded with this malicious parameter, the script executes immediately. This vulnerability occurs due to the lack of sanitization in the "report_this()" function. Other endpoints using this same function may also be vulnerable.

  The vulnerable sink is located here:
  https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/functions.php#L523
  https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/pages/device/logs.inc.php#L93

  ### PoC
  1. Inject the following payload into the "section" parameter of the "logs" tab:
  ```<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<%2fscript>```
  2. Access the page with the injected payload.
  3. Observe that the injected script executes when the page is loaded.

  Example URL: ```http://<your_url>/device/device=1/tab=logs/section=%3Cscript%3Econstructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();%3C%2fscript%3E/```

  Example Request:
  ```http
  GET /device/device=1/tab=logs/section=%3Cscript%3Econstructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();%3C%2fscript%3E/ HTTP/1.1
  Host: <your_host>
  Cookie: <your_cookie>
  ```

  ### Impact

  This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user’s session by crafting a malicious URL. The attack could lead to session hijacking, unauthorized actions, or further exploitation by injecting malicious scripts.
