  - CVE-2016-10687
summary: "windows-selenium-chromedriver downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of\
  \ `windows-selenium-chromedriver` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP\
  \ connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is\
  \ possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting\
  \ in code execution on the system running `windows-selenium-chromedriver`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
  \nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently\
  \ to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively,\
  \ the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while\
  \ connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only\
  \ people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or\
  \ those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
