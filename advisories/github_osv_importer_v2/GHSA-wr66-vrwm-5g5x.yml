  - CVE-2022-21721
summary: |
  Denial of Service Vulnerability in next.js
  ### Impact

  Vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone running a Next.js app at version >= 12.0.0, and using i18n functionality.

  - **Affected:** All of the following must be true to be affected by this CVE
    - Next.js versions above v12.0.0
    - Using next start or a custom server
    - Using the built-in i18n support
  - **Not affected:**
    - Deployments on Vercel (vercel.com) are not affected along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js.

  ### Patches

  A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. We recommend all affected users upgrade as soon as possible.

  ### Workarounds

  We recommend upgrading whether you can reproduce or not although you can ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until you upgrade.
