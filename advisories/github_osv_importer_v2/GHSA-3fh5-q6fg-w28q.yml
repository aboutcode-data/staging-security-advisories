summary: "Prototype pollution in Snowboard framework\n### Impact\n\nThe Snowboard framework\
  \ in affected versions is vulnerable to prototype pollution in the main Snowboard class as\
  \ well as its plugin loader. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/2a13faf99972e84c9661258f16c4750fa99d29a1\
  \ (for 1.2) and https://github.com/wintercms/winter/commit/bce4b59584abf961e9400af3d7a4fd7638e26c7f\
  \ (for 1.1) and is available with Winter v1.1.10 and v1.2.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you\
  \ have not yet upgraded, or are using the 1.1 branch of Winter (1.1.8 or above), you can avoid\
  \ this issue by following some common security practices for JavaScript, including implementing\
  \ a [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and auditing\
  \ your scripts.\n\nThe 1.0 branch of Winter is not affected, as it does not contain the Snowboard\
  \ framework.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this\
  \ advisory:\n\n- Email us at [hello@wintercms.com](mailto:hello@wintercms.com)"
