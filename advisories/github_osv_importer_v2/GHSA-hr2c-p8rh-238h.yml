summary: "Apache Axis Improper Input Validation vulnerability\n** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED\
  \ ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Axis allowed users with access to the\
  \ admin service to perform possible SSRF.\nThis issue affects Apache Axis through 1.3.\n\n\
  As Axis 1 has been EOL, we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache\
  \ Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06\
  \ applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release \nfixing\
  \ this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome."
