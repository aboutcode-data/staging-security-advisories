summary: "Ineffective privileges drop when requesting container network\n### Impact\n\nFix https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/pull/1523\
  \ included in Apptainer 1.2.0-rc.2 has introduced an ineffective privilege drop when requesting\
  \ container network setup, therefore subsequent functions are called with root privileges.\
  \  The attack surface is rather limited for users but an attacker could possibly craft a starter\
  \ config to delete any directory on the host filesystems.  Only affects setuid installations\
  \ of Apptainer.  \n\n### Patches\n\nThe security fix https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/pull/1578\
  \ has been included in Apptainer 1.2.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround\
  \ outside of upgrading to Apptainer 1.2.1"
