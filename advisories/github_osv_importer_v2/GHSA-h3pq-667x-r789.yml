summary: |
  Plate media plugins has a XSS in media embed element when using custom URL parsers
  ### Impact
  Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and instead consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised.

  The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected.

  Examples of vulnerable code:

  ```tsx
  const { embed } = useMediaState({
    urlParsers: [
      // Custom parser that does not use an allowlist or validate the URL protocol
      (url) => ({ url }),
    ],
  });

  return (
    <iframe
      src={embed!.url}
      // ...
    />
  );
  ```

  ```tsx
  const { url } = useMediaState();

  return (
    <iframe
      // url property used directly from useMediaState() with no sanitisation
      src={url}
      // ...
    />
  );
  ```


  ```tsx
  const { url } = element;

  return (
    <iframe
      // url property used directly from element with no sanitisation
      src={url}
      // ...
    />
  );
  ```

  ### Patches
  `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`.

  In addition, the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe, but has not been renamed. If you're using either of these properties directly, you will still need to validate the URL yourself.

  ### Workarounds
  Ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values.

  If `url` is consumed directly, validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element.
