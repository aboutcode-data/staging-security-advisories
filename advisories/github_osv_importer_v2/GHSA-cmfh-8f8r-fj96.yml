  - CVE-2017-1000163
summary: "Phoenix Arbitrary URL Redirect\nThe Phoenix team designed `Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2`\
  \ to protect against redirects allowing user input to redirect to an external URL where your\
  \ application code otherwise assumes a local path redirect. This is why the `:to` option is\
  \ used for “local” URL redirects and why you must pass the `:external` option to intentionally\
  \ allow external URLs to be redirected to. It has been disclosed that carefully crafted user\
  \ input may be treated by some browsers as an external URL. An attacker can use this vulnerability\
  \ to aid in social engineering attacks. The most common use would be to create highly believable\
  \ phishing attacks. For example, the following user input would pass local URL validation,\
  \ but be treated by Chrome and Firefox as external URLs: \n`http://localhost:4000/?redirect=/\\\
  nexample.com`\nNot all browsers are affected, but latest Chrome and Firefox will issue a get\
  \ request for `example.com` and successfully redirect externally"
