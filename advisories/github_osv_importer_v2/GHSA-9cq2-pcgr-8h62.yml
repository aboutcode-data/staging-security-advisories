summary: "Cross-site Scripting in eZFind spellcheck\nThis security advisory fixes a vulnerability\
  \ in the legacy eZ Find extension, which can be used with the LegacyBridge in eZ Platform.\
  \ It affects sites using the \"Did you mean...?\" spell check / search suggestion feature.\
  \ This feature is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) injection (reflected XSS). The\
  \ update adds the necessary escaping of injected code. If you're affected, we recommend that\
  \ you install it as soon as possible.\n \nIf you have custom search templates, please make\
  \ sure you update these as well. Ensure that \"search_extras.spellcheck_collation\" is followed\
  \ by the \"wash\" operator, like this:\n{$search_extras.spellcheck_collation|wash}\n \nTo\
  \ install, use Composer to update to one of the \"Resolving versions\" mentioned above, or\
  \ apply this patch manually:\nhttps://github.com/ezsystems/ezfind/commit/51c17ea9b1231c20db8221f34d01c649060f1e91"
