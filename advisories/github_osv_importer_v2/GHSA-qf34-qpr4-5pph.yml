summary: |
  docusaurus-plugin-content-gists vulnerability exposes GitHub Personal Access Token
  ## GitHub Personal Access Token Exposure in docusaurus-plugin-content-gists

  ### Summary

  docusaurus-plugin-content-gists versions prior to 4.0.0 are vulnerable to exposing GitHub Personal Access Tokens in production build artifacts when passed through plugin configuration options. The token, intended for build-time API access only, is inadvertently included in client-side JavaScript bundles, making it accessible to anyone who can view the website's source code.

  ### Affected Versions

  - All versions < 4.0.0

  ### Patched Versions

  - Version 4.0.0 and later

  ### Impact

  When using the affected versions with the recommended configuration pattern:

  ```javascript
  plugins: [
    [
      'docusaurus-plugin-content-gists',
      {
        personalAccessToken: process.env.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN,
      },
    ],
  ]
  ```

  The GitHub Personal Access Token is included in the webpack bundle and exposed in production builds at:
  - `/build/assets/js/main.[hash].js`

  This allows malicious actors to:
  - Extract the GitHub Personal Access Token from the website's JavaScript files
  - Use the stolen token to access the token owner's GitHub account with the granted permissions
  - Potentially access private gists, repositories, or perform other actions depending on the token's scope

  ## Mitigation steps

    1. Immediately revoke access to the GitHub PAT that was used: https://github.com/settings/tokens

  ### Migration steps

    1. Update to version 4.0.0+: `npm install docusaurus-plugin-content-gists@^4.0.0`
    3. Remove `personalAccessToken` from your plugin configuration
    4. Ensure `GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set in your build environment
