  solspace/craft-freeform Vulnerable to XSS in `PhpSpreadsheet` HTML Writer Due to Unsanitized Styling Data
  ### Summary
  _Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server._

  \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html doesn't sanitize spreadsheet styling information such as font names, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript on the page.

  ### Details

  See https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgmf-q9vr-vww6

  ### PoC
  _Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability._

  Example target script:

  ```
  <?php

  require 'vendor/autoload.php';

  $reader = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::createReader("Xlsx");
  $spreadsheet = $reader->load(__DIR__ . '/book.xlsx');

  $writer = new \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html($spreadsheet);
  print($writer->generateHTMLAll());
  ```

  Save this file in the same directory:

  [book.xlsx](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/files/15212797/book.xlsx)
