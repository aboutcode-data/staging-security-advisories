  - CVE-2025-61778
summary: "Akka.Remote TLS did not properly implement certificate-based authentication\n### Impact\n\
  \nThis is a critical network security vulnerability for Akka.Remote **users who have SSL /\
  \ TLS enabled** on their Akka.Remote connections and were expecting certificate-based authentication\
  \ to be enforced on all peers attempting to join the network.\n\nIn all versions of Akka.Remote\
  \ from v1.2.0 to v1.5.51, TLS could be enabled via our `akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp` transport\
  \ and this would correctly enforce private key validation on the server-side of inbound connections.\
  \ Akka.Remote, however, never asked the outbound-connecting client to present ITS certificate\
  \ - therefore it's possible for untrusted parties to connect to a private key'd Akka.NET cluster\
  \ and begin communicating with it **without any certificate**. \n\nThe issue here is that\
  \ for certificate-based authentication to work properly, ensuring that all members of the\
  \ Akka.Remote network are secured with the same private key, Akka.Remote needed to implement\
  \ mutual TLS. This was not the case before Akka.NET v1.5.52.\n\nIf you are running Akka.NET\
  \ inside a private network you fully control or you were never using TLS in the first place,\
  \ then this bug has no impact on you. However: if you are using TLS to secure your network\
  \ YOU MUST upgrade to Akka.NET V1.5.52 or later.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7847\
  \ - forces \"fail fast\" semantics if TLS is enabled but the private key is missing or invalid.\
  \ Previous versions would only check that once connection attempts occurred.\nhttps://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7851\
  \ - **critical fix**: enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) by default, so both parties must be keyed\
  \ using the same certificate. This fulfills the original security \n\nThese updates have been\
  \ shipped into Akka.NET v1.5.52: https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/releases/tag/1.5.52\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nIf your application isn't exposed publicly, then CVE-2025-61778 has no\
  \ practical impact on your application. That being said: upgrading to Akka.NET v1.5.52 or\
  \ later is a good idea.\n\n### References\n\nPlease view our latest network security documentation\
