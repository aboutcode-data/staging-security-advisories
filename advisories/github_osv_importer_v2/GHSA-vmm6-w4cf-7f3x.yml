aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5206
summary: |
  Authentication Bypass For Endpoints With Anonymous Access in Opencast
  ### Impact

  Using a remember-me cookie with an arbitrary username can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the remember-me cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows anonymous access.

  This way, an attacker can, for example, fake a remember-me token, assume the identity of the global system administrator and request non-public content from the search service without ever providing any proper authentication.


  ### Patches

  This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1


  ### Workarounds

  As a workaround for older, unpatched versions, disabling remember-me cookies in `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` will mitigate the problem but will obviously also disable this feature without obvious indication. To deactivate this, remove the following line from the security configuration:

  ```xml
  <sec:remember-me … />
  ```
