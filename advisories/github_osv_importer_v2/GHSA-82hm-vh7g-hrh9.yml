  Partial read is incorrect in molecule
  ### Impact

  Anyone who uses `total_size(..)` function to partial read the length of any `FixVec` will get an incorrect result, due to an incorrect implementation. This has been resolved in the 0.7.2 release.

  ### Workarounds

  If you already have the whole `FixVec` `A`, you can use `A.as_slice().len()` to get the total size of the `FixVec`.
