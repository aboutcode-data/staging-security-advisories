summary: "OctoPrint Authenticated Reverse Proxy Page Authentication Bypass\n### Impact\n\nOctoPrint\
  \ versions up until and including 1.10.3 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker to\
  \ bypass the login redirect and directly access the rendered HTML of certain frontend pages.\
  \ \n\nThe impact on data exposure is minimal because, typically, data is loaded via API requests\
  \ that correctly enforce user authentication. In the current codebase, cases where data is\
  \ directly embedded in the page content are rare. However, one notable exception is the authenticated\
  \ variant of the reverse proxy test page, which displays the IP addresses of configured reverse\
  \ proxies. \n\nThe primary risk lies in potential future modifications to the codebase that\
  \ might incorrectly rely on the vulnerable internal functions for authentication checks, leading\
  \ to security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version\
  \ 1.11.0.\n\n### Details\n\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the following\
  \ functions defined in [octoprint/server/util/init.py](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/d79a0d20f3f1c7f2edb56dedda3b70267a937e65/src/octoprint/server/util/__init__.py):\n\
  \n- `require_login`\n- `require_login_with`\n- `require_fresh_login_with`\n\nBy adding the\
  \ HTTP header `X-Preemptive-Recording: yes` to HTTP requests, these functions allow requests\
  \ to proceed without redirecting to the login screen, effectively bypassing the login mechanism\
  \ in the frontend. However, this only grants access to frontend page content, while authenticated\
  \ API endpoints still enforce proper session validation.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi"
