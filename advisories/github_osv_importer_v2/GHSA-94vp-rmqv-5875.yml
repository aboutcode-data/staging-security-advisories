aliases:
  - CVE-2020-15247
summary: |
  Twig Sandbox Escape by authenticated users with access to editing CMS templates when safemode is enabled.
  ### Impact
  An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP.

  This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP.

  ### Patches
  Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.

  ### Workarounds
  Apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/compare/106daa2930de4cebb18732732d47d4056f01dd5b...7cb148c1677373ac30ccfd3069d18098e403e1ca to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 469.
