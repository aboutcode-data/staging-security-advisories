summary: "go-git improperly verifies data integrity values for .idx and .pack files\n### Impact\
  \ \n\nA vulnerability was discovered in `go-git` whereby data integrity values for `.pack`\
  \ and `.idx` files were not properly verified. This resulted in `go-git` potentially consuming\
  \ corrupted files, which would likely result in unexpected errors such as `object not found`.\n\
  \nFor context, clients fetch [`packfiles`](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-protocol#_packfile_data)\
  \ from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their contents, so that clients\
  \ can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes (`.idx`) are [generated](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format)\
  \ locally by `go-git`, or the `git` cli, when new `.pack` files are received and processed.\
  \ The integrity checks for both files were not being verified correctly.\n\nNote that the\
  \ lack of verification of the packfile checksum has no impact on the trust relationship between\
  \ the client and server, which is enforced based on the protocol being used (e.g. TLS in the\
  \ case of `https://` or known hosts for `ssh://`). In other words, the packfile checksum verification\
  \ does not provide any security benefits when connecting to a malicious or compromised Git\
  \ server.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to `v5.16.5`, or the latest `v6` [pseudo-version](https://go.dev/ref/mod#pseudo-versions),\
  \ in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn case updating to a fixed\
  \ version of `go-git` is not possible, users can run [git fsck](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck)\
  \ from the `git` cli to check for data corruption on a given repository. \n\n### Credit\n\n\
  Thanks @N0zoM1z0 for finding and reporting this issue privately to the `go-git` project."
