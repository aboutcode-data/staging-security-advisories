aliases:
  - CVE-2025-30162
summary: |
  Cilium East-west traffic not subject to egress policy enforcement for requests via Gateway API load balancers
  ### Impact

  For Cilium users who:
  - Use Gateway API for Ingress for some services **AND**
  - Use [LB-IPAM](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/lb-ipam/) or BGP for LB Service implementation **AND**
  - Use network policies to block egress traffic from workloads in a namespace to workloads in other namespaces

  Egress traffic from workloads covered by such network policies to LoadBalancers configured by `Gateway` resources will incorrectly be allowed.

  LoadBalancer resources not deployed via a Gateway API configuration are not affected by this issue.

  ### Patches

  This issue was fixed by https://github.com/cilium/proxy/pull/1172.

  This issue affects:

  - Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.14 inclusive
  - Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive
  - Cilium v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive

  This issue is fixed in:

  - Cilium v1.15.15
  - Cilium v1.16.8
  - Cilium v1.17.2

  ### Workarounds

  A Clusterwide Cilium Network Policy can be used to work around this issue for users who are unable to upgrade. An outline of such a policy is provided below:

  ```
  apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
  kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: "workaround"
  spec:
    endpointSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - key: reserved:ingress
        operator: Exists
    ingress:
    - fromEntities:
      - world
  ```

  - The policy opens up connectivity from all locations outside the cluster into the Cilium Ingress Gateway.
  - The policy establishes a default deny for all other traffic towards the Cilium Ingress Gateway, including all in-cluster sources.
  - It is possible to tailor the policy to more narrowly allow inbound traffic while creating a default deny posture for traffic between namespaces. Users should edit the policy to bring it in line with the security requirements particular to their environments.

  ### Acknowledgements

  The Cilium community has worked together with members of the Isovalent team to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @jrajahalme for the fix.
