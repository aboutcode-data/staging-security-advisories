summary: "Magento LTS vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in admin system configs\n\
  ### Impact\n\nThis XSS vulnerability is about the system configs\n* design/header/welcome\n\
  * design/header/logo_src\n* design/header/logo_src_small\n* design/header/logo_alt\n\nThey\
  \ are intended to enable admins to set a text in the two cases, and to define an image url\
  \ for the other two cases.\nBut because of previously missing escaping allowed to input arbitrary\
  \ html and as a consequence also arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nWhile this is in most usage scenarios\
  \ not a relevant issue, some people work with more restrictive roles in the backend. Here\
  \ the ability to inject JavaScript with these settings would be an unintended and unwanted\
  \ privilege.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade\
  \ to?_  \n\nThe problem is patched with Version 20.10.1 or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is\
  \ there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_  \n\nPossible\
  \ mitigations are\n* Restricting access to the System Configs \n* checking templates where\
  \ these settings are used to apply proper html filtering\n\n### For Users relying on this\
  \ possibility\n\nSome Users might actually rely on the ability to use html there.\nYou can\
  \ restore the previous behavior by making use of the new introduced `->getUnescapedValue()`\
  \ method on this escaped elements. Developers should have a look at the newly introduced `Mage_Core_Model_Security_HtmlEscapedString`\n\
  \n### Credit\n\nCredit goes to  Aakash Adhikari @justlife4x4 for finding this issue"
