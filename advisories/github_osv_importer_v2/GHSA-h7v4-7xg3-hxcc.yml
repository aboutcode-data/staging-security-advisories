  - CVE-2021-39147
summary: |
  XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary Code Execution attack
  ### Impact
  The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.

  ### Patches
  XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.

  ### Workarounds
  See [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.

  ### References
  See full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39147](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39147.html).

  ### Credits
  wh1t3p1g from TSRC (Tencent Security Response Center) found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.
