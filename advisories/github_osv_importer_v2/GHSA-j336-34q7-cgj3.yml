summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in healthcenter\nAffected versions of `healthcenter`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\

  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `healthcenter`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis package has been deprecated, and\
  \ moved to a new package on npm: [`appmetrics`](https://npmjs.com/package/appmetrics).\n\n\
  In order to mitigate this vulnerability, please install the `appmetrics` package in place\
  \ of `healthcenter` via the following commands:\n```\nnpm uninstall healthcenter -s\nnpm install\
  \ appmetrics -s\n```"
