  - CVE-2016-10673
summary: "ipip-coffee downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `ipip-coffee` insecurely\
  \ download resources over HTTP. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network\
  \ position, they can modify or read such resources at will. This could impact the integrity\
  \ and availability of the data being used to make geolocation decisions by an application.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best\
  \ mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available.\
  \ \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package\
  \ is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private\
  \ network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised\
  \ your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors\
  \ or Rogue ISP Employees."
