summary: "Babylon Nil BlockHash in BLS vote extensions triggers panics in consensus handlers\n\
  ### Summary\n\nA vulnerability exists in Babylon’s BLS vote extension processing where a malicious\
  \ active validator can submit a VoteExtension with the `block_hash` field omitted from the\
  \ protobuf serialization. Because protobuf fields are optional, unmarshalling succeeds but\
  \ leaves `BlockHash` as nil. Babylon then dereferences this nil pointer in consensus-critical\
  \ code paths (notably `VerifyVoteExtension`, and also proposal-time vote verification), causing\
  \ a runtime panic.\n\n### Impact\n\nIntermittent validator crashes at epoch boundaries, which\
  \ would slow down the creation of the epoch boundary block.\n\n### Finder \n\nVulnerability\
  \ discovered by:\n\n- @GrumpyLaurie55348"
