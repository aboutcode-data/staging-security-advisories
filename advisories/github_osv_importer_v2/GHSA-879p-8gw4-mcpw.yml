  fgr Vulnerable to Insecure Default Variable Initialization
  ### Impact
  Any users whom would not desire a traceback to be included in their logs whenever an error is raised in their code will be affected.

  If users have inadvertently created a scenario in their code that could cause a traceback to include sensitive information _and_ a malicious entity gained access to their log stream, this could create an issue.

  ### Patches
  None yet... users will need to upgrade to `0.4.*`

  ### Workarounds
  No particularly reasonable ones at present.
