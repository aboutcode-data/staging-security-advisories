summary: |
  ibexa/admin-ui has an XSS vulnerability in Cancel/Reschedule future publication modal
  ### Impact
  This security advisory resolves an XSS vulnerability in image asset names, content language names and future publishing in the back office of the DXP. Back office access and varying levels of editing and management permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability. This typically means Editor or Administrator role, or similar. Injected XSS is persistent and may in some cases be reflected in the front office, possibly affecting end users. The fixes ensure XSS is escaped, and any existing injected XSS is rendered harmless.

  ### Patches
  See "Patched versions".

  ### Workarounds
  None.
