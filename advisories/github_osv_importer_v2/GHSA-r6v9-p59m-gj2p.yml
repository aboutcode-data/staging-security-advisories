summary: |
  Indy's NODE_UPGRADE transaction vulnerable to remote code execution
  ### Impact

  The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node `<=1.12.4` allows an improperly authenticated attacker to remotely execute code on nodes within the network.

  Network operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest Indy-Node release `>=1.12.5` as soon as possible.

  ### Patches

  The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node `>=1.12.5` has been updated to properly authenticate `pool-upgrade` transactions before any processing is performed by the request handler.  The transactions are further sanitized to prevent remote code execution.

  ### Mitigations

  Network operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest Indy-Node release `>=1.12.5` as soon as possible.
