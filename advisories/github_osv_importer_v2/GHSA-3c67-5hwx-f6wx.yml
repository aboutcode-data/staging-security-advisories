aliases:
  - CVE-2024-47084
summary: |
  Gradios's CORS origin validation is not performed when the request has a cookie
  ### Impact
  **What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**

  This vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation**, where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker’s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication.

  ### Patches
  Yes, please upgrade to `gradio>=4.44` to address this issue.

  ### Workarounds
  **Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**

  As a workaround, users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically, they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.
