  - CVE-2016-10643
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in jstestdriver\nAffected versions of `jstestdriver`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `jstestdriver`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this\
  \ vulnerability, and the package has not seen an update since 2011.\n\nThe best mitigation\
  \ is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively,\
  \ the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while\
  \ connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only\
  \ people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or\
  \ those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
