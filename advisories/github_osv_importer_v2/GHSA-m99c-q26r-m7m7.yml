summary: "Evmos vulnerable to unauthorized account creation with vesting module\n### Impact\n\
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nUsing the vesting module, a malicious\
  \ attacker can create a new vesting account at a given\naddress, before a contract is created\
  \ on that address.\n\nAddresses of smart contracts deployed to the EVM are deterministic.\
  \ Therefore, it would be possible for an attacker to front-run a contract creation and create\
  \ a vesting account at that address. \nWhen an address has been initialized without any contract\
  \ code deployed to it, it will not be possible to upload any afterwards. In the described\
  \ attack, this would mean that a malicious actor could prevent smart contracts from being\
  \ deployed correctly.\n\nIn order to remediate this, an alternative user flow is being implemented\
  \ for the vesting module:\n- only the account receiving the vesting funds will be able to\
  \ create such an account by calling the `CreateClawbackVestingAccount` method and defining\
  \ a funder address\n- vesting and lockup periods can then be created by that funder address\
  \ using `FundClawbackAccount`\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions\
  \ should users upgrade to?_\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate\
  \ the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can\
  \ visit to find out more?_"
