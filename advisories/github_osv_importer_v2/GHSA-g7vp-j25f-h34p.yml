aliases:
  - CVE-2023-43637
summary: |
  EVE Has Partially Predetermined Vault Key
  ### Impact

  The deriveVaultKey function calls retrieveCloudKey which always returns "foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo". When merged with the randomly generated 32-byte key using mergeKeys (16 bytes from each), the last 16 bytes are always "arfoobarfoobarfo". This enables an attacker with physical access to the EVE-OS device to attempt to brute force the remaining 128 bits of key.

  ### Patches

  Fixed in 7.10 and  8.12.1-lts

  ### Workarounds

  None
