  - CVE-2022-29188
summary: "Smokescreen SSRF via deny list bypass (square brackets)\n### Impact\nThe primary use\
  \ case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external\
  \ attackers leverage the behavior of applications to connect to or scan internal infrastructure.\n\
  \nSmokescreen also offers an option to deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by\
  \ way of a deny list. There was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the\
  \ deny list feature by surrounding the hostname with square brackets (e.g. `[example.com]`).\
  \ \n\n### Recommendation\nUpgrade Smokescreen to version 0.0.4 or later.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\
  Thanks to [Axel Chong](https://github.com/haxatron) for reporting the issue.\n\n### For more\
  \ information\nEmail us at security@stripe.com"
