summary: |
  Denial of Service in hapi
  Versions of `hapi` prior to 11.1.3 are affected by a denial of service vulnerability.

  The vulnerability is triggered when certain input is passed into the If-Modified-Since or Last-Modified headers.

  This causes an 'illegal access' exception to be raised, and instead of sending a HTTP 500 error back to the sender, hapi will continue to hold the socket open until timed out (default node timeout is 2 minutes).





  ## Recommendation

  Update to v11.1.3 or later
