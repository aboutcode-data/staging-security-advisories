  - CVE-2022-41884
summary: |
  Seg fault in `ndarray_tensor_bridge` due to zero and large inputs
  ### Impact
  If a numpy array is created with a shape such that one element is zero and the others sum to a large number, an error will be raised. E.g. the following raises an error:
  ```python
  np.ones((0, 2**31, 2**31))
  ```
  An example of a proof of concept:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import tensorflow as tf

  input_val = tf.constant([1])
  shape_val = np.array([i for i in range(21)])

  tf.broadcast_to(input=input_val,shape=shape_val)
  ```
  The return value of `PyArray_SimpleNewFromData`, which returns null on such shapes, is not checked.

  ### Patches
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [2b56169c16e375c521a3bc8ea658811cc0793784](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2b56169c16e375c521a3bc8ea658811cc0793784).

  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
