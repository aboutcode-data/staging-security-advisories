summary: |
  Karmada PULL Mode Cluster Privilege Escalation
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  The [PULL](https://karmada.io/docs/next/userguide/clustermanager/cluster-registration#pull-mode) mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters.


  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  Restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to [Karmada Component Permissions Docs](https://karmada.io/docs/administrator/security/component-permission).
