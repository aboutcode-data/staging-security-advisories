summary: |
  EVE: SSH as Root Unlockable Without Triggering Measured Boot
  ### Impact

  On boot, the Pillar container checks for /config/authorized_keys. If present with a valid public key, it enables SSH on port 22 with root login. The /config partition is not protected by measured boot, is mutable and unencrypted.

  This enables an attacker with physical access to the device to take out the disk, modify the /config partition using a separate server, then insert it, without the inserted key being flagged as an integrity voilation my measured boot and remote attestation.

  ### Patches

  Patched in 9.4.3-lts

  ### Workarounds

  None (apart from preventing physical access to the device)
