  - CVE-2022-29172
summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting in Auth0 Lock
  ### Overview

  In versions before and including `11.32.2`, when the “additional signup fields” feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property).

  Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template.

  ### Am I affected?
  You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the “additional signup fields” feature in your application.

  ### How to fix that?
  Upgrade to version `11.33.0`.

  ### Will this update impact my users?
  Additional signup fields that have been added to the signup tab on Lock will have HTML tags stripped from user input from version `11.33.0` onwards. The user will not receive any validation warning or feedback, but backend data will no longer include HTML.
