  - CVE-2022-39272
summary: |
  Improper use of metav1.Duration allows for Denial of Service
  Flux controllers within the affected versions range are vulnerable to a denial of service attack. Users that have permissions to change Flux’s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed.

  The issue has two root causes: a) the Kubernetes type `metav1.Duration` not being fully compatible with the Go type `time.Duration` as explained on [upstream report](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131); b) lack of validation within Flux to restrict allowed values.

  ### Workarounds

  Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended mitigation.

  ### Credits

  This issue was reported by Alexander Block (@codablock) through the Flux security mailing list (as [recommended](https://fluxcd.io/security/#report-a-vulnerability)).
