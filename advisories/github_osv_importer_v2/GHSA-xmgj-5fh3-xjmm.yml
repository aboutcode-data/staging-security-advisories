  - CVE-2021-43840
summary: "Path traversal when MessageBus::Diagnostics is enabled\n### Impact\n\nUsers who deployed\
  \ message bus with diagnostics features enabled (default off) were vulnerable to a path traversal\
  \ bug, which could lead to disclosure of secret information on a machine if an unintended\
  \ user were to gain access to the diagnostic route. The impact is also greater if there is\
  \ no proxy for your web application as the number of steps up the directories is not bounded.\
  \ For deployments which uses a proxy, the impact varies. For example, If a request goes through\
  \ a proxy like Nginx with `merge_slashes` enabled, the number of steps up the directories\
  \ that can be read is limited to 3 levels. \n\n### Patches\n\nPatched in 3.3.7.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nDisable MessageBus::Diagnostics in production like environments."
