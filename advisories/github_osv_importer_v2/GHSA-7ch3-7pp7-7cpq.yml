  - CVE-2023-40570
summary: |
  Datasette 1.0 alpha series leaks names of databases and tables to unauthenticated users
  ### Impact

  This bug affects Datasette instances running a Datasette 1.0 alpha - 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 or 1.0a3 - in an online accessible location but with authentication enabled using a plugin such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords).

  The `/-/api` API explorer endpoint could reveal the names of both databases and tables - but not their contents - to an unauthenticated user.

  ### Patches

  Datasette 1.0a4 has a fix for this issue.

  ### Workarounds

  To work around this issue, block all traffic to the `/-/api` endpoint. This can be done with a proxy such as Apache or NGINX, or by installing the [datasette-block](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-block) plugin and adding the following configuration to your `metadata.json` or `metadata.yml` file:

  ```json
  {
      "plugins": {
          "datasette-block": {
              "prefixes": ["/-/api"]
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  This will block access to the API explorer but will still allow access to the Datasette read or write JSON APIs, as those use different URL patterns within the Datasette `/database` hierarchy.
