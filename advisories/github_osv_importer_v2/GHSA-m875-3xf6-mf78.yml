  - CVE-2023-28846
summary: "unpoly-rails Denial of Service vulnerability\nThere is a possible Denial of Service\
  \ (DoS) vulnerability in the unpoly-rails gem that implements the [Unpoly server protocol](https://unpoly.com/up.protocol)\
  \ for Rails applications.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis issues affects Rails applications that operate\
  \ as an upstream of a load balancer's that uses [passive health checks](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-health-check/#passive-health-checks).\n\
  \nThe [unpoly-rails](https://github.com/unpoly/unpoly-rails/) gem echoes the request URL as\
  \ an `X-Up-Location` response header. By making a request with exceedingly long URLs (paths\
  \ or query string), an attacker can cause unpoly-rails to write a exceedingly large response\
  \ header.\n\nIf the response header is too large to be parsed by a load balancer downstream\
  \ of the Rails application, it may cause the load balancer to remove the upstream from a load\
  \ balancing group. This causes that application instance to become unavailable until a configured\
  \ timeout is reached or until an active healthcheck succeeds.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fixed\
  \ release 2.7.2.2+ is available via RubyGems and GitHub.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot\
  \ upgrade to a fixed release, several workarounds are available:\n\n- Configure your load\
  \ balancer to use active health checks, e.g. by periodically requesting a route with a known\
  \ response that indicates healthiness.\n- Configure your load balancer so the [maximum size\
  \ of response headers](https://makandracards.com/operations/537537-nginx-proxy-buffer-tuning)\
  \ is at least twice the [maximum size of a URL](https://tryhexadecimal.com/guides/http/414-request-uri-too-long).\n\
  - Instead of changing your server configuration you may also configure your Rails application\
  \ to delete redundant `X-Up-Location` headers set by unpoly-rails:\n  \n  ```ruby\n  class\
  \ ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n  \n    after_action :remove_redundant_up_location_header\n\
  \    \n    private\n    \n    def remove_redundant_up_location_header\n      if request.original_url\
  \ == response.headers['X-Up-Location']\n        response.headers.delete('X-Up-Location')\n\
  \      end\n    end\n  \n  end\n  ```"
