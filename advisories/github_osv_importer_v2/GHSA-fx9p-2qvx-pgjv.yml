aliases:
  - CVE-2019-10335
summary: |
  Jenkins ElectricFlow Plugin is vulnerable to stored cross site scripting vulnerability
  The plugin adds metadata displayed on build pages during its operations.

  Any user content was not escaped, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability allowing users with Job/Configure permission, or attackers controlling API responses received from ElectricFlow to render arbitrary HTML and JavaScript on Jenkins build pages.

  Build metadata is now filtered through a HTML formatter that only allows showing basic HTML, neutralizing any unsafe data. Additionally, all builds executed after the security update is applied will now properly escape content received from ElectricFlow.
