  - CVE-2020-36469
summary: |
  Data races in appendix
  The `appendix` crate implements a key-value mapping data structure called
  `Index<K, V>` that is stored on disk. The crate allows for any type to inhabit
  the generic `K` and `V` type parameters and implements Send and Sync for them
  unconditionally.

  Using a type that is not marked as `Send` or `Sync` with `Index` can allow it
  to be used across multiple threads leading to data races. Additionally using
  reference types for the keys or values will lead to the segmentation faults
  in the crate's code.
