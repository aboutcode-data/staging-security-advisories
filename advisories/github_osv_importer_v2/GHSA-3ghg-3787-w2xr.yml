summary: "Spree API has Unauthenticated IDOR - Guest Address\n### Summary\nAn Unauthenticated\
  \ Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified that allows an unauthenticated\
  \ attacker to access guest address information without supplying valid credentials or session\
  \ cookies.\n\n### Details\nDuring testing, it was observed that all guest users can make an\
  \ unauthenticated request to retrieve address data belonging to other guest users by manipulating\
  \ object identifiers. The attacker would need to know the storefront URL structure to perform\
  \ this attack (which can be learnt after creating a registered user account).\n\nAffected\
  \ Component(s)\n* Address Edit endpoint: `/addresses/{addressId}/edit`\n\nRoot Cause\n- Faulty\
  \ authorization check in CanCanCan Ability class:\n\n```diff\n- can :manage, ::Spree::Address,\
  \ user_id: user.id\n+ can :manage, ::Spree::Address, user_id: user.id if user.persisted?\n\
  ```\n\nthe `user` object in `Spree::Ability` class for guest users is a `Spree.user_class.new`\
  \ object. \n\nAddresses endpoint to access it is part of the `spree_storefront` gem. **Headless\
  \ builds using APIs are not affected,** as the Addresses endpoint there is only for registered\
  \ users, and records are scoped to the currently signed-in user.\n\n### PoC\nPreconditions\n\
  - No authentication required\n- No cookies or session tokens set\n\nTo reproduce this vulnerability\
  \ simply perform the request shown below, replacing the number with an arbitrary value. \n\
  \n**For the initial request the Guest Address id = 6 is used to obtain the information**\n\
  \n**Request**\nGET `/addresses/6/edit`\n\n<img width=\"291\" height=\"454\" alt=\"IDOR Guest\"\
  \ src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d21d01a2-8fa5-4ab1-b9e2-6ee65bd6b5a2\"\
  \ />\n\nRepeat the request and check the response, in this example using Guest Address id\
  \ = 2.\n\n**Request**\nGET `/addresses/2/edit`\n\n[<img width=\"360\" height=\"519\" alt=\"\
  IDOR Guest Address ID 2\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ce35990-3d11-4f47-9bba-266b5361313c\"\
  \ />\n](url)\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthenticated attacker can:\n\n- Enumerate and retrieve guest\
  \ address information (Addresses associated with User accounts are NOT affected)\n- Access\
  \ personally identifiable information (PII) such as:\n- Full names\n- Physical addresses\n\
  - Phone numbers (if present)\n\nThis vulnerability could lead to:\n\n- Privacy violations\n\
  - Regulatory compliance issues (e.g., GDPR)\n- Loss of user trust"
