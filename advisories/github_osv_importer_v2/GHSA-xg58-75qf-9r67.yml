summary: "Cilium's Layer 7 policy enforcement may not occur in policies with wildcarded port\
  \ ranges\n### Impact\n\nFor users with the following configuration:\n\n* An allow policy that\
  \ selects a [Layer 3 identity](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.14/security/policy/language/#layer-3-examples)\
  \ and a [port range](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#example-port-ranges)\
  \ **AND**\n* A [Layer 7 allow policy](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/language/#layer-7-examples)\
  \ that selects a specific port within the first policy's range \n\nthen Layer 7 enforcement\
  \ would not occur for the traffic selected by the Layer 7 policy.\n\nThis issue only affects\
  \ users who use Cilium's port range functionality, which was introduced in Cilium v1.16.\n\
  \nFor reference, an example of a pair of policies that would trigger this issue is:\n\n```\n\
  apiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind: CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: \"layer-3-and-4\"\
  \nspec:\n  endpointSelector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: service\n  ingress:\n    - fromCIDR:\n\
  \      - 192.168.60.0/24\n      toPorts:\n      - ports:\n        - port: \"80\"\n       \
  \   endPort: 444\n          protocol: TCP\n```\nand\n```\napiVersion: \"cilium.io/v2\"\nkind:\
  \ CiliumNetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: \"layer-4-and-7\"\nspec:\n  endpointSelector:\n\
  \    matchLabels:\n      app: service\n  ingress:\n    toPorts:\n    - ports:\n      - port:\
  \ \"80\"\n        protocol: TCP\n      rules:\n        http:\n        - method: \"GET\"\n\
  \          path: \"/public\"\n```\n\nIn the above example, requests would be permitted to\
  \ all HTTP paths on matching endpoints, rather than just `GET` requests to the `/public` path\
  \ as intended by the `layer-4-and-7` policy. In patched versions of Cilium, the `layer-4-and-7`\
  \ rule would take precedence over the `layer-3-and-4` rule.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is\
  \ patched in https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/35150.\n\nThis issue affects Cilium v1.16\
  \ between v1.16.0 and v1.16.3 inclusive.\n\nThis issue is patched in Cilium v1.16.4.\n\n###\
  \ Workarounds\n\nUsers with network policies that match the pattern described above can work\
  \ around the issue by rewriting any policies that use port ranges to individually specify\
  \ the ports permitted for traffic.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThe Cilium community has worked\
  \ together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @jrajahalme\
  \ for resolving this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments\
  \ about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\
  \nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you\
  \ to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io).\
  \ This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated\
  \ as top priority."
