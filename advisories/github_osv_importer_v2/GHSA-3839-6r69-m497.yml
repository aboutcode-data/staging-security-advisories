  Duplicate Advisory: GoUtils's randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-xg2h-wx96-xgxr. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected. The `RandomAlphaNumeric` and `CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric` functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.
