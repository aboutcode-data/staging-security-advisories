aliases:
  - CVE-2018-10189
summary: |
  Mautic Sessions could be hijacked due to tracking contacts by an auto-incremented ID
  ### Impact
  An issue was discovered in Mautic 1.x and 2.x before 2.13.0. It is possible to systematically emulate tracking cookies per contact due to tracking the contact by their auto-incremented ID. Thus, a third party can manipulate the cookie value with +1 to systematically assume being tracked as each contact in Mautic. It is then possible to retrieve information about the contact through forms that have progressive profiling enabled.

  ### Patches
  Update to 2.13.0 or later

  ### Workarounds
  None
