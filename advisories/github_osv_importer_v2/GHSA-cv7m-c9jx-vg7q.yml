summary: |
  OpenClaw has a path traversal in browser upload allows local file read
  ## Summary

  Authenticated attackers can read arbitrary files from the Gateway host by supplying absolute paths or path traversal sequences to the browser tool's `upload` action. The server passed these paths to Playwright's `setInputFiles()` APIs without restricting them to a safe root.

  Severity remains **High** due to the impact (arbitrary local file read on the Gateway host), even though exploitation requires authenticated access.

  ## Exploitability / Preconditions

  This is not a "drive-by" issue.

  An attacker must:

  - Reach the Gateway HTTP surface (or otherwise invoke the same browser control hook endpoints).
  - Present valid Gateway auth (bearer token / password), as required by the Gateway configuration.
    - In common default setups, the Gateway binds to loopback and the onboarding wizard generates a gateway token even for loopback.
  - Have the `browser` tool permitted by tool policy for the target session/context (and have browser support enabled).

  If an operator exposes the Gateway beyond loopback (LAN/tailnet/custom bind, reverse proxy, tunnels, etc.), the impact increases accordingly.

  ## Affected Packages / Versions

  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Vulnerable: `< 2026.2.14` (includes latest published `2026.2.13`)
  - Patched: `>= 2026.2.14` (planned next release)

  ## Details

  **Entry points**:

  - `POST /tools/invoke` with `{"tool":"browser","action":"upload",...}`
  - `POST /hooks/file-chooser` (browser control hook)

  When the upload paths are not validated, Playwright reads the referenced files from the local filesystem and attaches them to a page-level `<input type="file">`. Contents can then be exfiltrated by page JavaScript (e.g. via `FileReader`) or via agent/browser snapshots.

  Impact: arbitrary local file read on the Gateway host (confidentiality impact).

  ## Fix

  Upload paths are now confined to OpenClaw's temp uploads root (`DEFAULT_UPLOAD_DIR`) and traversal/escape paths are rejected.

  This fix was implemented internally; the reporter provided a clear reproduction and impact analysis.
