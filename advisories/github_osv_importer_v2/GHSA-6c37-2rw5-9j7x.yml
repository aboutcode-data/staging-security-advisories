  Malicious Package in requesst
  All versions of `requesst` typosquatted a popular package of similar name and tracked users who had installed the incorrect package. The package uploaded information to a remote server including: name of the downloaded package, name of the intended package, the Node version and whether the process was running as sudo. There is no further compromise.


  ## Recommendation

  Remove the package from your dependencies and always ensure package names are typed correctly upon installation.
