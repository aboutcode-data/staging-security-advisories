summary: "Channel creates zero value of any type\nAffected versions of this crate called `mem::zeroed()`\
  \ to create values of a user-supplied type `T`.\nThis is unsound e.g. if `T` is a reference\
  \ type (which must be non-null).\n \nThe flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::zeroed()`,\
  \ using `MaybeUninit` instead."
