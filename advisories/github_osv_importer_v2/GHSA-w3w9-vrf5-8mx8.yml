  - CVE-2022-36032
summary: "ReactPHP's HTTP server parses encoded cookie names so malicious `__Host-` and `__Secure-`\
  \ cookies can be sent\n### Impact\n\nIn ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions below v1.7.0,\
  \ when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded.\
  \ This may lead to cookies with prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with cookies\
  \ that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which\
  \ is supposed to be secure. See also CVE-2020-7070 and CVE-2020-8184 for more information.\
  \ \n\n### Patches\n\n* https://github.com/reactphp/http/commit/663c9a3b77b71463fa7fcb76a6676ffd16979dd6\
  \ - Fixed in [reactphp/http `v1.7.0`](https://github.com/reactphp/http/releases/tag/v1.7.0)\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nInfrastructure or DevOps can place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP\
  \ HTTP server to filter out any unexpected `Cookie` request headers.\n\n### References\n\n\
