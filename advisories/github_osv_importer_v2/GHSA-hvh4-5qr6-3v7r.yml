summary: "Observable Timing Discrepancy in pypqc\n### Impact\n`kyber512`, `kyber768`, and `kyber1024`\
  \ on Mac OS \\(or when compiled with clang\\) only: An attacker able to submit many decapsulation\
  \ requests against a single private key, and to gain timing information about the decapsulation,\
  \ could recover the private key. Proof-of-concept exploit exists for a local attacker.\n\n\
  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:C  \n\n### Patches\nNo patch is currently\
  \ available / pending upstream [PQClean#556](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/556).\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds have been reported. The 0.0.7 -> 0.0.7.1 upgrade, when available,\
  \ should be a drop-in replacement<!--; it has no known breaking changes-->.\n\n### References\n\
