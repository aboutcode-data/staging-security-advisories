  Regular Expression Denial of Service in underscore.string
  Versions of `underscore.string` prior to *3.3.5* are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

  The function `unescapeHTML` is vulnerable to ReDoS due to an overly-broad regex. The slowdown is approximately 2s for 50,000 characters but grows exponentially with larger inputs.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 3.3.5 or higher.
