summary: |
  XXE vulnerability in Launch import
  | Release Date | Affected Projects | Affected Versions | Access Vector| Security Risk |
  |--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
  | Monday, May 4, 2020| [service-api](https://github.com/reportportal/service-api) | Every version, starting from 3.1.0 | Remote | Medium |

  ### Impact
  Starting from version 3.1.0 we introduced a new feature of JUnit XML launch import. Unfortunately XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery.

  Report Portal versions 4.3.12+ and 5.1.1+ disables external entity resolution for theirs XML parser.

  We advise our users install the latest releases we built specifically to address this issue.
