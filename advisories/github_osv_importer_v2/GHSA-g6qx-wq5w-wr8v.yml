summary: |
  Mattermost Desktop App exposes sensitive information in its application logs
  Mattermost Desktop App versions < 6.0.0 fail to sanitize sensitive information from Mattermost logs and clear data on server deletion which allows an attacker with access to the users system to gain access to potentially sensitive information via reading the application logs.

  A fix is available for direct download via the [Mattermost Desktop](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop/releases/tag/v6.0.0) repository, but it has not been uploaded to the npm registry at time of publication.
