  - CVE-2026-24785
summary: |
  Clatter has a PSK Validity Rule Violation issue
  ### Impact

  Protocol compliance vulnerability. The library allowed post-quantum handshake patterns that violated the PSK validity rule (Noise Protocol Framework Section 9.3). This could allow PSK-derived keys to be used for encryption without proper randomization by self-chosen ephemeral randomness, weakening security guarantees and potentially allowing catastrophic key reuse.

  Affected default patterns include `noise_pqkk_psk0`, `noise_pqkn_psk0`, `noise_pqnk_psk0`, `noise_pqnn_psk0`, and some hybrid variants. Users of these patterns may have been using handshakes that do not meet the intended security properties.

  ### Patches

  The issue is fully patched and released in Clatter v2.2.0. The fixed version includes runtime checks to detect offending handshake patterns.

  ### Workarounds

  Avoid using offending `*_psk0` variants of post-quantum patterns. Review custom handshake patterns carefully.
