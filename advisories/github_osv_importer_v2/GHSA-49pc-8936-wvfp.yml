  - CVE-2026-27492
summary: |
  Lettermint Node.js SDK leaks email properties to unintended recipients when client instance is reused
  ### Impact
  Email properties (such as to, subject, html, text, and attachments) are not reset between sends when a single client instance is reused across multiple .send() calls. This can cause properties from a previous send to leak into a subsequent one, potentially delivering content or recipient addresses to unintended parties. Applications sending emails to different recipients in sequence — such as transactional flows like password resets or notifications — are affected.

  ### Patches
  Yes, the issue has been patched. Users should upgrade to v1.5.1 or later.

  ### Workarounds
  If upgrading immediately is not possible, instantiate a new client for each send:
  ```js
  const client = new Lettermint({ apiKey: process.env.LETTERMINT_API_KEY });
  await client.email.to('...').subject('...').html('...').send();
  ```

  This ensures no state is carried over between sends.
