summary: |
  Kottster app reinitialization can be re-triggered allowing command injection in development mode
  ### Impact

  **Development mode only**. Kottster contains a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability when running in development mode.

  The vulnerability combines two issues:
  1. The `initApp` action can be called repeatedly without checking if the app is already initialized, allowing attackers to create a new root admin account and obtain a JWT token
  2. The `installPackagesForDataSource` action uses unescaped command arguments, enabling command injection

  An attacker with access to a locally running development instance can chain these vulnerabilities to:
  - Reinitialize the application and receive a JWT token for a new root account
  - Use this token to authenticate
  - Execute arbitrary system commands through `installPackagesForDataSource`

  **Production deployments were never affected.**

  ### Patches

  Fixed in [v3.3.2](https://github.com/kottster/kottster/releases/tag/v3.3.2).

  Specifically, `@kottster/server` [v3.3.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kottster/server/v/3.3.2) and `@kottster/cli` [v3.3.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kottster/cli/v/3.3.2) address this vulnerability.

  We recommend developers using earlier versions of `@kottster/server` and `@kottster/cli` update all the core packages to latest release:

  ```
  npm install @kottster/common@latest @kottster/cli@latest @kottster/server@latest @kottster/react@latest
  ```

  ### Workarounds

  - Do not expose development servers to public networks or untrusted users
  - Use production mode for any deployment accessible from outside trusted environments
