  Remote Memory Exposure in mongoose
  Versions of `mongoose` before 4.3.6, 3.8.39 are vulnerable to remote memory exposure.

  Trying to save a number to a field of type Buffer on the affected mongoose versions allocates a chunk of uninitialized memory and stores it in the database.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 4.3.6, 3.8.39 or later.
