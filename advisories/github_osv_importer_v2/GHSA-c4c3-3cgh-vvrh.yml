aliases:
  - CVE-2021-21674
summary: |
  Missing permission check in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin allows viewing pending requests
  Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of pending requests.

  Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.7 requires Overall/Administer permission to view the list of pending requests.

  The previous sentence originally stated that Overall/Read permission was newly required. This statement was incorrect and has been fixed on 2021-07-05.
