  Path Traversal in serve-here.js
  Versions of `serve-here.js` prior to 1.2.0 are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to sanitize URLs, allowing attackers to access server files outside of the served folder using relative paths.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.2.0 or later.
