summary: "Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite via insufficient symlink protection due to directory\
  \ cache poisoning using symbolic links\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File\
  \ Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose\
  \ location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved\
  \ by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent\
  \ unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached\
  \ when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that\
  \ contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the\
  \ symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on\
  \ posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators,\
  \ however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.\n\nBy first creating a directory,\
  \ and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar\
  \ symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into\
  \ an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus\
  \ allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nAdditionally, a similar confusion could\
  \ arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`,\
  \ followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation\
  \ of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the\
  \ internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file\
  \ entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link,\
  \ thinking that the directory had already been created. \n\nThese issues were addressed in\
  \ releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and\
  \ did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend\
  \ you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround\
  \ is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers\
  \ may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method\
  \ which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\n\
  tar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink')\
  \ {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are\
  \ encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar\
  \ input themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways:\n\n1. All\
  \ paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `/` on Windows\
  \ systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth,\
  \ at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed\
  \ case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems,\
  \ but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the\
  \ `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path\
  \ separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a\
  \ valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared\
  \ against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\
  \nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()`\
  \ before comparing paths to one another."
