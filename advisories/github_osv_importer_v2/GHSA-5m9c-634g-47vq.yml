  - CVE-2016-10581
summary: "steroids downloads resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `steroids` insecurely\
  \ download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker\
  \ has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace\
  \ the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `steroids`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and reported in 2016, yet has not\
  \ seen a patch issued as of 03/2018. As of 08/2022, [the package is marked as deprecated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steroids)\
  \ and the GitHub repository is no longer publicly available.\n\nThe best path forward for\
  \ mitigating this issue is to attempt to use an alternative module that is actively maintained\
  \ and which provides similar functionality, such as the native PhoneGap API."
