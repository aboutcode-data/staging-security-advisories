summary: "Backend Same-Site Request Forgery in TYPO3 CMS\n> ### Meta\n> * CVSS v3.1: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C\n\
  > * CWE-352\n> * CWE-346\n\n### Problem\nIt has been discovered that backend user interface\
  \ and install tool are vulnerable to same-origin request forgery. A backend user can be tricked\
  \ into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker previously managed to upload to the\
  \ web server - scripts are then executed with the privileges of the victims' user session.\n\
  \nIn a worst case scenario new admin users can be created which can directly be used by an\
  \ attacker. The vulnerability is basically a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) triggered by\
  \ a cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus,\
  \ it’s actually a same-origin request forgery.\n\nMalicious payload such as HTML containing\
  \ JavaScript might be provided by either an authenticated backend user or by a non-authenticated\
  \ user using a 3rd party extension - e.g. file upload in a contact form with knowing the target\
  \ location.\n\nThe attacked victim requires an active and valid backend or install tool user\
  \ sessions at the time of the attack to be successful.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions\
  \ 9.5.17 or 10.4.2 that mitigates the problem described.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\
  \nThe deployment of additional mitigation techniques is suggested as described below.\n\n\
  #### Sudo Mode Extension\n\nThis TYPO3 extension intercepts modifications to security relevant\
  \ database tables, e.g. those storing user accounts or storages of the file abstraction layer.\
  \ Modifications need to confirmed by again by the acting user with providing their password\
  \ again - this technique is known as \"sudo mode\". This way unintended actions happening\
  \ in the background can be mitigated.\n\n* https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/sudo-mode\n*\
  \ https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sudo_mode\n\n#### Content Security Policy\n\n[Content\
  \ Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)\
  \ tell (modern) browsers how resources served a particular site are handled - it also it possible\
  \ to disallow script executions for specific locations. In a TYPO3 context it is suggested\
  \ to disallow direct script execution at least for locations `/fileadmin/` and `/uploads/`.\n\
  \n```\n# in fileadmin/.htaccess\n<IfModule mod_headers.c>\n\tHeader add Content-Security-Policy\
  \ \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none';\"\n</IfModule>\n```\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Matteo\
  \ Bonaker who reported this issue and to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who fixed\
  \ the issue.\n\n### References\n* https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-006"
