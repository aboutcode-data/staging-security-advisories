  - CVE-2023-25578
summary: |
  Denial of service vulnerability when parsing multipart request body
  ### Summary

  The request body parsing in `starlite` allows a potentially unauthenticated
   attacker to consume a large amount of CPU time and RAM.

  ### Details

  The multipart body parser processes an unlimited number of file parts.
  The multipart body parser processes an unlimited number of field parts.

  ### Impact

  This is a remote, potentially unauthenticated Denial of Service vulnerability.

  This vulnerability affects applications with a request handler that accepts
   a `Body(media_type=RequestEncodingType.MULTI_PART)`.

  The large amount of CPU time required for processing requests can block all
   available worker processes and significantly delay or slow down the processing
   of legitimate user requests.
  The large amount of RAM accumulated while processing requests can lead to
   Out-Of-Memory kills.
  Complete DoS is achievable by sending many concurrent multipart requests in a
   loop.
