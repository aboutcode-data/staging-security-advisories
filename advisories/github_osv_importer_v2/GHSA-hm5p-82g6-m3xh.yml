  - CVE-2026-24687
summary: "Umbraco.Forms has Path Traversal and File Enumeration Vulnerabilities in Linux/Mac\n\
  ### Impact\nIt's possible for an authenticated backoffice-user to enumerate and traverse paths/files\
  \ on the systems filesystem and read their contents, on Mac/Linux Umbraco installations using\
  \ Forms. As Umbraco Cloud runs in a Windows environment, Cloud users aren't affected. \n\n\
  ### Patches\nThis issue affects versions 16 and 17 of Umbraco Forms and is patched in 16.4.1\
  \ and 17.1.1\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, users can mitigate\
  \ this vulnerability by:\n* Configuring a WAF or reverse proxy to block requests containing\
  \ path traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`) in the `fileName` parameter of the export endpoint\n\
  * Restricting network access to the Umbraco backoffice to trusted IP ranges\n* Blocking the\
  \ `/umbraco/forms/api/v1/export` endpoint entirely if the export feature is not required\n\
  \nHowever, upgrading to the patched version is strongly recommended.\n\n### References\nCredit\
  \ to Kevin Joensen from Baldur Security for finding this vulnerability"
