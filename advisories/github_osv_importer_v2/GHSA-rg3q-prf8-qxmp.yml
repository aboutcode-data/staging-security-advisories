  - CVE-2023-30623
summary: "Arbitrary command injection in embano1/wip\n## Summary\nThe  `embano1/wip` action\
  \ uses the `github.event.pull_request.title` parameter in an insecure way. The title parameter\
  \ is used in a run statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to string\
  \ interpolation.\n\n## Details and Impact\nThis vulnerability can be triggered by any user\
  \ on GitHub. They just need to create a pull request with a commit message containing an exploit.\
  \ (Note that first-time PR requests will not be run - but the attacker can submit a valid\
  \ PR before submitting an invalid PR). The commit can be genuine, but the commit message can\
  \ be malicious. \n\nThis can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners (potentially use\
  \ it for crypto-mining, and waste your resources) and can be used to exfiltrate any secrets\
  \ that you use in the CI pipeline (including repository tokens). [Here](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/)\
  \ is a set of blog posts by Github's security team explaining this issue.\n\n## How to update\
  \ existing workflows\n\nReplace the following line in your workflow using this action with\
  \ the `v2` branch name or commit pointing to this branch:\n\n```yaml\n    uses: embano1/wip@v2\n\
  ```\n\nOr using the exact commit:\n\n```yaml\n    uses: embano1/wip@c25450f77ed02c20d00b76ee3b33ff43838739a2\
  \ # v2\n```"
