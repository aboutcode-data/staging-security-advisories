  RCE vulnerability affecting v1beta3 templates in @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend
  The templating library used by the scaffolder backend assumes that templates are trusted which is an undesired property of the scaffolder-backend. This has now been mitigated by sandboxing the template code execution.

  ### Impact
  A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template yaml definition itself and not by user input data.

  ### Patches
  This is vulnerability is patched in version `0.15.14` of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.
