  - CVE-2020-6173
summary: "Client Denial of Service on TUF\n### Impact\nAn attacker who can gain file access\
  \ to the repository and modify metadata files may cause a denial of service to clients by\
  \ creating many invalid signatures on a metadata file. Having a large number of signatures\
  \ to verify will delay the moment when the client will determine the signature is not valid.\
  \ This delay may be for at least a few minutes, but possibly could be longer especially if\
  \ multiple files are impacted.\n\nThe tuf maintainers would like to thank Erik MacLean of\
  \ Analog Devices, Inc. for reporting this issue.\n\n### Patches\nNo fix exists for this issue.\
  \ \n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are known for this issue.\n\n### References\n* [CVE-2020-6173](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6173)\n\
  * [Issue #973](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/973)"
