summary: |
  Sort order SQL injection in Administrate
  In Administrate (rubygem) before version 0.13.0, when sorting by attributes on a dashboard,
  the direction parameter was not validated before being interpolated into the SQL query.
  This could present a SQL injection if the attacker were able to modify the `direction` parameter and bypass ActiveRecord SQL protections.

  Whilst this does have a high-impact, to exploit this you need access to the Administrate dashboards, which we would expect to be behind authentication.

  This is patched in wersion 0.13.0.
