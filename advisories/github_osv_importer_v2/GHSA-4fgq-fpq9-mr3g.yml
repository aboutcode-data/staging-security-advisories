  - CVE-2025-59536
summary: "Claude Code can execute commands prior to the startup trust dialog\nDue to a bug in\
  \ the startup trust dialog implementation, Claude Code could be tricked to execute code contained\
  \ in a project before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this requires\
  \ a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code\
  \ auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are\
  \ advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/avivdon for\
  \ reporting this issue!"
