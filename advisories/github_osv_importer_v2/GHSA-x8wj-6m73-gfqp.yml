  - CVE-2020-5237
summary: |
  Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23) in chunked uploads in oneup/uploader-bundle
  ### Impact
  The vulnerability was identified in the web service for a chunked file
  upload. While the names of the POST parameters vary with the used
  frontend, their values are always used in the same way to build a path
  where the chunks are stored and assembled temporarily. By not validating
  these parameters properly, OneupUploaderBundle is susceptible to a path
  traversal vulnerability which can be exploited to upload files to
  arbitrary folders on the filesystem. The assembly process can further be
  misused with some restrictions to delete and copy files to other
  locations.

  The vulnerability can be exploited by any users that have legitimate
  access to the upload functionality and can lead to arbitrary code
  execution, denial of service and disclosure of confidential information.

  ### Patches
  Yes, see version 1.9.3 and 2.1.5.
