  Agnai File Disclosure Vulnerability: JSON via Path Traversal
  ### CWE-35: Path Traversal

  https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html

  ### CVSSv3.1 4.3 - Medium
  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

  ### Summary

  A vulnerability has been discovered in **Agnai** that permits attackers to read arbitrary JSON files at attacker-chosen locations on the server. This issue can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and exposure of confidential configuration files.
  **This only affects installations with `JSON_STORAGE` enabled which is intended to local/self-hosting only.**

  ### Details & PoC

  This is a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request:

  ```tsx
  GET /api/json/messages/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%61%70%70%2fpackage HTTP/1.1
  ```

  In this example, the attacker retrieves the `package.json` file content from the server by manipulating the file path.

  The request is processed by the `loadMessages` handler in `agnai/srv/api/json/index.ts` and a file is read and returned to the client. The read filename is constructed using string interpolation, with no guard or check for path traversal: https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai/blob/2b878b7ca66471c5dd080197ad9ca2f7f0022655/srv/api/json/index.ts#L77

  #### Constraints

  Environment constraints: JSON Storage enabled (non standard)

  ### Impact

  This vulnerability is classified as a path traversal vulnerability. Specifically, any JSON file on the server which the webserver process has read privileges for, can be disclosed to the attacker.
