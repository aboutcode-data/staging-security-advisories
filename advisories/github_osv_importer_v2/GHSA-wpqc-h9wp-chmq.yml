aliases:
  - CVE-2025-65964
summary: |
  n8n vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Git Node Custom Pre-Commit Hook
  ### Impact

  The n8n Git node allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values through the _Add Config_ operation. When an attacker-controlled workflow sets `core.hooksPath` to a directory within the cloned repository containing a Git hook such as `pre-commit`, Git executes that hook during subsequent Git operations. Because Git hooks run as local system commands, this behavior can lead to **arbitrary command execution** on the underlying n8n host.

  Successful exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow that uses the Git node.

  Affected versions: **≥ 0.123.1 and < 1.119.2**

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in **n8n version 1.119.2**.

  All users running affected versions should upgrade to **1.119.2 or later**.

  ### Workarounds

  If upgrading is not immediately possible, the following mitigations can reduce exposure:

  - Exclude the Git node ([Docs](https://n8n-docs.teamlab.info/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/#exclude-nodes)).
  - Avoid cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.
