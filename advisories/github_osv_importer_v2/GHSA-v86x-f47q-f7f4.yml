  Unauthorized File Access in atompm
  Versions of `atompm` prior to 0.8.2 are vulnerable to Unauthorized File Access. The package fails to sanitize relative paths in the URL for file downloads, allowing attackers to download arbitrary files from the system.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 0.8.2 or later.
