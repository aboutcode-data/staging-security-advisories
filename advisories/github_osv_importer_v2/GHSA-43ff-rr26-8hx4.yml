  - CVE-2025-62371
summary: |
  OpenSearch Data Prepper plugins trust all SSL certificates by default
  ### Impact

  The OpenSearch sink and source plugins in Data Prepper are configured to trust all SSL certificates by default when no certificate path was provided, making connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

  Prior to this fix, the OpenSearch sink and source plugins would automatically use a trust all SSL strategy when connecting to OpenSearch clusters if no certificate path was explicitly configured. This behavior bypassed SSL certificate validation, potentially allowing attackers to intercept and modify data in transit through man-in-the-middle attacks.

  The vulnerability affects connections to OpenSearch when the `cert` parameter is not explicitly provided.

  ### Patches

  Data Prepper 2.12.2

  ### Workarounds

  If you cannot immediately upgrade to the fixed version, you can implement the following workaround.

  #### OpenSearch sink

  Add the `cert` parameter to your OpenSearch sink configuration with the path to your cluster's CA certificate. The following example shows how to accomplish this.

  ```
  sink:
    - opensearch:
        hosts: ["https://your-opensearch-cluster:9200"]
        cert: /path/to/your/ca-certificate.pem
  ```

  #### OpenSearch source

  Add the `cert` parameter to your OpenSearch sink configuration with the path to your cluster's CA certificate. The following example shows how to accomplish this.

  ```
  sink:
    - opensearch:
        hosts: ["https://your-opensearch-cluster:9200"]
        connection:
          cert: /path/to/your/ca-certificate.pem
  ```
