summary: |
  Werkzeug safe_join() allows Windows special device names
  Werkzeug's `safe_join` function allows Windows device names as filenames if when preceded by other path segments.

  This was previously reported as https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-hgf8-39gv-g3f2, but the added filtering failed to account for the fact that `safe_join` accepts paths with multiple segments, such as `example/NUL`.

  `send_from_directory` uses `safe_join` to safely serve files at user-specified paths under a directory. If the application is running on Windows, and the requested path ends with a special device name, the file will be opened successfully, but reading will hang indefinitely.
