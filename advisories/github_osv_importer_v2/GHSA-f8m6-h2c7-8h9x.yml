summary: "Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nltk (word_tokenize, sent_tokenize)\n\
  ### Impact\nThe vulnerability is present in [`PunktSentenceTokenizer`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.punkt.html#nltk.tokenize.punkt.PunktSentenceTokenizer),\
  \ [`sent_tokenize`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize)\
  \  and [`word_tokenize`](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize).\
  \ Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to a Regular Expression\
  \ Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. \nIn short, a specifically crafted long input to any of\
  \ these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time.\
  \ The effect of this vulnerability is noticeable with the following example:\n```python\n\
  from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n\nn = 8\nfor length in [10**i for i in range(2, n)]:\n\
  \    # Prepare a malicious input\n    text = \"a\" * length\n    start_t = time.time()\n \
  \   # Call `word_tokenize` and naively measure the execution time\n    word_tokenize(text)\n\
  \    print(f\"A length of {length:<{n}} takes {time.time() - start_t:.4f}s\")\n```\nWhich\
  \ gave the following output during testing:\n```python\nA length of 100      takes 0.0060s\n\
  A length of 1000     takes 0.0060s\nA length of 10000    takes 0.6320s\nA length of 100000\
  \   takes 56.3322s\n...\n```\nI canceled the execution of the program after running it for\
  \ several hours.\n\nIf your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing\
  \ unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK\
  \ without the vulnerability, or applying the workaround described below.\n\n### Patches\n\
  The problem has been patched in NLTK 3.6.6. After the fix, running the above program gives\
  \ the following result:\n```python\nA length of 100      takes 0.0070s\nA length of 1000 \
  \    takes 0.0010s\nA length of 10000    takes 0.0060s\nA length of 100000   takes 0.0400s\n\
  A length of 1000000  takes 0.3520s\nA length of 10000000 takes 3.4641s\n```\nThis output shows\
  \ a linear relationship in execution time versus input length, which is desirable for regular\
  \ expressions.\nWe recommend updating to NLTK 3.6.6+ if possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe\
  \ execution time of the vulnerable functions is exponential to the length of a malicious input.\
  \ With other words, the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an\
  \ input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\
