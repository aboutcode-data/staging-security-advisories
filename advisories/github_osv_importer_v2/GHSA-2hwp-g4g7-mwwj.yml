  Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in jquery.terminal
  Versions of `jquery.terminal` prior to 1.21.0 are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. If the application has either of the options `anyLinks` or `invokeMethods` set to true, the application may execute arbitrary JavaScript through crafted malicious payloads due to insufficient sanitization.
