  Denial of Service in serialize-to-js
  Versions of `serialize-to-js` prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service. User input is not properly validated, allowing attackers to provide inputs that lead the execution to loop indefinitely.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 2.0.0 or later.
