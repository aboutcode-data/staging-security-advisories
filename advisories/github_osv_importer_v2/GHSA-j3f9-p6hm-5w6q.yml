aliases:
  - CVE-2025-22145
summary: |
  Carbon has an arbitrary file include via unvalidated input passed to Carbon::setLocale
  ### Impact
  Application passing unsanitized user input to `Carbon::setLocale` are at risk of arbitrary file include, if the application allows users to upload files with `.php` extension in an folder that allows `include` or `require` to read it, then they are at risk of arbitrary code ran on their servers.

  ### Patches
  - [3.8.4](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/releases/tag/3.8.4)
  - [2.72.6](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/releases/tag/2.72.6)

  ### Workarounds
  Any of the below actions can be taken to prevent the issue:
  - Validate input before calling `setLocale()`, for instance by forbidding or removing `/` and `\`
  - Call `setLocale()` only with a locale from a whitelist of supported locales
  - When uploading files, rename them so they cannot have a `.php` extension (this is recommended even if you're not affected by this issue)
  - Prefer storage system that are not local to the application (remote service, or local service ran by another user so the uploaded files actually live outside of the application basedir)
