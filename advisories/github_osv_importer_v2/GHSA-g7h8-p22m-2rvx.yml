  Prototype Pollution in flat-wrap
  All versions of `flat-wrap` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The function `unflatten` does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype, which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects.




  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
