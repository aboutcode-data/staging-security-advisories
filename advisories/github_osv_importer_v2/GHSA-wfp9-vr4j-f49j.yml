  NoSQL Injection in sequelize
  Versions of `sequelize` prior to 4.12.0 are vulnerable to NoSQL Injection. Query operators such as `$gt` are not properly sanitized and may allow an attacker to alter data queries, leading to NoSQL Injection.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 4.12.0 or later
