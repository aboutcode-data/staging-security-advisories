  - CVE-2019-10782
summary: |
  XML external entity (XXE) processing ('external-parameter-entities' feature was not fully disabled))
  Due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2019-9658](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9658), checkstyle was still vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Processing.

  ### Impact

  #### User: Build Maintainers

  This vulnerability probably doesn't impact Maven/Gradle users as, in most cases, these builds are processing files that are trusted, or pre-vetted by a pull request reviewer before being run on internal CI infrastructure.

  #### User: Static Analysis as a Service

  If you operate a site/service that parses "untrusted" Checkstyle XML configuration files, you are vulnerable to this and should patch.

  Note from the discoverer of the original CVE-2019-9658:

  > While looking at a few companies that run Checkstyle/PMD/ect... as a service I notice that it's a common pattern to run the static code analysis tool inside of a Docker container with the following flags:
  > ```
  > --net=none \
  > --privileged=false \
  > --cap-drop=ALL
  > ```
  > Running the analysis in Docker has the advantage that there should be no sensitive local file information that XXE can exfiltrate from the container. Additionally, these flags prevent vulnerabilities in static analysis tools like Checkstyle from being used to exfiltrate data via XXE or to perform SSRF.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Patched, will be released with version 8.29 at 26 Jan 2020.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  No workaround are available
