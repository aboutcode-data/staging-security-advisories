summary: "CrateDB has a Client initialized Session-Renegotiation DoS\n**Summary**  \nClient-Initiated\
  \ TLS Renegotiation Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability at Port 4200\n\n**Details**  \n\
  A high-risk vulnerability has been identified where the TLS endpoint (port 4200) permits client-initiated\
  \ renegotiation. In this scenario, an attacker can exploit this feature to repeatedly request\
  \ renegotiation of security parameters during an ongoing TLS session. This flaw could lead\
  \ to excessive consumption of CPU resources, resulting in potential server overload and service\
  \ disruption. The vulnerability was confirmed using an openssl client where the command 'R'\
  \ initiates renegotiation, followed by the server confirming with 'RENEGOTIATING'.\n\n**PoC**\
  \  \n1. Connect to the TLS server on port 4200 using an openssl client.\n2. Initiate a TLS\
  \ session.\n3. Send the renegotiation command ('R') multiple times.\n4. Observe the server\
  \ response to confirm renegotiation.\n\n**Impact**  \nThis vulnerability allows an attacker\
  \ to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated\
  \ TLS renegotiations. This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server,\
  \ posing a significant risk to operational stability and security.\n\n\nTLS 1.3 explicitly\
  \ forbids renegotiation, since it closes a window of opportunity for an attack."
