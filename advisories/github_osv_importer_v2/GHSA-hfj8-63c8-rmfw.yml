  Duplicate Advisory: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity in com.upokecenter:cbor
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-36p8-mvp6-cv38. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Inefficient algorithmic complexity in DecodeFromBytes function in com.upokecenter.cbor Java implementation of Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) versions 4.0.0 to 4.5.1 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by passing a maliciously crafted input. Depending on an application's use of this library, this may be a remote attacker.
