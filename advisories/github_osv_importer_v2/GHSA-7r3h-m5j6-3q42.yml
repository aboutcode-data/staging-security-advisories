  - CVE-2022-35954
summary: |
  @actions/core has Delimiter Injection Vulnerability in exportVariable
  ## Impact

  The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author.

  ## Patches

  Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`.

  ## Workarounds

  If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.
