summary: |
  Jupyter Server Proxy's Websocket Proxying does not require authentication
  ## Summary

  `jupyter-server-proxy` is used to expose ports local to a Jupyter server listening to web traffic to the Jupyter server's _authenticated users_ by proxying web requests and websockets. Dependent packages ([partial list](https://www.wheelodex.org/projects/jupyter-server-proxy/rdepends/)) also use `jupyter-server-proxy` to expose other popular interactive applications (such as [RStudio](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-rsession-proxy), [Linux Desktop via VNC](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy), [Code Server](https://github.com/betatim/vscode-binder), [Panel](https://github.com/holoviz/jupyter-panel-proxy), etc) along with the Jupyter server. This feature is commonly used in hosted environments (such as a JupyterHub) to expose non-Jupyter interactive frontends or APIs to the user.

  `jupyter-server-proxy` did not check user authentication appropriately when proxying websockets, allowing unauthenticated access to anyone who had network access to the Jupyter server endpoint.

  ## Impact

  This vulnerability can allow unauthenticated remote access to any websocket endpoint set up to be accessible via `jupyter-server-proxy`. In many cases (such as when exposing RStudio via [`jupyter-rsession-proxy`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-rsession-proxy) or a remote Linux Desktop / VNC via [`jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy)), this leads to **remote unauthenticated arbitrary code execution**, due to how they use websockets. The websocket endpoints exposed by `jupyter_server` itself is not affected. Projects that do not rely on websockets are also not affected.

  ## Remediation

  Upgrade `jupyter-server-proxy` to a patched version and restart any running Jupyter server.

  You may not be installing `jupyter-server-proxy` directly, but have it be pulled in as a dependency ([partial list of dependent packages](https://www.wheelodex.org/projects/jupyter-server-proxy/rdepends/)) - so you may be vulnerable even if you aren't directly depending on `jupyter-server-proxy`.

  ### For JupyterHub admins of [TLJH] installations

  <details><summary>Expand to read more</summary>

  To secure a tljh deployment's user servers, first check if `jupyter-server-proxy` is installed in the user environment with a vulnerable version. If it is, patch the vulnerability and consider terminating currently running user servers.

  [tljh]: https://tljh.jupyter.org

  #### 1. Check for vulnerability

  As an JupyterHub admin from a terminal in a started user server, you can do:

  ```bash
  sudo -E python3 -c '
  try:
      import jupyter_server_proxy
      is_vulnerable = not hasattr(jupyter_server_proxy, "__version__")
  except:
      is_vulnerable = False
  if is_vulnerable:
      print("WARNING: jupyter-server-proxy __is vulnerable__ to GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v, see https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v.")
  else:
      print("INFO: not vulnerable to GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v")
  '
  ```

  Alternatively as a root user on the server where tljh is installed, you can do:

  ```bash
  sudo PATH=/opt/tljh/user/bin:${PATH} python3 -c '
  try:
      import jupyter_server_proxy
      is_vulnerable = not hasattr(jupyter_server_proxy, "__version__")
  except:
      is_vulnerable = False
  if is_vulnerable:
      print("WARNING: jupyter-server-proxy __is vulnerable__ to GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v, see https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v.")
  else:
      print("INFO: not vulnerable to GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v")
  '
  ```

  #### 2. Patch detected vulnerability

  As an JupyterHub admin from a terminal in a started user server, you can do:

  ```bash
  sudo -E pip install "jupyter-server-proxy>=3.2.3,!=4.0.0,!=4.1.0"
  ```

  Alternatively as a root user on the server where tljh is installed, you can do:

  ```bash
  sudo PATH=/opt/tljh/user/bin:${PATH} pip install "jupyter-server-proxy>=3.2.3,!=4.0.0,!=4.1.0"
  ```

  #### 3. Consider terminating currently running user servers

  User servers that started before the patch was applied are still vulnerable. To ensure they aren't vulnerable any more you could forcefully terminate their servers via the JupyterHub web interface at `https://<your domain>/hub/admin`.

  </details>

  ### For JupyterHub admins of [Z2JH] installations

  <details><summary>Expand to read more</summary>

  To secure your z2jh deployment's user servers, first consider if one or more user environments is or may be vulnerable, then ensure new user servers' aren't started with the vulnerability, and finally consider terminating currently running user servers. The steps below guide you to do so.

  [z2jh]: https://z2jh.jupyter.org

  #### 1. Check for vulnerabilities

  Consider all docker images that user servers' environment may be based on. If your deployment expose a fixed set of images, you may be able to update them to non-vulnerable versions.

  To check if an individual docker image is vulnerable, use a command like:

  ```bash
  CHECK_IMAGE=jupyter/base-notebook:2023-10-20
  docker run --rm $CHECK_IMAGE python3 -c '
  try:
      import jupyter_server_proxy
      is_vulnerable = not hasattr(jupyter_server_proxy, "__version__")
  except:
      is_vulnerable = False
  if is_vulnerable:
      print("WARNING: jupyter-server-proxy __is vulnerable__ to GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v, see https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v.")
  else:
      print("INFO: not vulnerable to GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v")
  '
  ```

  Note that if you reference an image with a mutable tag, such as `quay.io/jupyter/pangeo-notebook:master`, you should ensure a new version is used by configuring the image pull policy so that an older vulnerable version isn't kept being used because it was already available on a Kubernetes node.

  ```yaml
  singleuser:
    image:
      name: quay.io/jupyter/pangeo-notebook
      tag: master
      # pullPolicy (a.k.a. imagePullPolicy in k8s specification) should be
      # declared to Always if you make use of mutable tags
      pullPolicy: Always
  ```

  #### 2. Patch vulnerabilities dynamically

  If your z2jh deployment still may start vulnerable images for users, you could mount a script that checks and patches the vulnerability before the jupyter server starts.

  Below is JupyterHub Helm chart configuration that relies on [`singleuser.extraFiles`] and [`singleuser.cmd`] to mount a script we use as an entrypoint to dynamically check and patch the vulnerability before jupyter server is started.

  Unless you change it, the script will attempt to upgrade `jupyter-server-proxy` to a non-vulnerable version if needed, and error if it needs to and fails. You can adjust this behavior by adjusting the constants `UPGRADE_IF_VULNERABLE` and `ERROR_IF_VULNERABLE` inside the script.

  [`singleuser.extraFiles`]: https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/resources/reference.html#singleuser-extrafiles
  [`singleuser.cmd`]: https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/resources/reference.html#singleuser-cmd

  ```yaml
  singleuser:
    cmd:
      - /mnt/ghsa-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v/check-patch-run
      - jupyterhub-singleuser

          to `jupyterhub-singleuser` for example.

  #### 3. Consider terminating currently running user servers

  User servers that started before the patch was applied are still vulnerable. To ensure they aren't vulnerable any more you could forcefully terminate their servers via the JupyterHub web interface at `https://<your domain>/hub/admin`.

  </details>

  ## Simple Reproduction

  <details><summary>Expand to read more</summary>

  ### Setup application to proxy

  Make a trivial tornado app that has both websocket and regular HTTP endpoints.

  ```python
  from tornado import websocket, web, ioloop

  class EchoWebSocket(websocket.WebSocketHandler):
      def open(self):
          print("WebSocket opened")

      def on_message(self, message):
          self.write_message(u"You said: " + message)

      def on_close(self):
          print("WebSocket closed")

  class HiHandler(web.RequestHandler):
      def get(self):
          self.write("Hi")

  app = web.Application([
      (r'/ws', EchoWebSocket),
      (r'/hi', HiHandler)
  ])

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.listen(9500)
      ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()
  ```

  ### Setup a clean environment with `jupyter-server-proxy` and start a `jupyter server` instance

  We don't need jupyterlab or anything else here, just `jupyter-server-proxy` would do.

  ```bash
  python -m venv clean-env/
  source clean-env/bin/activate
  pip install jupyter-server-proxy
  jupyter server
  ```

  ### Verify HTTP requests require authentication

  ```bash
  curl -L http://127.0.0.1:8888/proxy/9500/hi
  ```

  This does *not* return the `Hi` response, as expected. Instead, you get the HTML response asking for a token.

  This is secure as intended.

  ### Verify websocket requests doesn't authentication

  The example makes use of [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat) to test websockets. You can use any other tool you are familiar with too.

  ```bash
  websocat ws://localhost:8888/proxy/9500/ws
  ```

  At the terminal, type 'Just testing' and press Enter. You'll get `You said: Just testing` without any authentication required.
