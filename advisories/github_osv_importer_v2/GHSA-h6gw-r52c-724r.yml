summary: "NULL Pointer Dereference and Access of Uninitialized Pointer in TensorFlow\n### Impact\
  \ \nThe [code for boosted trees in TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/stats_ops.cc)\
  \ is still missing validation. This allows malicious users to read and write outside of bounds\
  \ of heap allocated data as well as trigger denial of service (via dereferencing `nullptr`s\
  \ or via `CHECK`-failures).\n\nThis follows after CVE-2021-41208 where these APIs were still\
  \ vulnerable to multiple security issues.\n\n**Note**: Given that the boosted trees implementation\
  \ in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend to no longer use these APIs.  Instead, please\
  \ use the downstream [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests)\
  \ project which is newer and supports more features. \n  \nThese APIs are now deprecated in\
  \ TensorFlow 2.8. We will remove TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs in subsequent releases.\n\
  \  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the known issues in multiple GitHub commits.\n  \nThe fix\
  \ will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow\
  \ 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported\
  \ range.\n\nThis should allow users to use existing boosted trees APIs for a while until they\
  \ migrate to [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests),\
  \ while guaranteeing that known vulnerabilities are fixed.\n\n### For more information\nPlease\
  \ consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)\
  \ for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and\
  \ questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThese vulnerabilities have been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo\
  \ 360 AIVul Team and Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia. Some of the issues\
  \ have been discovered internally after a careful audit of the APIs."
