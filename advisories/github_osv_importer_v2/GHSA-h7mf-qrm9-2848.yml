  - CVE-2007-4556
summary: "OpenSymphony XWork vulnerable to improper input validation\nXWork is an command-pattern\
  \ framework that is used to power WebWork as well as other applications. Struts support in\
  \ OpenSymphony XWork before 1.2.3, and 2.x before 2.0.4, as used in WebWork and Apache Struts,\
  \ recursively evaluates all input as an Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expression\
  \ when altSyntax is enabled, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite\
  \ loop) or execute arbitrary code via form input beginning with a \"%{\" sequence and ending\
  \ with a \"}\" character. \n\nNote: Version 2.0.4 marks the change from `opensymphony:xwork`\
  \ to `com.opensymphony:xwork`."
