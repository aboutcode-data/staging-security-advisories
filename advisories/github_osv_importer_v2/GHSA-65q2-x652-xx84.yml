summary: "dalek-browser-ie downloads Resources over HTTP\nAffected versions of `dalek-browser-ie`\
  \ insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios\
  \ where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response\
  \ and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system\
  \ running `dalek-browser-ie`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for\
  \ this vulnerability, and the package author has marked the package as deprecated.\n\nThe\
  \ best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available.\
  \ \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package\
  \ is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private\
  \ network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised\
  \ your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors\
  \ or Rogue ISP Employees."
