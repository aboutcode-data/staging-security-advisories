summary: |
  Jenkins Repository Connector Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation
  Jenkins Repository Connector Plugin 2.2.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system. A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list the Jenkins controller file system.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
