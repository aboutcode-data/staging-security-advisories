summary: "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in excalidraw's web embed component\n### Summary\n\
  \nA stored XSS vulnerability in Excalidraw's web embeddable component. This allows arbitrary\
  \ JavaScript to be run in the context of the domain where the editor is hosted. \n\n### Poc\n\
  \nInserting an embed with the below url (can be copy/pasted onto canvas to insert as embed)\
  \ will log `42` to the console:\n\n```\nhttps://gist.github.com/vv=v<script>console.log(42)</script>\n\
  ```\n\n### Details\n\nThere were two vectors. One rendering untrusted string as iframe's `srcdoc`\
  \ without properly sanitizing against HTML injection. Second by improperly sanitizing against\
  \ attribute HTML injection. This in conjunction with allowing `allow-same-origin` sandbox\
  \ flag (necessary for several embeds) resulted in the XSS.\n\nFormer was fixed by no longer\
  \ rendering unsafe `srcdoc` content verbatim, and instead strictly parsing the supplied content\
  \ and constructing the `srcdoc` manually. The latter by sanitizing properly.\n\nThe `allow-same-origin`\
  \ flag is now also set only in cases that require it, following the principle of least privilege.\n\
  \n### Impact\n\nThis is a cross site scripting vulnerability, for more information, please\
  \ see: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting\n\nTwo npm `@excalidraw/excalidraw`\
  \ stable version releases were affected (`0.16.x`, `0.17.x`), and both are now patched."
