  - CVE-2016-10533
summary: "Private Data Disclosure in express-restify-mongoose\nAffected versions of `express-restify-mongoose`\
  \ are susceptible to an information leakage vulnerability which may allow an attacker to access\
  \ fields on a model even if those fields are marked as private.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\
  \nIf you have a user model that you want to protect, such as the following User model:\n```\n\
  const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({\n    name: String,\n    password:\
  \ String,\n}));\n```\n\nYou would normally do something such as:\n```\nrestify.serve(router,\
  \ User, {\n    private: ['password'], // Set the password part of User as private, so outside\
  \ people can't read it\n})\n```\n\nThis would hide the password field from people that send\
  \ your application a `GET /User` and `GET /User/some-user-id` request. \n\nA malicious user\
  \ can go to your application and send a request for `GET /User?distinct=password` and get\
  \ all the passwords for all the users in the database, despite the field being set to private.\
  \ This could be used for other private data, if the malicious user knew what was set as private\
  \ for specific routes.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nVersion 2.x: Update to version 2.5.0 or later.\n\
  Version 3.x: Update to version 3.1.0 or later."
