  - CVE-2024-28188
summary: |
  jupyter-scheduler's endpoint is missing authentication
  ### Impact

  `jupyter_scheduler` is missing an authentication check in Jupyter Server on an API endpoint (`GET /scheduler/runtime_environments`) which lists the names of the Conda environments on the server. In affected versions, `jupyter_scheduler` allows an unauthenticated user to obtain the list of Conda environment names on the server. This reveals any information that may be present in a Conda environment name.

  This issue does **not** allow an unauthenticated third party to read, modify, or enter the Conda environments present on the server where `jupyter_scheduler` is running. This issue only reveals the list of Conda environment names.

  Impacted versions: `>=1.0.0,<=1.1.5 ; ==1.2.0 ; >=1.3.0,<=1.8.1 ; >=2.0.0,<=2.5.1`

  ### Patches

  * `jupyter-scheduler==1.1.6`
  * `jupyter-scheduler==1.2.1`
  * `jupyter-scheduler==1.8.2`
  * `jupyter-scheduler==2.5.2`

  ### Workarounds

  Server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-scheduler` extension with:

  ```
  jupyter server extension disable jupyter-scheduler
  ```
