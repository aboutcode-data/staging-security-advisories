summary: "Regular Expression Denial-of-Service in npm schema-inspector\n### Impact\n_What kind\
  \ of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\nEmail address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service\
  \ attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`)\
  \ will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current\
  \ schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do\
  \ email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length,\
  \ etc), are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should\
  \ users upgrade to?_\nUsers should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression\
  \ that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS. The new regex expression is more limited in what it can\
  \ check, so it is more flexible than the one used before. Therefore, this was a new major\
  \ version instead of a new patch version to warn people upgrading that they should make sure\
  \ the email validation still works for their use case. \n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way\
  \ for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nIf a user chooses to\
  \ not upgrade, the only known workaround would be to stop using the email validation feature\
  \ in the library. The user could, for example, accept the email address into their system\
  \ but save it in a \"not yet validated\" state in their system until a verification email\
  \ is sent to it (to determine whether the email is valid and belongs to the form submitter).\
  \ Note that this is the preferred way of validating email addresses anyways.\n\n### References\n\

  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you\
