  amphp/http-server affected by HTTP/2 DDoS vulnerability
  Versions of `amphp/http-server` prior to `3.4.4` for the 3.x release branch and prior to `2.1.10` for the 2.x release branch are vulnerable to the HTTP/2 "MadeYouReset" DoS attack described by CVE-2025-8671 and https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/767506.

  In versions `3.4.4` and `2.1.10`, stream reset protection has been refactored to account for the number of reset streams within a sliding time window.

  Note that your application must expose HTTP/2 connections directly to be affected by this vulnerability. Servers behind a proxy using HTTP/1.x such as nginx are not affected.
