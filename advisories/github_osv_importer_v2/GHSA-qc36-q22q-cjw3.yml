  - CVE-2021-38189
summary: |
  SMTP command injection in lettre
  ### Impact

  Affected versions of lettre allowed SMTP command injection through an attacker's controlled message body. The module for escaping lines starting with a period wouldn't catch a period that was placed after a double CRLF sequence, allowing the attacker to end the current message and write arbitrary SMTP commands after it.

  ### Fix

  The flaw is fixed by correctly handling consecutive CRLF sequences.
