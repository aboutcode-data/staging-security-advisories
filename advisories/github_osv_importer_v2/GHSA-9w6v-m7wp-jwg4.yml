  - CVE-2020-11021
summary: "Http request which redirect to another hostname do not strip authorization header\
  \ in @actions/http-client\n### Impact\nIf consumers of the http-client:\n  1. make an http\
  \ request with an authorization header\n  2. that request leads to a redirect (302) and\n\
  \  3. the redirect url redirects to another domain or hostname \n\nThe authorization header\
  \ will get passed to the other domain.\n\nNote that since this library is for actions, the\
  \ GITHUB_TOKEN that is available in actions is generated and scoped per job with [these permissions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token#permissions-for-the-github_token).\n\
  \n### Patches\nThe problem is fixed in 1.0.8 at [npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/http-client).\
  \  In 1.0.8, the authorization header is stripped before making the redirected request if\
  \ the hostname is different.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/actions/http-client/pull/27\n\
  \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*\
