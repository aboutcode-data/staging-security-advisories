summary: |
  jsx-slack insufficient patch for CVE-2021-43838 ReDoS
  We found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient to save from Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.

  This vulnerability affects to jsx-slack v4.5.1 and earlier versions.

  ### Impact

  If attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources.

  ```javascript
  /** @jsxImportSource jsx-slack */
  import { Section } from 'jsx-slack'

  console.log(
    <Section>
      <blockquote>
        {[...Array(40)].map(() => (
          <p>亜</p>
        ))}
      </blockquote>
    </Section>
  )
  ```

  v4.5.1 has released by passing the test against ASCII characters but missed the case of multibyte characters.

  ### Patches

  jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.
