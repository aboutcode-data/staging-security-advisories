  - CVE-2021-39206
summary: |
  Incorrect Authorization with specially crafted requests
  Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities:

  - [CVE-2021-32777](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32779): incorrectly transform a URL containing a `#fragment` element, causing a mismatch in path-prefix based authorization decisions.
  - [CVE-2021-32779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32777): incorrectly handle duplicate headers, dropping all but the last.  This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions.

  ### Impact
  With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.

  ### Patches

  Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched.

  ### Workarounds

  - This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy.  Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.
