summary: "Snowflake Python Connector vulnerable to Command Injection\n### Issue\nSnowflake was\
  \ informed via our bug bounty program of a command injection vulnerability in the Snowflake\
  \ Python connector via SSO browser URL authentication. \n\n### Impacted driver package: \n\
  snowflake-connector-python\n\n### Impacted version range: \nbefore [Version 3.0.2](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Snowflake-Connector-for-Python-Release-Notes)\n\
  \n### Attack Scenario\nIn order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker\
  \ would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting\
  \ users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible\
  \ server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked\
  \ a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would\
  \ render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. \n\nThis attack scenario\
  \ can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources.   \n\
  \n### Solution\nOn March 23rd, 2023, Snowflake merged a patch that fixed a command injection\
  \ vulnerability in the Snowflake Python connector via SSO browser URL authentication. The\
  \ vulnerability affected the Snowflake Python connector before Version 3.0.2. We strongly\
  \ recommend users upgrade to Version 3.0.2 as soon as possible via the following resources:\
  \ [Snowflake Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector)\n\
  \n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products\
  \ or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne. For more information, please see our\
  \ [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://hackerone.com/snowflake?type=team)."
