summary: "ink! vulnerable to incorrect decoding of storage value when using `DelegateCall`\n\
  ### Summary\nThe return value when using delegate call mechanics, either through [`CallBuilder::delegate`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/4.2.0/ink_env/call/struct.CallBuilder.html#method.delegate)\
  \ or [`ink_env::invoke_contract_delegate`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/4.2.0/ink_env/fn.invoke_contract_delegate.html),\
  \ is being decoded incorrectly.\n\n### Description\nConsider this minimal example:\n\n```rust\n\
  // First contract, this will be performing a delegate call to the `Callee`.\n#[ink(storage)]\n\
  pub struct Caller {\n    value: u128,\n}\n\n#[ink(message)]\npub fn get_value(&self, callee_code_hash:\
  \ Hash) -> u128 {\n    let result = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>()\n        .delegate(callee_code_hash)\n\
  \        .exec_input(ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\n           \
  \ \"get_value\"\n        ))))\n        .returns::<u128>()\n        .invoke();\n\n    result\n\
  }\n\n// Different contract, using this code hash for the delegate call.\n#[ink(storage)]\n\
  pub struct Callee {\n    value: u128,\n}\n\n#[ink(message)]\npub fn get_value(&self) -> u128\
  \ {\n    self.value\n}\n```\n\nIn this example we are executing the `Callee` code in the context\
  \ of the `Caller` contract. This means we'll be using the storage values of the `Caller` contract.\n\
  \nRunning this code we expect the delegate call to return `value` as it was stored in the\
  \ `Caller` contract. However, due to the reported bug a different value is returned (for the\
  \ case of `uint`s it is `256` times the expected value).\n\n### Impact\nAfter conducting an\
  \ analysis of the on-chain deployments of ink! contracts on Astar, Shiden, Aleph Zero, Amplitude\
  \ and Pendulum, we have found that no contracts on those chains have been affected by the\
  \ issue.\n\nThis bug was related to the mechanics around decoding a call's return buffer,\
  \ which was changed as part of https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1450. Since this feature\
  \ was only released in ink! 4.0.0 no previous versions are affected.\n\n### Mitigations\n\
  If you have an ink! 4.x series contract, please update it to the [4.2.1](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases/tag/v4.2.1)\
  \ patch release that we just published. \n\n### Credits\nThank you Facundo Lerena from [CoinFabrik](https://www.coinfabrik.com)\
  \ for reporting this problem in a well-structured and responsible way."
