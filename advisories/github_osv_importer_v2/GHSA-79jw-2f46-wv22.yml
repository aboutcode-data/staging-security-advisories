  - CVE-2022-21705
summary: |
  Authenticated remote code execution in October CMS
  ### Impact

  An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass  `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code.

  - This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions.
  - To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area.

  ### Patches

  The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10.

  ### Workarounds

  Apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 474 or v1.1.10.
