summary: |
  Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions in `wagtail.contrib.settings`
  ### Impact
  Due to an improperly applied permission check in the `wagtail.contrib.settings` module, a user with access to the Wagtail admin and knowledge of the URL of the edit view for a settings model can access and update that setting, even when they have not been granted permission over the model. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.

  ### Patches
  Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.5 and 6.1.2. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected.

  ### Workarounds

  No workaround is available.

  ### Acknowledgements

  Many thanks to Victor Miti for reporting this issue.
