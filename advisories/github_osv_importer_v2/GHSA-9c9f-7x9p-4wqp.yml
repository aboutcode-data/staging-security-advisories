  A malicious coder can get unsound access to TCell or TLCell memory
  This is impossible to do by accident, but by carefully constructing
  marker types to be covariant, a malicious coder can cheat the
  singleton check in `TCellOwner` and `TLCellOwner`, giving unsound
  access to cell memory.  This could take the form of getting two
  mutable references to the same memory, or a mutable reference and an
  immutable reference.

  The fix is for the crate to internally force the marker type to be
  invariant.  This blocks the conversion between covariant types which
  Rust normally allows.
