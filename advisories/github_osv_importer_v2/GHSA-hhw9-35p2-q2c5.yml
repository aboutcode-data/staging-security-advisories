summary: |
  Steam Socialite Provider v1 does not correctly validate openid server
  ### Impact
  The outdated version 1 of the Steam Socialite Provider doesn't check properly if the login comes from `steamcommunity.com`, allowing a malicious actor to substitute their own openID server.

  ### Patches
  This vulnerability only affects the outdated v1.x versions of the package. These are no longer maintained, users should upgrade to v3 or v4, which use a hardcoded endpoint to verify the login.
