summary: |
  array-init-cursor is unsound when used with types that implement `Drop`
  The `Drop` implementation will get run twice when using the cursor.

  This issue does not affect you, if you are using only using the crate with types that are `Copy` such as `u8`.

  This issue also does not affect you, if you are only depending on it through the crate `planus`.
