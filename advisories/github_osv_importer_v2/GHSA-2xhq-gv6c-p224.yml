  - CVE-2020-15114
summary: |
  Etcd Gateway can include itself as an endpoint resulting in resource exhaustion
  ### Vulnerability type
  Denial of Service

  ### Detail
  The etcd gateway is a simple TCP proxy to allow for basic service discovery and access. However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.
