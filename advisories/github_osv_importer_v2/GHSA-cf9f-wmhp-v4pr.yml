  - CVE-2023-48705
summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting potential in custom links, job buttons, and computed fields
  ### Impact

  All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially affected.

  Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content, including:

  - custom links
  - job buttons
  - computed fields

  it is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  We have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed.

  Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there is no direct fix available.
