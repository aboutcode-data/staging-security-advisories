  Unhandled exception when decoding form response JSON
  ### Impact
  When handling form responses from the client (`ModalFormResponsePacket`), the Minecraft Windows client may send weird JSON that `json_decode()` can't understand. A workaround for this is implemented in `InGamePacketHandler::stupid_json_decode()`.

  An `InvalidArgumentException` is thrown by this function when it fails to fix an error found in the JSON, which is not caught by the caller. This leads to a server crash.

  ### Patches
  56fe71d939c38fe14e18a31a673a9331bcc0e4ca

  ### Workarounds
  A plugin may handle `DataPacketReceiveEvent`, capture `ModalFormResponsePacket` and run the provided JSON through `stupid_json_decode`.

  Note that this requires copying the body of the function to a plugin, since the function is currently private.
