  - CVE-2024-52813
summary: |
  matrix-sdk-crypto missing facility to signal rotation of a verified cryptographic identity
  ### Impact

  Versions of the matrix-sdk-crypto Rust crate before 0.8.0 lack a dedicated mechanism to notify that a user's cryptographic identity has changed from a verified to an unverified one, which could cause client applications relying on the SDK to overlook such changes.

  ### Patches

  matrix-sdk-crypto 0.8.0 adds a new `VerificationLevel::VerificationViolation` enum variant which indicates that a previously verified identity has been changed.
