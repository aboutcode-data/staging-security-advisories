aliases:
  - CVE-2017-16113
summary: |
  Regular Expression Denial of Service in parsejson
  Affected versions of `parsejson` are vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service when parsing untrusted user input.


  ## Recommendation

  The `parsejson` package has not been functionally updated since it was initially released.

  Additionally, it provides functionality which is natively included in Node.js, and therefore the native `JSON.parse()` should be used, for both performance and security reasons.
