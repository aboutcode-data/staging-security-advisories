  - CVE-2022-31116
summary: |
  Incorrect handling of invalid surrogate pair characters
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Anyone parsing JSON from an untrusted source is vulnerable.

  JSON strings that contain escaped surrogate characters not part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded incorrectly. Besides corrupting strings, this allowed for potential key confusion and value overwriting in dictionaries.

  Examples:

  ```python
  # An unpaired high surrogate character is ignored.
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uD800"')
  ''
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uD800hello"')
  'hello'

  # An unpaired low surrogate character is preserved.
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uDC00"')
  '\udc00'

  # A pair of surrogates with additional non surrogate characters pair up in spite of being invalid.
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uD800foo bar\uDC00"')
  'foo bar𐀀'
  ```

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Users should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0.

  From version 5.4.0, UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates in the same way as the standard library's `json` module does, preserving them in the parsed output:

  ```python3
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uD800"')
  '\ud800'
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uD800hello"')
  '\ud800hello'
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uDC00"')
  '\udc00'
  >>> ujson.loads(r'"\uD800foo bar\uDC00"')
  '\ud800foo bar\udc00'
  ```

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  Short of switching to an entirely different JSON library, there are no safe alternatives to upgrading.
