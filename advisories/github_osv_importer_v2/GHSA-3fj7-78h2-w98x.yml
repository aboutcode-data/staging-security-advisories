summary: |
  Jenkins XPath Configuration Viewer Plugin Missing Authorization vulnerability
  Jenkins XPath Configuration Viewer Plugin 1.1.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to create and delete XPath expressions.

  Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
