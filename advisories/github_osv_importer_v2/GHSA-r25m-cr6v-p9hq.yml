summary: |
  ethyca-fides Webserver API Path Traversal vulnerability
  ### Impact
  A path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability affects fides versions lower than `2.15.1`, allowing remote attackers to access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem.

  ### Patches
  The vulnerability is patched in fides `2.15.1`. Users should upgrade to this version.

  ### Workarounds
  If the Fides webserver API is not directly accessible to attackers and is instead deployed behind a reverse proxy as recommended in Ethyca's [security best practice documentation](https://docs.ethyca.com/docs/configuration/security-practices#reverse-proxy), and the reverse proxy is an AWS application load balancer, the vulnerability can't be exploited by these attackers. An AWS application load balancer will reject this attack with a 400 error.

  Additionally, any secrets supplied to the container using environment variables rather than a `fides.toml` configuration file are not affected by this vulnerability.
