summary: "eZ Platform Admin UI Password reset vulnerability\nhis Security Update fixes a severe\
  \ vulnerability in the eZ Platform Admin UI, and we recommend that you install it as soon\
  \ as possible. It affects eZ Platform 2.x.\n \nThe functionality for resetting a forgotten\
  \ password is vulnerable to brute force attack. Depending on configuration and other circumstances\
  \ an attacker may exploit this to gain control over user accounts. The update ensures such\
  \ an attack is exceedingly unlikely to succeed.\n \nYou may want to consider a configuration\
  \ change to further strengthen your security. By default a password reset request is valid\
  \ for 1 hour. Reducing this time will make attacks even more difficult, but ensure there is\
  \ enough time left to account for email delivery delays, and user delays. See documentation\
  \ at https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/user_management/#changing-and-recovering-passwords\n\
  \nTo install, use Composer to update to one of the \"Resolving versions\" mentioned above.\
  \ If you use eZ Platform 2.5, update ezsystems/ezplatform-user to v1.0.1. If you use eZ Platform\
  \ 2.4, update ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui to v1.4.6, and ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui-modules\
  \ to v1.4.4, and ezsystems/repository-forms to v2.4.5)"
