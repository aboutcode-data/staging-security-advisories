  - CVE-2023-50726
summary: |
  Users with `create` but not `override` privileges can perform local sync
  ### Impact

  "Local sync" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git.

  An improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is _not_ enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source.

  The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added.

  ### Patches

  The bug has been patched in the following versions:

  * 2.10.3
  * 2.9.8
  * 2.8.12

  ### Workarounds

  To immediately mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass, remove `applications, create` RBAC access. The only way to eliminate the issue without removing RBAC access is to upgrade to a patched version.

  Branch protection rules and review requirements are a great way to enforce security constraints in a GitOps environment, but they should be just one layer in a multi-layered approach. Make sure your AppProject and RBAC restrictions are as thorough as possible to prevent a review bypass vulnerability from permitting excessive damage.
