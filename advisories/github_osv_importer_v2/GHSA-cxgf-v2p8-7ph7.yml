  - CVE-2022-39243
summary: |
  NuProcess vulnerable to command-line injection through insertion of NUL character(s)
  ### Impact
  In all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check.

  This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments on Linux.
  - On macOS, any argument with a NUL character is truncated at that character. This means the malicious arguments are never seen by the started process.
  - On Windows, the entire command line is truncated at the first NUL character. This means the malicious arguments, and any intentional arguments provided after them, are never seen by the started process.

  ### Patches
  2.0.5

  ### Workarounds
  Users of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.

  ### References
  None.
