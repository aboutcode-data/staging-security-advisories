summary: |
  Jupyter Server open redirect vulnerability
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Open redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.

  All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8.

  ### Patches

  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Patched in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix:

  ```
  jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/
  ```
