  1. Delete the package\n2. Clear your npm cache\n3. Ensure it is not present in any other package.json\
  \ files on your system\n4. Regenerate your registry credentials, tokens, and any other sensitive\
  \ credentials that may have been present in your environment variables. \n\nAdditionally,\
  \ any service which may have been exposed via credentials in your environment variables, such\
  \ as a database, should be reviewed for indicators of compromise as well."
