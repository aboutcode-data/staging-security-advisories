  Cosmos packet-forward-middleware vulnerable to chain-halt
  The Cosmos SDK is used for Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) applications and middleware. The [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/tree/main/middleware/packet-forward-middleware) module is an IBC middleware module built for Cosmos blockchains utilizing the IBC protocol allowing routing of incoming IBC packets from a source chain to a destination chain. The `packet-forward-middleware` module is vulnerable to potential chain-halt due to error non-determinism.

  ### Patches
  Please patch at your earliest convenience by applying one of the following patch versions, respective to the chain's ibc-go major version:
