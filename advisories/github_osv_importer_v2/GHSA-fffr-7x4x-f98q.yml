summary: |
  TYPO3 CMS vulnerable to Denial of Service in Page Error Handling
  > ### Meta
  > * CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (5.5)

  ### Problem
  Requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content  to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.

  This vulnerability is the same as described in [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-005](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-005) ([CVE-2021-21359](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21359)). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation.

  ### Solution
  Update to TYPO3 version 11.5.16 that fixes the problem described above.

  ### Credits
  Thanks to Rik Willems who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.
