  - CVE-2014-9772
summary: "XSS Filter Bypass via Encoded URL in validator\nVersions of `validator` prior to 2.0.0\
  \ contained an xss filter method that is affected by several filter bypasses. This may result\
  \ in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\nThe xss() function removes\
  \ the word \"javascript\" when contained inside an attribute.\n\nHowever, it does not properly\
  \ handle cases where characters have been hex-encoded. \n\nAs a result, it is possible to\
  \ build an input that bypasses the filter but which the browser will accept as valid JavaScript.\n\
  \nFor example:\n```<a href=\"jav&#x61;script:...\">abc</a>```\nwill render as:\n```<a href=\"\
  javascript:...\">abc</a>```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe package author has decided to remove\
  \ the xss filter functionality in the latest version of this module. If this feature is not\
  \ currently being used, you are not affected by the vulnerability. If it is being used, updating\
  \ to the latest version of the module will break your application.\n\nIn order for affected\
  \ users to mitigate this vulnerability, it is necessary to use an [alternative package](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=xss%20filter&page=1&ranking=optimal)\
  \ that provides similar functionality."
