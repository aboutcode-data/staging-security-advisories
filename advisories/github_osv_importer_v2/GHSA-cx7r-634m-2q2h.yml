  Cross-Site Scripting in harp
  # Withdrawn

  This advisory has been withdrawn per request from the maintainer.  Given harp is a static webserver, a XSS type of vulnerability is not appropriate.

  ### Original advisory description

  All versions of `harp` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. Due to misconfiguration of its rendering engine, `harp` does not sanitize the HTML output allowing attackers to run arbitrary JavaScript when processing malicious files.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
