summary: |
  Improper random number generation in nanorand
  In versions of nanorand prior to 0.5.1, RandomGen implementations for standard unsigned integers could fail to properly generate numbers, due to using bit-shifting to truncate a 64-bit number, rather than just an as conversion. This often manifested as RNGs returning nothing but 0, including the cryptographically secure ChaCha random number generator.
