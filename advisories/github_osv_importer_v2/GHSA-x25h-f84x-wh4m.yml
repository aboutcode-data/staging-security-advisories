summary: |
  CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins RocketChat Notifier Plugin
  Jenkins RocketChat Notifier Plugin 1.4.10 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

  This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credential.

  Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

  RocketChat Notifier Plugin 1.5.0 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.
