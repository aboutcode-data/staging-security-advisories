summary: "RKE2 allows privilege escalation in Windows nodes due to Insecure Access Control Lists\n\
  ### Impact\n\nA vulnerability has been identified whereby RKE2 deployments in Windows nodes\
  \ have weak Access Control Lists (ACL), allowing `BUILTIN\\Users` or `NT AUTHORITY\\Authenticated\
  \ Users` to view or edit sensitive files which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\nThe\
  \ affected files include binaries, scripts, configuration and log files:\n\n```\nC:\\etc\\\
  rancher\\node\\password\nC:\\var\\lib\\rancher\\rke2\\agent\\logs\\kubelet.log\nC:\\var\\\
  lib\\rancher\\rke2\\data\\v1.**.**-rke2r*-windows-amd64-*\\bin\\*\nC:\\var\\lib\\rancher\\\
  rke2\\bin\\*\n```\n\n**This vulnerability is exclusive to RKE2 in Windows environments. Linux\
  \ environments are not affected by it.**\n\nPlease consult the associated [MITRE ATT&CK -\
  \ Technique - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/)\
  \ for further information about this category of attack.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions\
  \ include RKE2 `1.31.0`, `1.30.2`, `1.29.6`, `1.28.11` and `1.27.15`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nUsers are advised to do a fresh install of their RKE2 Windows nodes using a patched RKE2\
  \ version. \nWhen that is not possible, users can enforce stricter ACLs for all sensitive\
  \ files affected by this Security Advisory running [this](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/blob/master/windows-access-control-lists/README.md)\
  \ PowerShell script as an Administrator on each node.\n\n### References\n\n- [CVE-2023-32197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32197)\n\
