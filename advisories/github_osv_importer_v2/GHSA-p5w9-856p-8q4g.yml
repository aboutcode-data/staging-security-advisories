  Assumed memory layout of std::net::SocketAddr
  The [`socket2`](https://crates.io/crates/socket2) crate has assumed `std::net::SocketAddrV4`
  and `std::net::SocketAddrV6` have the same memory layout as the system C representation
  `sockaddr`. It has simply casted the pointers to convert the socket addresses to the
  system representation. The standard library does not say anything about the memory
  layout, and this will cause invalid memory access if the standard library
  changes the implementation. No warnings or errors will be emitted once the
  change happens.
