summary: "Harden-Runner allows evasion of 'disable-sudo' policy\n### Summary\nHarden-Runner\
  \ includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using\
  \ sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this\
  \ control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact\
  \ with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This\
  \ allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing\
  \ the restriction. \n\nFor an attacker to bypass this control, they would first need the ability\
  \ to run their malicious code (e.g., by a supply chain attack similar to tj-actions or exploiting\
  \ a Pwn Request vulnerability)) on the runner. This vulnerability has been fixed in Harden-Runner\
  \ version `v2.12.0`.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker with the ability to run their malicious code\
  \ on a runner configured with `disable-sudo: true` can escalate privileges to root using Docker,\
  \ defeating the intended security control.\n\n### Affected Configuration\n•\tHarden-Runner\
  \ configurations that use `disable-sudo: true` on GitHub-hosted runners or on ephemeral self-hosted\
  \ VM-based runners.\n•\tThis issue does not apply to Kubernetes-based Actions Runner Controller\
  \ (ARC) Harden-Runner.\n\n### Mitigation / Fix\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in Harden-Runner\
  \ version `v2.12.0`. Users should migrate to the stronger `disable-sudo-and-containers` policy.\
  \ This setting:\n•\tDisables sudo access,\n•\tRemoves access to dockerd and containerd sockets,\n\
  •\tUninstalls Docker from the runner entirely, preventing container-based privilege escalation\
  \ paths.\n\n\n### Additional Improvements\n•\tThe `disable-sudo` option will be deprecated\
  \ in the future, as it does not sufficiently restrict privilege escalation on its own. \n\
  •\tHarden-Runner now includes detections to alert on attempts to evade the `disable-sudo`\
  \ policy.\n\n\n### Credits\nReported by @loresuso and @darryk10. We would like to thank them\
  \ for collaborating with us to mitigate the vulnerability."
