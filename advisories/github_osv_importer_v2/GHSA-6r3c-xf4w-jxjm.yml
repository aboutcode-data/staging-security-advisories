summary: "Spring Framework vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD)\n### Description\n\n\
  In Spring Framework, versions 6.0.x as of 6.0.5, versions 6.1.x and 6.2.x, an application\
  \ is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack when it sets a “Content-Disposition”\
  \ header with a non-ASCII charset, where the filename attribute is derived from user-supplied\
  \ input.\n\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all the following are true:\n\n\
  \  -  The header is prepared with `org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition`.\n  -  The\
  \ filename is set via `ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, Charset)`.\n  -  The value\
  \ for the filename is derived from user-supplied input.\n  -  The application does not sanitize\
  \ the user-supplied input.\n  -  The downloaded content of the response is injected with malicious\
  \ commands by the attacker (see RFD paper reference for details).\n\n\nAn application is not\
  \ vulnerable if any of the following is true:\n\n  -  The application does not set a “Content-Disposition”\
  \ response header.\n  -  The header is not prepared with `org.springframework.http.ContentDisposition`.\n\
  \  -  The filename is set via one of:  \n     - `ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String)`,\
  \ or\n     - `ContentDisposition.Builder#filename(String, ASCII)`\n  -  The filename is not\
  \ derived from user-supplied input.\n  -  The filename is derived from user-supplied input\
  \ but sanitized by the application.\n  -  The attacker cannot inject malicious content in\
  \ the downloaded content of the response.\n\n\n### Affected Spring Products and VersionsSpring\
  \ Framework\n\n  -  6.2.0 - 6.2.7\n  -  6.1.0 - 6.1.20\n  -  6.0.5 - 6.0.28\n  -  Older, unsupported\
  \ versions are not affected\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUsers of affected versions should upgrade\
  \ to the corresponding fixed version.\n\n| Affected version(s) | Fix version | Availability\
  \ |\n| - | - | - |\n| 6.2.x | 6.2.8 | OSS |\n| 6.1.x | 6.1.21 | OSS |\n| 6.0.x | 6.0.29 |\
  \ [Commercial](https://enterprise.spring.io/) |\n\nNo further mitigation steps are necessary."
