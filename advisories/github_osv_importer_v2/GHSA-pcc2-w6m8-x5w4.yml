  - CVE-2023-24429
summary: |
  Agent-to-controller security bypass in Jenkins Semantic Versioning Plugin
  Jenkins Semantic Versioning Plugin 1.14 and earlier does not restrict execution of an controller/agent message to agents, and implements no limitations about the file path that can be parsed, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.
