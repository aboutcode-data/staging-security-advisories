  Command Injection in entitlements
  Versions of `entitlements` prior to 1.3.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate input on the `entitlements` function  and concatenates it to an exec call, allowing attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.3.0 or later.
