  - CVE-2024-47869
summary: "Gradio performs a non-constant-time comparison when comparing hashes\n### Impact \
  \ \n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability involves\
  \ a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function.\
  \ Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring\
  \ the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can\
  \ lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly\
  \ query the system with different keys.\n\n### Patches  \nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>4.44`\
  \ to mitigate this issue.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate\
  \ the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nTo mitigate the risk before applying the patch,\
  \ developers can manually patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard to use a **constant-time\
  \ comparison** function for comparing sensitive values, such as hashes. Alternatively, access\
  \ to the analytics dashboard can be disabled."
