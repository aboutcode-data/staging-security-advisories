summary: "Rancher: Restricted Administrator can change Administrator's passwords\n### Impact\n\
  A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a Restricted Administrator can change\
  \ the password of Administrators and take over their accounts. \n\nA Restricted Administrator\
  \ should be not allowed to change the password of more privileged users unless it contains\
  \ the Manage Users permissions.\n\nRancher deployments where the Restricted Administrator\
  \ role is not being used are not affected by this CVE.\nPlease consult the associated  [MITRE\
  \ ATT&CK - Technique - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/)\
  \ for further information about this category of attack.\n\n### Patches\nThe fix introduces\
  \ a few changes:\n1. If the user has a manage-users verb, the user is allowed to edit/delete\
  \ users. That way the Manage Users built in role will still be able to edit ALL users.\n2.\
  \ If the user doesn't have manage-users, just edit or delete, then there is a check to ensure\
  \ that the User being edited only has rules equal to or less than the editor.\n\nPatched versions\
  \ include releases `v2.8.14`, `v2.9.8`, `v2.10.4` and `v2.11.0`\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers\
  \ are recommended to upgrade, as soon as possible, to a version of Rancher Manager that contains\
  \ the fix.\nIf users can't upgrade, the following are recommended:\n1. Limit access to Rancher\
  \ Restricted Admin only to trusted users.\n2. Downgrade Restricted Administrators to custom\
  \ roles with limited permissions.\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was identified and reported by\
  \ Xavier Duthil from OVHcloud.\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about\
  \ this advisory:\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy)\
