aliases:
  - CVE-2016-10642
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in cmake\nAffected versions of `cmake` insecurely download\
  \ an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has\
  \ a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the\
  \ executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `cmake`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best\
  \ mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available,\
  \ or installing the cmake binaries via a system package manager, such as `apt-get`.\n\nAlternatively,\
  \ the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while\
  \ connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only\
  \ people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or\
  \ those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."
