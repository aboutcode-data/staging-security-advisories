summary: "Potential HTTP policy bypass when using header rules in Cilium\n### Impact\n\nThis\
  \ issue only impacts users who:\n\n- Have a HTTP policy that applies to multiple `toEndpoints`\
  \ AND\n- Have an allow-all rule in place that affects only one of those endpoints\n\nIn such\
  \ cases, a wildcard rule will be appended to the set of HTTP rules, which could cause bypass\
  \ of HTTP policies.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in Cilium 1.11.16, 1.12.9,\
  \ and 1.13.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRewrite HTTP rules for each endpoint separately. For example,\
  \ if the initial rule looks like:\n\n```\n  egress:\n    - toEndpoints:\n        - matchLabels:\n\
  \            k8s:kind: echo\n        - matchLabels:\n            k8s:kind: example\n     \
  \ toPorts:\n        - ports:\n            - port: \"8080\"\n              protocol: TCP\n\
  \          rules:\n            http:\n              - method: \"GET\"\n```\n\nIt should be\
  \ rewritten to:\n \n```\n  egress:\n    - toEndpoints:\n        - matchLabels:\n         \
  \   k8s:kind: echo\n      toPorts:\n        - ports:\n            - port: \"8080\"\n     \
  \         protocol: TCP\n          rules:\n            http:\n              - method: \"GET\"\
  \n    - toEndpoints:\n        - matchLabels:\n            k8s:kind: example\n      toPorts:\n\
  \        - ports:\n            - port: \"8080\"\n              protocol: TCP\n          rules:\n\
  \            http:\n              - method: \"GET\"\n```     \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n\
  The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations.\
  \ Special thanks to @jrajahalme for investigating and fixing the issue.\n\n### For more information\n\
