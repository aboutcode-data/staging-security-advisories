summary: |
  NextAuth.js before 4.10.3 and 3.29.10 sending verification requests (magic link) to unwanted emails
  ### Impact
  `next-auth` users who are using the `EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are affected.

  If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-separated list of emails (eg.: `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint, NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`. This means that basic authorization like `email.endsWith("@victim.com")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address.

  ### Patches
  We patched this vulnerability in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a `normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration, where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance)

  To upgrade, run one of the following:
  ```sh
  npm i next-auth@latest
  ```
  ```sh
  yarn add next-auth@latest
  ```
  ```sh
  pnpm add next-auth@latest
  ```

  (This will update to the latest v4 version, but you can change `latest` to `3` if you want to stay on v3. This is not recommended. v3 is unmaintained.)

  ### Workarounds
  If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can normalize the incoming request like the following, using Advanced Initialization:
  ```ts
  // pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

  function normalize(identifier) {
    // Get the first two elements only,
    // separated by `@` from user input.
    let [local, domain] = identifier.toLowerCase().trim().split("@")
    // The part before "@" can contain a ","
    // but we remove it on the domain part
    domain = domain.split(",")[0]
    return `${local}@${domain}`
  }

  export default async function handler(req, res) {
    if (req.body.email) req.body.email = normalize(req.body.email)
    return await NextAuth(req, res, {/* your options */ })
  }
  ```
