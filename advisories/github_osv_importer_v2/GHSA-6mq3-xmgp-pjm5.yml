summary: "ZITADEL's truncated opaque tokens are still valid\n### Summary\n\nOpaque OIDC access\
  \ tokens in v2 format, truncated to 80 characters are still considered valid. \n\nZITADEL\
  \ uses a symmetric AES encryption for opaque tokens. The cleartext payload is a concatenation\
  \ of a couple of identifiers, such as a token ID and user ID. Internally Zitadel has 2 different\
  \ versions of token payloads. v1 tokens are no longer created, but are still verified as to\
  \ not invalidate existing session after upgrade.\n\nThe cleartext payload has a format of\
  \ `<token_id>:<user_id>`. v2 tokens distinguished further where the `token_id` is of the format\
  \ `v2_<oidc_session_id>-at_<access_token_id>`. This is an example of such a cleartext: `V2_354201447279099906-at_354201447279165442:354201364702363650`\n\
  \n### Impact\n\nV1 token authZ/N session data is retrieved from the database using the (simple)\
  \ `token_id` value and `user_id` value. The `user_id` (called `subject` in some parts of our\
  \ code) was used as being the trusted user ID.\n\nV2 token authZ/N session data is retrieved\
  \ from the database using the `oidc_session_id` and `access_token_id` and in this case the\
  \ `user_id` from the token is ignored and taken from the session data in the database.\n\n\
  By truncating the token to 80 chars, the user_id is now missing from the cleartext of the\
  \ v2 token: `V2_354201447279099906-at_354201447279165442:`  The back-end still accepts this\
  \ for above reasons.\n\nThis issue is not considered exploitable, but may look awkward when\
  \ reproduced.\n\n### Affected Versions\n\nAll versions within the following ranges, including\
  \ release candidates (RCs), are affected:\n- **v4.x**: `4.0.0` through `4.10.1`\n- **3.x**:\
  \ `3.0.0` through `3.4.6`\n- **2.x**: `2.31.0` through `2.71.19`\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability\
  \ has been addressed in the latest releases. The patch resolves the issue by verifying the\
  \ `user_id` from the token against the session data from the database\n\n4.x: Upgrade to >=[4.11.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.11.0)\n\
  3.x: Update to >=[3.4.7](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.7)\n2.x: Update\
  \ to >=[3.4.7](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.7)\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nThe recommended solution is to update ZITADEL to a patched version.\n\n### Questions\n\n\
  If there any questions or comments about this advisory, please send an email to [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n\
  \n### Credits\n\nZITADEL thanks Olivier Becker and Lucas Dodgson for reporting this vulnerability."
