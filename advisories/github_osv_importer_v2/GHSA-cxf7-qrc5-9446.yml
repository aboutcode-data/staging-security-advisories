aliases:
  - CVE-2022-24720
summary: |
  Remote shell execution vulnerability in image_processing
  ### Impact

  When using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input, this allows the attacker to execute shell commands:

  ```rb
  ImageProcessing::Vips.apply({ system: "echo EXECUTED" })
  #>> EXECUTED
  ```

  This method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing.

  ### Workarounds

  If you're processing based on user input, it's highly recommended that you always sanitize the user input, by allowing only a constrained set of operations. For example:

  ```rb
  operations = params[:operations]
    .map { |operation| [operation[:name], *operation[:value]] }
    .select { |name, *| name.to_s.include? %w[resize_to_limit strip ...] } # sanitization

  ImageProcessing::Vips.apply(operations)
  ```
