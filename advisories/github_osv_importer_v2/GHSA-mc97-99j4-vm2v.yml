summary: "Soft Serve Public Key Authentication Bypass Vulnerability when Keyboard-Interactive\
  \ SSH Authentication is Enabled\n### Impact\n\nA security vulnerability in Soft Serve could\
  \ allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass public key authentication when keyboard-interactive\
  \ SSH authentication is active, through the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public key requires\
  \ additional client-side verification for example using FIDO2 or GPG. This is due to insufficient\
  \ validation procedures of the public key step during SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized\
  \ access if the keyboard-interaction mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\
  \ by presenting manipulated SSH requests using keyboard-interactive authentication mode. This\
  \ could potentially result in unauthorized access to the Soft Serve.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers\
  \ should upgrade to the latest Soft Serve version `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this issue.\
  \ \n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo workaround this vulnerability without upgrading, users can _temporarily_\
  \ disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the `allow-keyless` setting.\n\n###\
