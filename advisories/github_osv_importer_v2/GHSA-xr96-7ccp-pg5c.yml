summary: |
  DotNetNuke Vulnerable to XSS in Pass-Through Values
  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the IFrame module before 03.02.01 for DotNetNuke (DNN), caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by an unspecified script. Pass through values were not getting filtered, leaving them vulnerable to XSS.  A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using various parameters in a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
