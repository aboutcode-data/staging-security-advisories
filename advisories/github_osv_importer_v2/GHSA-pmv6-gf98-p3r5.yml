  - CVE-2019-5414
summary: |
  Command Injection in kill-port
  Versions of `kill-port` prior to 1.3.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `kill` function. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system if user input (such as the port number) is passed directly to the function.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.3.2 or later.
