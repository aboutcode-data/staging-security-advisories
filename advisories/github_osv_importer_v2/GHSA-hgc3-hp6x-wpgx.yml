summary: "Antilles Dependency Confusion Vulnerability\n### Potential Impact: \nRemote code execution.\n\
  \n### Scope of Impact: \nOpen-source project specific.\n\n### Summary Description:\nA dependency\
  \ confusion vulnerability was reported in the Antilles open-source software prior to version\
  \ 1.0.1 that could allow for remote code execution during installation due to a package listed\
  \ in requirements.txt not existing in the public package index (PyPi). \nMITRE classifies\
  \ this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package\
  \ dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known\
  \ public repository such as PyPi.\nThe configuration has been updated to only install components\
  \ built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools\
  \ dependency has been published to PyPi.\n\n### Mitigation Strategy for Customers (what you\
  \ should do to protect yourself):\nRemove previous versions of Antilles as a precautionary\
  \ measure and Update to version 1.0.1 or later.\n\n### Acknowledgement:\nThe Antilles team\
  \ thanks Kotko Vladyslav for reporting this issue.\n\n### References:\nhttps://github.com/lenovo/Antilles/commit/c7b9c5740908b343aceefe69733d9972e64df0b9"
