aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5232
summary: |
  Malicious takeover of previously owned ENS names
  ### Impact
  A user who owns an ENS domain can set a "trapdoor", allowing them to transfer ownership to another user, and later regain ownership without the new owner's consent or awareness.

  ### Patches

  A new ENS deployment is being rolled out that fixes this vulnerability in the ENS registry. The registry is newly deployed at [0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e).

  ### Workarounds
  Do not accept transfers of ENS domains from other users on the old registrar.
