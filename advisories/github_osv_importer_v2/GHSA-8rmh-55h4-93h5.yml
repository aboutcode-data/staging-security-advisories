summary: "DSpace ItemImportService API Vulnerable to Path Traversal in Simple Archive Format\
  \ Package Import\n### Impact\nItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability.\
  \ This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory\
  \ to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server.  However, this\
  \ path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either\
  \ Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server).  This vulnerability impacts\
  \ the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line.\n\n_This vulnerability does NOT impact 7.x._\n\n### Patches\n\
  \n_DSpace 6.x:_ \n* Fixed in 6.4 via commit: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7af52a0883a9dbc475cf3001f04ed11b24c8a4c0\n\
  * 6.x patch file: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7af52a0883a9dbc475cf3001f04ed11b24c8a4c0.patch\
  \ (may be applied manually if an immediate upgrade to 6.4 or 7.x is not possible)\n\n_DSpace\
  \ 5.x:_\n* Fixed in 5.11 via commit: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199\n\
  * 5.x patch file: https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199.patch\
  \ (may be applied manually if an immediate upgrade to 5.11 or 6.4 or 7.x is not possible)\n\
  \n#### Apply the patch to your DSpace\nIf at all possible, we recommend upgrading your DSpace\
  \ site based on the upgrade instructions. However, if you are unable to do so, you can manually\
  \ apply the above patches as follows:\n1. Download the appropriate patch file to the machine\
  \ where DSpace is running\n2. From the `[dspace-src]` folder, apply the patch, e.g. `git apply\
  \ [name-of-file].patch`\n3. Now, update your DSpace site (based loosely on the Upgrade instructions).\
  \ This generally involves three steps:\n    1. Rebuild DSpace, e.g. `mvn -U clean package`\
  \  (This will recompile all DSpace code)\n    2. Redeploy DSpace, e.g. `ant update`  (This\
  \ will copy all updated WARs / configs to your installation directory). Depending on your\
  \ setup you also may need to copy the updated WARs over to your Tomcat webapps folder.\n \
  \   3. Restart Tomcat\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a basic workaround, you may block all access\
  \ to the following URL paths:\n* If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to `/admin/batchimport`\
  \ path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the\
  \ path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access to `/xmlui/admin/batchimport`.\n* If you\
  \ are using the JSPUI, block all access to `/dspace-admin/batchimport` path (this is the URL\
  \ of the Admin Batch Import tool).  Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/jspui\", then\
  \ you'd need to block access to `/jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport`.\n\nKeep in mind, only an\
  \ Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload\
  \ SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages,\
  \ then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n\n### For more\
