summary: |
  Incorrect Authorization in serverless-offline
  Serverless Offline 8.0.0 returns a 403 HTTP status code for a route that has a trailing `/` character, which might cause a developer to implement incorrect access control, because the actual behavior within the Amazon AWS environment is a 200 HTTP status code (i.e., possibly greater than expected permissions).
