  Memory over-allocation in evm-core
  Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related
  to memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the
  crate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it
  possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack.

  The flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`.
