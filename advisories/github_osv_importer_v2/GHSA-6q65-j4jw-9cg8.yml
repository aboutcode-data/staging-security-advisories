  DotVVM allows path traversal when deployed in Debug mode
  ### Description

  There is a path traversal vulnerability in any DotVVM application started in Debug mode, if at least one resource with the `FileResourceLocation` has been added. The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the filesystem accessible by the web application (i.e. appsettings.json or other files containing secrets).

  ### Patches

  The bug is patched in versions  **4.2.10**, **4.3.8** and **5.0.0-preview03-final** (and newer).

  Apart from updating DotVVM, it is also recommend invalidating any secrets which could have been leaked by an application deployed in Debug mode (such as database passwords).

  ### Workarounds

  If you cannot update to a patched version, avoid running a publicly accessible DotVVM application in Debug mode (Development environment in Asp.Net Core). It is recommend adding the following statement to the DotvvmStartup class:

  ```
      config.Debug = false; // TODO: workaround for GHSA-6q65-j4jw-9cg8, remove after updating DotVVM
  ```
