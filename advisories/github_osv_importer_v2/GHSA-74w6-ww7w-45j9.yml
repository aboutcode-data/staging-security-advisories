  The Indexed Search Engine (indexed_search) system extension in TYPO3 4.0.0 through 4.0.9, 4.1.0 through 4.1.7, and 4.2.0 through 4.2.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted filename containing shell metacharacters, which is not properly handled by the command-line indexer.
