summary: "Potential segfault in `localtime_r` invocations\n### Impact\n\nUnix-like operating\
  \ systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in specific circumstances.\
  \ This requires an environment variable to be set in a different thread than the affected\
  \ functions. This may occur without the user's knowledge, notably in a third-party library.\n\
  \n### Workarounds \n\nNo workarounds are known."
