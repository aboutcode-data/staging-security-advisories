summary: |
  OpenFGA Authorization Bypass
  ### Overview
  During our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions v0.2.4 and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.

  ### Am I Affected?
  You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version v0.2.4 or prior, and have tuples where the `user` field is set to a `userset` e.g. `folder:test#owner`, and the tuple's relation is used on the right-hand side of a `from` statement.

  ### How to fix that?
  Upgrade to version 0.2.5.

  ### Backward Compatibility
  This update is not backward compatible.
  Any tuples where the `user` field is set to a `userset`, and the tuple's relation is used on the right-hand side of a `from` statement have to be rewritten.
