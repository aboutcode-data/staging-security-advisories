aliases:
  - CVE-2020-5301
summary: |
  Information disclosure of source code in SimpleSAMLphp
  ### Background

  The module controller in `SimpleSAML\Module` that processes requests for pages
  hosted by modules, has code to identify paths ending with `.php` and process
  those as PHP code. If no other suitable way of handling the given path exists it
  presents the file to the browser.

  ### Description

  The check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for uppercase
  letters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server is
  serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the
  processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead
  presented to the browser.

  ### Affected versions

  SimpleSAMLphp versions **1.18.5 and older**.

  ### Impact

  An attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in third-party
  modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive. However, the attack
  surface is considered small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp
  serves such content from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on
  Windows.

  ### Resolution

  Upgrade the SimpleSAMLphp installation to version **1.18.6**.

  ### Credit

  This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Sławek Naczyński.
