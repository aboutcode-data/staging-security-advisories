  - CVE-2016-10530
summary: |
  Insecure Default Configuration in airbrake
  Affected versions of `airbrake` default to sending environment variables over an unencrypted HTTP connection. In scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible for them to capture and read these environment variables, which may result in leaking sensitive information.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 0.4.0 or later, or upgrade from the now-deprecated `airbrake` module to its replacement, [`airbrake-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airbrake-js).
