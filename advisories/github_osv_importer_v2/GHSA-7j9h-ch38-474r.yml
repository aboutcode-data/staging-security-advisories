  Withdrawn Advisory: Stored Cross-site scripting affecting automad/automad
  ## Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because only the main admin with the highest level of privilege can provide input, and there are no users other than the admin from whom data could be stolen. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  automad up to 1.10.9 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in the `sitename` argument because the `SharedController` class that handles form data and saving shared information does not properly sanitize the user input on the client side when rendering the data. The attack may be launched remotely and an exploit has been disclosed publicly.
