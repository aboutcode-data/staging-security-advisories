summary: |
  Remote code execution vulnerability in dependency System.Drawing.Common
  ### Impact

  The core Akka module depended on an old System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager version 4.7.0 which transitively depends on System.Common.Drawing v4.7.0. The System.Common.Drawing v4.7.0 is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghhp-997w-qr28.

  The real-world impact of this should be low, but users should be advised to upgrade to later versions of Akka.NET.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  This issue is resolved in Akka.NET v1.4.46 and Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha3.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  You might be able to explicitly reference System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager's NuGet package and upgrade to 6.0.1 or later without upgrading Akka.NET, but it's probably best to upgrade Akka.NET itself.

  ### References
  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_
