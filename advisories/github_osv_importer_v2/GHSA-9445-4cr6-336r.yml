summary: "Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack\nThere is a vulnerability in Action Controller’s\
  \ redirect_to. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22797.\n\n\
  Versions Affected: >= 7.0.0 Not affected: < 7.0.0 Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.1\nImpact \n\nThere\
  \ is a possible open redirect when using the redirect_to helper with untrusted user input.\n\
  \nVulnerable code will look like this:\n```\nredirect_to(params[:some_param])\n```\n\nRails\
  \ 7.0 introduced protection against open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted\
  \ user input. In prior versions the developer was fully responsible for only providing trusted\
  \ input. However the check introduced could be bypassed by a carefully crafted URL.\n\nAll\
  \ users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\
  Releases\n\nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.\nWorkarounds\n\nThere\
  \ are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\nPatches\n\nTo aid users who aren’t able to\
  \ upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They\
  \ are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n    7-0-Fix-sec-issue-with-_url_host_allowed.patch\
  \ - Patch for 7.0 series\n\nPlease note that only the 7.0.Z and 6.1.Z series are supported\
  \ at present, and 6.0.Z for severe vulnerabilities. Users of earlier unsupported releases\
  \ are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability\
  \ of security fixes for unsupported releases."
