  Mattermost versions 11.1.x <= 11.1.2, 10.11.x <= 10.11.9, 11.2.x <= 11.2.1 fail to validate user permissions when creating Jira issues from Mattermost posts, which allows an authenticated attacker with access to the Jira plugin to read post content and attachments from channels they do not have access to via the /create-issue API endpoint by providing the post ID of an inaccessible post..
