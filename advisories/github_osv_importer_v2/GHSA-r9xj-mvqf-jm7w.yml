summary: "bagisto has Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Create New Customer\n### Summary\nIn Bagisto\
  \ v2.3.7, the “Create New Customer” feature (in the admin panel) is vulnerable to reflected\
  \ / stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker with access to the admin create-customer\
  \ form can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into certain input fields. These payloads\
  \ may later execute in the context of an admin’s browser or another user viewing the customer\
  \ data, enabling session theft or admin-level actions.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability arises\
  \ because certain input fields are not properly sanitized or escaped when rendering customer\
  \ data in the admin UI. The form data is stored in the database (i.e. it is stored XSS), and\
  \ later when customer records are displayed (e.g. in a grid, detail view, or listing), the\
  \ input is interpolated into HTML without encoding or filtering. \n\n### PoC\nNavigate to\
  \ sales orders, and create a new customer.\n<img width=\"643\" height=\"567\" alt=\"image\"\

  \ />\n<img width=\"1336\" height=\"404\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d45913ea-b177-4926-8612-92518e12f11e\"\
  \ />\n\n\n### Impact\nStored XSS vulnerability — malicious script persisted in database and\
  \ executed when viewing the data. An attacker (with limited privilege) could inject JavaScript\
  \ that runs in the browser of an admin or user who views injected customer records. The script\
  \ can steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of admin, escalate privileges, or pivot\
  \ into further attacks. In an e-commerce admin system, this is high severity due to potential\
  \ access to customer data, order management, or site configuration."
