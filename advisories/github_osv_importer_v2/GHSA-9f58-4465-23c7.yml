aliases:
  - CVE-2025-62798
summary: |
  Sharp user-provided input can be evaluated in a SharpShowTextField with Vue template syntax
  A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in code16/sharp when rendering content using the SharpShowTextField component.

  In affected versions, expressions wrapped in `{{` & `}}` were evaluated by Vue. This allowed attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML that executes in the browser when the field is displayed.

  For example, if a field’s value contains `{{ Math.random() }}`, it will be executed instead of being displayed as text.

  ### Impact

  Attackers who can control content rendered through SharpShowTextField could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an authenticated user’s browser.

  This could lead to:

  - Theft of user session tokens.
  - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users.
  - Injection of malicious content into the admin panel.

  ### Patches

  The issue has been fixed in v9.11.1 of code16/sharp package.

  ### Mitigation / Workarounds

  Sanitize or encode any user-provided data that may include (`{{` & `}}`) before displaying it in a SharpShowTextField.
