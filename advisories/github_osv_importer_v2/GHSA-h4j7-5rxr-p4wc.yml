  ## Advisory FAQ

  ### <a name="how-affected"></a>How do I know if I am affected?

  If you have a .NET SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.

  ### <a name="how-fix"></a>How do I fix the issue?

  1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 SDK or .NET 8.0 SDK. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.
  2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.

  * You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;
