  - CVE-2016-10541
summary: "Potential Command Injection in shell-quote\nAffected versions of `shell-quote` do\
  \ not properly escape command line arguments, which may result in command injection if the\
  \ library is used to escape user input destined for use as command line arguments.\n\n\n\n\
  ## Proof of Concept:\n\nThe following characters are not escaped properly: `>`,`;`,`{`,`}`\n\
  \nBash has a neat but not well known feature known as \"Bash Brace Expansion\", wherein a\
  \ sub-command can be executed without spaces by running it between a set of `{}` and using\
  \ the `,` instead of ` ` to seperate arguments. Because of this, full command injection is\
  \ possible even though it was initially thought to be impossible. \n\n```\n   const quote\
  \ = require('shell-quote').quote;\n   console.log(quote(['a;{echo,test,123,234}']));\n   //\
  \ Actual                    \"a;{echo,test,123,234}\"\n   // Expected                  \"\
  a\\;\\{echo,test,123,234\\}\"\n   // Functional Equivalent     \"a; echo 'test' '123' '1234'\"\
  \n```\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.6.1 or later."
