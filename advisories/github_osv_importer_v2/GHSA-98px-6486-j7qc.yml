  - CVE-2023-32683
summary: |
  Synapse has URL deny list bypass via oEmbed and image URLs when generating previews
  ### Impact
  A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the `url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (by default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information returned to the client:

  * For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded.
  * For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is discarded.

  Systems which have URL preview disabled (via the `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a `url_preview_url_blacklist` are not affected.

  Because of the uncommon configuration required, the limited information a malicious user, and the amount of guesses/time the attack would need; the severity is rated as low.

  ### Patches

  The issue is fixed by #15601.

  ### Workarounds

  The default configuration of the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` should protect against requests being made to internal infrastructure, URL previews of public URLs is expected.

  Alternately URL previews could be disabled using the `url_preview_enabled` setting.
