summary: |
  Directus's webhook trigger flows can leak sensitive data
  ### Describe the Bug

   In Directus, when a **Flow** with the "_Webhook_" trigger and the "_Data of Last Operation_" response body encounters a ValidationError thrown by a failed condition operation, the API response includes sensitive data. This includes environmental variables, sensitive API keys, user accountability information, and operational data.

  This issue poses a significant security risk, as any unintended exposure of this data could lead to potential misuse.

  ### To Reproduce

  **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Create a Flow in Directus with:
     - Trigger: Webhook
     - Response Body: Data of Last Operation
  2. Add a condition that is likely to fail.
  3. Trigger the Flow with any input data that will fail the condition.
  4. Observe the API response, which includes sensitive information like:
     - Environmental variables (`$env`)
     - Authorization headers
     - User details under `$accountability`
     - Previous operational data.

  **Expected Behavior:**
  In the event of a ValidationError, the API response should only contain relevant error messages and details, avoiding the exposure of sensitive data.

  **Actual Behavior:**
  The API response includes sensitive information such as:
  - Environment keys (`FLOWS_ENV_ALLOW_LIST`)
  - User accountability (`role`, `user`, etc.)
  - Operational logs (`current_payments`, `$last`), which might contain private details.
