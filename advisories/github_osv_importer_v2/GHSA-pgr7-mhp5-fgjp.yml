summary: |
  vLLM deserialization vulnerability in vllm.distributed.GroupCoordinator.recv_object
  vllm-project vllm version 0.6.0 contains a vulnerability in the distributed training API. The function vllm.distributed.GroupCoordinator.recv_object() deserializes received object bytes using pickle.loads() without sanitization, leading to a remote code execution vulnerability.

  ### Maintainer perspective
  Note that vLLM does NOT use the code as described in the report on huntr. The problem only exists if you use these internal APIs in a way that exposes them to a network as described. The vllm team was not involved in the analysis of this report and the decision to assign it a CVE.
