  Better Auth URL parameter HTML Injection (Reflected Cross-Site scripting)
  ### Summary
  The better-auth `/api/auth/error` page was vulnerable to HTML injection, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

  ### Details
  The value of `error` URL parameter was reflected as HTML on the error page: https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/blob/05ada0b79dbcac93cc04ceb79b23ca598d07830c/packages/better-auth/src/api/routes/error.ts#L81

  ### Impact
  An attacker who exploited this vulnerability by coercing a user to visit a specially-crafted URL could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser.
