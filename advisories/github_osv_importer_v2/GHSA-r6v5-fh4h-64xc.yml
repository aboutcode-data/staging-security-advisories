aliases:
  - CVE-2026-25727
summary: |
  time vulnerable to stack exhaustion Denial of Service attack
  ### Impact

  When user-provided input is provided to any type that parses with the RFC 2822 format, a Denial of Service attack via stack exhaustion is possible. The attack relies on formally deprecated and rarely-used features that are part of the RFC 2822 format used in a malicious manner. Ordinary, non-malicious input will never encounter this scenario.

  ### Patches

  A limit to the depth of recursion was added in v0.3.47. From this version, an error will be returned rather than exhausting the stack.

  ### Workarounds

  Limiting the length of user input is the simplest way to avoid stack exhaustion, as the amount of the stack consumed would be at most a factor of the length of the input.
