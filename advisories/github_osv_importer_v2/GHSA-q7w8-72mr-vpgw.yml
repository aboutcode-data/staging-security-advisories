aliases:
  - CVE-2024-42488
summary: |
  Policy bypass for Host Firewall policy due to race condition in Cilium agent
  ### Impact

  A race condition in the Cilium agent can cause the agent to ignore labels that should be applied to a node. This could in turn cause CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies intended for nodes with the ignored label to not apply, leading to policy bypass.

  ### Patches

  This issue was fixed in https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/33511.

  This issue affects:

  - All versions of Cilium before v1.14.14
  - Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.7 inclusive

  This issue has been patched in:

  - Cilium v1.14.14
  - Cilium v1.15.8

  ### Workarounds

  As the underlying issue depends on a race condition, users unable to upgrade can restart the Cilium agent on affected nodes until the affected policies are confirmed to be working as expected.

  ### Acknowledgements

  The Cilium community has worked together with members of Google and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @skmatti for raising and resolving this issue.
