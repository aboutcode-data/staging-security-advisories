summary: "Rancher does not Properly Validate Account Bindings in SAML Authentication Enables\
  \ User Impersonation on First Login\n### Impact\nA vulnerability in Rancher has been discovered,\
  \ leading to a local user impersonation through SAML Authentication on first login.\n\nThe\
  \ issue occurs when a SAML authentication provider (AP) is configured (e.g. Keycloak). A newly\
  \ created AP user can impersonate any user on Rancher by manipulating cookie values during\
  \ their initial login to Rancher. This vulnerability could also be exploited if a Rancher\
  \ user (present on the AP) is removed, either manually or automatically via the [User Retention\
  \ feature](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/enable-user-retention)\
  \ with delete-inactive-user-after.\n\nMore precisely, Rancher validates only a subset of input\
  \ from the SAML assertion request; however, it trusts and uses values that are not properly\
  \ validated. An attacker could then configure the saml_Rancher_UserID cookie and the saml_Rancher_Action\
  \ cookie so that the user principal from the AP will be added to the user specified by the\
  \ attacker (from saml_Rancher_UserID). Rancher can then be deceived by setting saml_Rancher_UserID\
  \ to the admin's user ID and saml_Rancher_Action to testAndEnable, thereby executing the vulnerable\
  \ code path and leading to privilege escalation.\n\nNote that the vulnerability impacts all\
  \ SAML APs available in Rancher. However the following Rancher deployments are not affected:\n\
  1. Rancher deployments not using SAML-based AP.\n2. Rancher deployments using SAML-based AP,\
  \ where all SAML users are already signed in and linked to a Rancher account.\n\nPlease consult\
  \ the associated  [MITRE ATT&CK - Technique - Access Token Manipulation: Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001/)\
  \ for further information about this category of attack.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability\
  \ is addressed by adding the UserID claim to a JWT signed token, which is protected against\
  \ tampering. \n\nPatched versions include releases `v2.8.13`, `v2.9.7` and `v2.10.3`.\n\n\
  ### Workarounds\nRancher deployments that can't upgrade, could temporarily disable the SAML-based\
  \ AP as a temporary workaround. However, upgrading is recommended.\n\n### References\nIf you\
  \ have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security\
  \ team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n\
