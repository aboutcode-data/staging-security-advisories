summary: |
  Tauri vulnerable to Regression on Filesystem Scope Checks for Dotfiles
  ### Impact
  The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Linux and macOS.

  Previously dotfiles (eg. `$HOME/.ssh/`) were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented and dotfiles were implicitly allowed.

  Only Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected.
  Only macOS and Linux systems are affected.

  ### Patches
  The regression has been patched on `v1.4.1`.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no known workarounds at this time, users should update to `v1.4.1` immediately.
