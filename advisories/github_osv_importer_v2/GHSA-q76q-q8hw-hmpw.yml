aliases:
  - CVE-2022-31671
summary: |
  ### Impact
  Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when reading job execution logs through the P2P preheat execution logs - API call

    GET /projects/{project_name}/preheat/policies/{preheat_policy_name}/executions/{execution_id}/tasks/{task_id}/logs

  By sending a request that attempts to read P2P preheat execution logs and specifying different job ids, malicious authenticatedusers could read all the job logs stored in the Harbor database.

  ### Patches
  This and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

  ### Workarounds
  There are no workarounds available.
