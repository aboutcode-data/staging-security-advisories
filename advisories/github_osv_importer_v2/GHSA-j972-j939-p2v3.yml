summary: |
  quic-go Has Panic in Path Probe Loss Recovery Handling
  ### Impact

  The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client.

  In order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference.

  ### Patches

  v0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability.

  This release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch actually covers all corner cases.

  ### Workarounds

  No.
