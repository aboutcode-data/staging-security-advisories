summary: |
  TinyEnv: Inline comments not stripped properly in .env values
  ### Impact
  TinyEnv did not properly strip inline comments inside .env values. This could lead to unexpected behavior or misconfiguration, where variables contain unintended characters (including # or comment text). Applications depending on strict environment values may expose logic errors, insecure defaults, or failed authentication.

  ### Patches
  Fixed in v1.0.11. Users should upgrade to the latest patched version.

  ### Workarounds
  As a temporary workaround, avoid using inline comments in .env files, or sanitize loaded values manually.
