summary: "n8n has OS Command Injection in Git Node\n## Impact\n\nVulnerabilities in the Git\
  \ node allowed authenticated users with permission to create or modify workflows to execute\
  \ arbitrary system commands or read arbitrary files on the n8n host.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe\
  \ issue has been fixed in n8n versions 2.5.0, and 1.123.10. Users should upgrade to this version\
  \ or later to remediate the vulnerability.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately\
  \ possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n\n- Limit\
  \ workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Restrict or disable\
  \ access to the Git node if not essential for operations.\n- Deploy n8n in a hardened environment\
  \ with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential\
  \ exploitation.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used\
  \ as short-term mitigation measures.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [n8n Documentation — Blocking nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) —\
  \ how to globally disable specific nodes\n\n--- \n\nn8n has adopted CVSS 4.0 as primary score\
  \ for all security advisories. CVSS 3.1 vector strings are provided for backward compatibility.\n\
