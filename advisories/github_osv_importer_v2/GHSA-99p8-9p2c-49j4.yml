summary: |
  Improper Access Control in Onionshare
  Between September 26, 2021 and October 8, 2021, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) conducted a penetration test of OnionShare 2.4, funded by the Open Technology Fund's [Red Team lab](https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/). This is an issue from that penetration test.

  - Vulnerability ID: OTF-009
  - Vulnerability type: Improper Access Control
  - Threat level: Low

  ## Description:

  Authenticated users (or unauthenticated in public mode) can send messages without being visible in the list of chat participants.

  ## Technical description:

  Prerequisites:

  - Existing chatroom
  - Access to the chatroom (Public or known Private Key)
  - Either a modified frontend client or manual requests from burp/curl

  If a user opens the chatroom without emitting the join message he will not be present in session.users[x] list. Therefore there is no listing in the frontend and no chat participant knows another party joined the chat. It is still possible to send messages in the chatroom.

  If a user decides to abuse OTF-003 (page 22) he can impersonate messages from existing users; others would not be able to distinguish original and faked messages. This is also a prerequisite for OTF-004 (page 19).

  ## Impact:

  An adversary with access to the chat environment can send messages to the chat without being visible in the list of chat participants.

  ## Recommendation:

  - Allow chat access only after emission of the join event.
  - Implement proper session handling.
