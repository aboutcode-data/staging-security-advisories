summary: "python-socketio vulnerable to arbitrary Python code execution (RCE) through malicious\
  \ pickle deserialization in certain multi-server deployments\n### Summary\nA remote code execution\
  \ vulnerability in python-socketio versions prior to 5.14.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary\
  \ Python code through malicious pickle deserialization in multi-server deployments on which\
  \ the attacker previously gained access to the message queue that the servers use for internal\
  \ communications.\n\n### Details\nWhen Socket.IO servers are configured to use a message queue\
  \ backend such as Redis for inter-server communication, messages sent between the servers\
  \ are encoded using the `pickle` Python module. When a server receives one of these messages\
  \ through the message queue, it assumes it is trusted and immediately deserializes it.\n\n\
  The vulnerability stems from deserialization of messages using Python's `pickle.loads()` function.\
  \ Having previously obtained access to the message queue, the attacker can send a python-socketio\
  \ server a crafted pickle payload that executes arbitrary code during deserialization via\
  \ Python's `__reduce__` method.\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability only affects deployments\
  \ with a compromised message queue. The attack can lead to the attacker executing random code\
  \ in the context of, and with the privileges of a Socket.IO server process. \n\nSingle-server\
  \ systems that do not use a message queue, and multi-server systems with a secure message\
  \ queue are not vulnerable.\n\n### Remediation\nIn addition to making sure standard security\
  \ practices are followed in the deployment of the message queue, users of the python-socketio\
  \ package can upgrade to version 5.14.0 or newer, which remove the `pickle` module and use\
  \ the much safer JSON encoding for inter-server messaging."
