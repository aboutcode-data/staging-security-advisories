  Command Injection in wxchangba
  All versions of `wxchangba` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `reqPostMaterial` function, passing contents of the `file` parameter to an exec call. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
