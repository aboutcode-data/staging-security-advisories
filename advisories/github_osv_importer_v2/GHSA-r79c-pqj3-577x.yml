summary: "Super-linter is vulnerable to command injection via crafted filenames in Super-linter\
  \ Action\n### Summary\n\nThe Super-linter GitHub Action is vulnerable to **command injection\
  \ via crafted filenames**. When this action is used in downstream GitHub Actions workflows,\
  \ an attacker can submit a pull request that introduces a file whose **name** contains shell\
  \ command substitution syntax, such as `$(...)`. In affected Super-linter versions, runtime\
  \ scripts may execute the embedded command during file discovery processing, enabling arbitrary\
  \ command execution in the workflow runner context. This can be used to disclose the job’s\
  \ `GITHUB_TOKEN` depending on how the workflow configures permissions.\n\n### Details\n\n\
  The issue appears originates in the logic that scans the repository for changed files to check.\n\
  \n1. Use a workflow that runs Super-linter on `pull_request` events.\n2. Open a pull request\
  \ that adds a new file with a crafted filename containing command substitution and an outbound\
  \ request that includes `$GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n3. Run the workflow.  \n\n### Impact\n\n- **Arbitrary\
  \ command execution** in the context of the workflow run that invokes Super-linter (triggered\
  \ by attacker-controlled filenames in a PR).\n- **Credential exposure / misuse:** the injected\
  \ command can read environment variables available to the action, including `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n\
  \nThe level of exposure depends on the source of the pull request.\n\nTo actively exploit\
  \ the vulnerability, an attacker needs have the ability to run workflows without any [approval\
  \ from the repository admin](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/approve-runs-from-forks).\n\
  \nAlso, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to have unconstrained access to repository resources. Even\
  \ in that case, for pull request coming from forked repositories, no secrets are passed to\
  \ the forked repository when running workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, and the\
  \ `GITHUB_TOKEN` drops and write permission on the source repository [source](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflows-in-forked-repositories).\n\
  \nFinally, although not specific to this vulnerability, we recommend auditing `workflow_call`\
  \ and `pull_request_target` workflows because they can lead to compromise, regardless of whether\
  \ you're using Super-linter, or not, as [explained by this GitHub Enterprise doc](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/reference/security/secure-use#mitigating-the-risks-of-untrusted-code-checkout)."
