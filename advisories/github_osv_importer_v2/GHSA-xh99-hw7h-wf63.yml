  Unchecked validity of Facing values in PlayerActionPacket
  ### Impact
  A remote attacker may crash a server by sending `PlayerActionPacket` with invalid facing values (e.g. negative), specifically with `START_BREAK` or `CRACK_BLOCK` actions, or with a `UseItemTransactionData` (typically in `InventoryTransactionPacket`).

  ### Patches
  f126479c37ff00a717a828f5271cf8e821d12d6c

  ### Workarounds
  Using a plugin, cancel `DataPacketReceiveEvent` if the packet is `PlayerActionPacket` and the facing is outside the range 0-5 when receiving START_BREAK or CRACK_BLOCK actions, or UseItemTransactionData. However, beware that negative values may be legitimate in some cases.
