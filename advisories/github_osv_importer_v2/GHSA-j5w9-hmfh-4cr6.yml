  - CVE-2023-25671
summary: |
  TensorFlow has segmentation fault in tfg-translate
  ### Impact
  Out-of-bounds access due to mismatched integer type sizes in ValueMap::Manager::GetValueOrCreatePlaceholder. Bug with tfg-translate call to InitMlir. The problem happens with generic functions, as it is already handled for non-generic functions. This is because they, unlike non-generic functions, are using the "old importer". A better long-term solution may be to have the "new importer" handle generic functions.
