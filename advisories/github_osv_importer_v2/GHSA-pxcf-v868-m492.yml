  Injection and Cross-site Scripting in osm-static-maps
  This affects all versions of package osm-static-maps under 3.9.0. User input given to the package is passed directly to a template without escaping `({{{ ... }}})`.

It will be outputted as an HTML on the page which gives opportunity for XSS or rendered on the server (puppeteer) which also gives opportunity for SSRF and Local File Read.
