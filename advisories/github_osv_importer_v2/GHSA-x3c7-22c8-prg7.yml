  - CVE-2025-49597
summary: |
  handcraftedinthealps/goodby-csv has Potential Gadget Chain allowing Remote Code Execution
  ### Impact

  goodby-csv could be used as part of a chain of methods that is exploitable when an insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in an application. This so-called "gadget chain" presents no direct threat but is a vector that can be used to achieve remote code execution if the application deserializes untrusted data due to another vulnerability.

  ### Patches

  Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?

  The problem is patched with Version 1.4.3

  ### Workarounds

  Patch `src/Goodby/CSV/Export/Standard/Collection /CallbackCollection.php`:

  ```diff
  +    public function __wakeup() {
  +       throw new \BadMethodCallException('Cannot unserialize ' . __CLASS__);
  +    }
  ```

  However, this is not directly exploitable; a separate vulnerability must be present to allow an attacker to pass unsafe input to unserialize(). There are no such known exploits in goodby-csv.
