  - CVE-2023-29205
summary: "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-xwiki vulnerable to stored cross-site\
  \ scripting via HTML and raw macro\n### Impact\n\nThe HTML macro does not systematically perform\
  \ a proper neutralization of script-related html tags. As a result, any user able to use the\
  \ html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS attack. This can be particularly dangerous\
  \ since in a standard wiki, any user is able to use the html macro directly in their own user\
  \ profile page. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1. The patch\
  \ involve that the HTML macro are systematically cleaned up whenever the user does not have\
  \ script right. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround for this issue.\n\n### For more\
  \ information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue\
  \ in [Jira](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)"
