summary: "Gradio's dropdown component pre-process step does not limit the values to those in\
  \ the dropdown list\n### Impact\n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\n\
  This vulnerability is a **data validation issue** in the Gradio `Dropdown` component's pre-processing\
  \ step. Even if the `allow_custom_value` parameter is set to `False`, attackers can bypass\
  \ this restriction by sending custom requests with arbitrary values, effectively breaking\
  \ the developer’s intended input constraints. While this alone is not a severe vulnerability,\
  \ it can lead to more critical security issues, particularly when paired with other vulnerabilities\
  \ like file downloads from the user's machine.\n\n### Patches\nYes, this issue is addressed\
  \ in `gradio>=5.0`. Please upgrade to the latest version to resolve the problem.\n\n### Workarounds\
  \  \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\
  \nTo mitigate the issue without upgrading, developers can add manual validation in their prediction\
  \ function to check the received values against the allowed dropdown values before processing\
  \ them."
