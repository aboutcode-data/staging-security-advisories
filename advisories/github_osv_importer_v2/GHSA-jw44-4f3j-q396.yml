  Withdrawn Advisory: Helm shows secrets in clear text
  ### Withdrawn Advisory

  This advisory has been withdrawn because the issue describes intended behavior and the output is not exposed to unauthorized users. This link has been maintained to preserve external references.

  ### Original Description

  An issue was discovered in Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Helm. It displays values of secrets when the --dry-run flag is used. This is a security concern in some use cases, such as a --dry-run call by a CI/CD tool. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior was introduced intentionally, and cannot be removed without breaking backwards compatibility (some users may be relying on these values).
