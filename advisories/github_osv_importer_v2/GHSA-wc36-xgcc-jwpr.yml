summary: "Failure to verify the public key of a `SignedEnvelope` against the `PeerId` in a `PeerRecord`\n\
  Affected versions of this crate did not check that the public key the signature was created\
  \ with matches the peer ID of the peer record. \nAny combination was considered valid.\n\n\
  This allows an attacker to republish an existing `PeerRecord` with a different `PeerId`."
