  - CVE-2023-49282
summary: "Test code in published microsoft-graph package exposes phpinfo()\n### Impact\n\nThe\
  \ Microsoft Graph PHP SDK published packages which contained test code that enabled the use\
  \ of the phpInfo() function from any application that could access and execute the file at\
  \ vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php.  The phpInfo function exposes system\
  \ information. \n\nThe vulnerability affects the GetPhpInfo.php script of the PHP SDK which\
  \ contains a call to the phpinfo() function.  \n\nThis vulnerability requires a misconfiguration\
  \ of the server to be present so it can be exploited. For example, making the PHP application’s\
  \ /vendor directory web accessible.  \n\nThe combination of the vulnerability and the server\
  \ misconfiguration would allow an attacker to craft an HTTP request that executes the phpinfo()\
  \ method. The attacker would then be able to get access to system information like configuration,\
  \ modules, and environment variables and later on use the compromised secrets to access additional\
  \ data.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been patched in versions 1.109.1 and 2.0.0-RC5.\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate deployment with the updated vendor package is not available,\
  \ you can perform the following temporary workarounds:\n- delete the vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php\
  \ file\n- remove access to the /vendor directory will remove this vulnerability\n- disable\
  \ the phpinfo function\n\n### References\nFor more information about the vulnerability and\
  \ the patch, users can refer to the following sources: \n\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49103\n\
