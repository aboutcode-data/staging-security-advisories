summary: "notation-go has an OS error when setting CRL cache leads to denial of signature verification\n\
  ### Summary\nThe issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate\
  \ Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.\nAfter retrieving the CRL, notation-go\
  \ attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may\
  \ fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination\
  \ paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination.\n\
  \n### Details\n\nIn method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated\
  \ area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move\
  \ it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation,\
  \ OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on `rename` syscall\
  \ from the libc and as per the [documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html),\
  \ moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an `EXDEV` error, interpreted as `Cross device\
  \ link not permitted error`.\nSome Linux distribution, like `RedHat` use a dedicated filesystem\
  \ (`tmpfs`), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually `/tmp`) for temporary files. When using\
  \ such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash `notation`. \n\n### PoC\n1.\
  \ Ensure that the temporary file storage area (e.g., /tmp) is mounted on a different mount\
  \ point than the user's 'notation' cache directory.\n2. Either disable the Online Certificate\
  \ Status Protocol (OCSP) revocation check, or utilize certificates that exclusively support\
  \ Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for revocation check.\n3. Try to verify a previously\
  \ generated signature using the 'notation' tool.\n\n### Impact\nThe signature verification\
  \ process is aborted as process crashes.\n\n### Remediation\nThe cache file should be created,\
  \ written, then copied to the wanted final location, and finally removed. Additionally, this\
  \ error shouldn't lead to a crash as it is not fatal and shouldn't prevent the rest of the\
  \ program to properly continue"
