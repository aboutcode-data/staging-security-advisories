aliases:
  - CVE-2016-10538
summary: |
  Arbitrary File Write in cli
  Affected versions of `cli` use predictable temporary file names. If an attacker can create a symbolic link at the location of one of these temporarly file names, the attacker can arbitrarily write to any file that the user which owns the `cli` process has permission to write to.


  ## Proof of Concept

  By creating Symbolic Links at the following locations, the target of the link can be written to.
  ```
  lock_file = '/tmp/' + cli.app + '.pid',
  log_file = '/tmp/' + cli.app + '.log';
  ```


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 1.0.0 or later.
