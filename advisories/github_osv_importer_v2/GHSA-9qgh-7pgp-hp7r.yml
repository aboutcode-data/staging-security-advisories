  Cross-Site Scripting in graylog-web-interface
  All versions of  `graylog-web-interface` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to escape output on the `TypeAhead` and `QueryInput` components, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the victim's browser.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
