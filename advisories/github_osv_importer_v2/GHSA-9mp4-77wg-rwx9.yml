summary: |
  @clerk/backend Performs Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
  ### Impact

  Applications that use the `verifyWebhook()` helper to verify incoming Clerk webhooks are susceptible to accepting improperly signed webhook events.

  ### Patches

  * `@clerk/backend`: the helper has been patched as of `2.4.0`
  * `@clerk/astro`: the helper has been patched as of `2.10.2`
  * `@clerk/express`: the helper has been patched as of `1.7.4`
  * `@clerk/fastify`: the helper has been patched as of `2.4.4`
  * `@clerk/nextjs`: the helper has been patched as of `6.23.3`
  * `@clerk/nuxt`: the helper has been patched as of `1.7.5`
  * `@clerk/react-router`: the helper has been patched as of `1.6.4`
  * `@clerk/remix`: the helper has been patched as of `4.8.5`
  * `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`: the helper has been patched as of `0.18.3`

  ### Resolution

  The issue was resolved in **`@clerk/backend` `2.4.0`** by:

  * Properly parsing the webhook request's signatures and comparing them against the signature generated from the received event

  ### Workarounds

  If unable to upgrade, developers can workaround this issue by verifying webhooks manually, per [this documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/webhooks/overview#protect-your-webhooks-from-abuse).
