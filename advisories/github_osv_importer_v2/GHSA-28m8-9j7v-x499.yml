summary: |
  Tauri's readDir Endpoint Scope can be Bypassed With Symbolic Links
  ### Impact
  Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked.


  ### Patches
  The issue has been resolved in https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123 and the implementation now properly checks if the
  requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`.

  ### Workarounds
  Disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.
