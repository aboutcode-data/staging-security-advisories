  Withdrawn Advisory: Axios has Transitive Critical Vulnerability via form-data
  ### Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because users of Axios 1.10.0 have the flexibility to use a patched version of form-data, the software in which the vulnerability originates, without upgrading Axios to address GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4.

  ### Original Description
  A critical vulnerability exists in the form-data package used by `axios@1.10.0`. The issue allows an attacker to predict multipart boundary values generated using `Math.random()`, opening the door to HTTP parameter pollution or injection attacks.

  This was submitted in [issue #6969](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6969) and addressed in [pull request #6970](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/6970).

  ### Details
  The vulnerable package `form-data@4.0.0` is used by `axios@1.10.0` as a transitive dependency. It uses non-secure, deterministic randomness (`Math.random()`) to generate multipart boundary strings.

  This flaw is tracked under [Snyk Advisory SNYK-JS-FORMDATA-10841150](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FORMDATA-10841150) and [CVE-2025-7783](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-FORMDATA-10841150).

  Affected `form-data` versions:
  - <2.5.4
  - >=3.0.0 <3.0.4
  - >=4.0.0 <4.0.4

  Since `axios@1.10.0` pulls in `form-data@4.0.0`, it is exposed to this issue.


  ### PoC
  1. Install Axios: - `npm install axios@1.10.0`
  2.Run `snyk test`:
  ```
  Tested 104 dependencies for known issues, found 1 issue, 1 vulnerable path.

  ✗ Predictable Value Range from Previous Values [Critical Severity]
  in form-data@4.0.0 via axios@1.10.0 > form-data@4.0.0

  ```
  3. Trigger a multipart/form-data request. Observe the boundary header uses predictable random values, which could be exploited in a targeted environment.


  ### Impact

  - **Vulnerability Type**: Predictable Value / HTTP Parameter Pollution
  - **Risk**: Critical (CVSS 9.4)
  - **Impacted Users**: Any application using axios@1.10.0 to submit multipart form-data


  This could potentially allow attackers to:
  - Interfere with multipart request parsing
  - Inject unintended parameters
  - Exploit backend deserialization logic depending on content boundaries
