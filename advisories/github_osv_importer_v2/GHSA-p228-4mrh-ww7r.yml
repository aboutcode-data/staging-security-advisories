summary: "Elrond-GO processing: fallback search of SCRs when not found in the main cache\n###\
  \ Impact\nProcessing issue, nodes are affected when trying to process a cross-shard relayed\
  \ transaction with a smart contract deploy transaction data. The problem was a bad correlation\
  \ between the transaction caches and the processing component. If the above-mentioned transaction\
  \ was sent with more gas than required, the smart contract result (SCR transaction) that should\
  \ have returned the leftover gas, would have been wrongly added to a cache that the processing\
  \ unit did not consider. The node stopped notarizing metachain blocks. The fix was actually\
  \ to extend the SCR transaction search in all other caches if it wasn't found in the correct\
  \ (expected) sharded-cache. \n\n### Patches\nAll versions >= v1.3.50 will contain this patch\n\
  \n### Workarounds\nFor the moment there is no workaround\n\n### References\nN/A\n\n### For\
  \ more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an\
  \ issue in [elrond-go main repo](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go)"
