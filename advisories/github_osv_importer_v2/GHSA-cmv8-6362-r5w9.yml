  - CVE-2022-29164
summary: "Malicious HTML+XHR Artifact Privilege Escalation in Argo Workflows\nArgo Workflows\
  \ is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes.\n\
  \n* The attacker creates a workflow that produces a HTML artifact that contains a HTML file\
  \ that contains a script which uses XHR calls to interact with the Argo Server API.\n* The\
  \ attacker emails the deep-link to the artifact to their victim. The victim opens the link,\
  \ the script starts running.\n\nAs the script has access to the Argo Server API (as the victim),\
  \ so may do the following (if the victim may):\n\n* Read information about the victim’s workflows.\n\
  * Create or delete workflows.\n\nNotes:\n\n* The attacker must be an insider: they must have\
  \ access to the same cluster as the victim and must already be able to run their own workflows.\
  \ \n* The attacker must have an understanding of the victim’s system. They won’t be able to\
  \ repeatedly probe due to the social engineering  aspect.\n* The attacker is likely leave\
  \ an audit trail.\n\nWe have seen no evidence of this in the wild. While the impact is high,\
  \ it is very hard to exploit. \n\nWe urge all users to upgrade to the fixed versions. Disabling\
  \ the Argo Server is the only known workaround. Note version 2.12 has been out of support\
  \ for sometime. No fix is currently planned."
