summary: |
  Client metadata path-traversal
  ### Impact
  In both clients (`tuf/client` and `tuf/ngclient`), there is a path traversal vulnerability that in the worst case can overwrite files ending in `.json` anywhere on the client system on a call to `get_one_valid_targetinfo()`. It occurs because the rolename is used to form the filename, and may contain path traversal characters (ie `../../name.json`).

  The impact is mitigated by a few facts:
  * It only affects implementations that allow arbitrary rolename selection for delegated targets metadata
  * The attack requires the ability to A) insert new metadata for the path-traversing role and B) get the role delegated by an existing targets metadata
  * The written file content is heavily restricted since it needs to be a valid, signed targets file. The file extension is always .json.

  ### Patches
  A fix is available in version 0.19 or newer.

  ### Workarounds
  None that do not require code changes. Clients can restrict the allowed character set for rolenames, or they can store metadata in files named in a way that is not vulnerable: neither of these approaches is possible without modifying python-tuf.
