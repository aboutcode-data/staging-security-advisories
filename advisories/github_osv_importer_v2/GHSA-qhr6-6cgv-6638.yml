summary: "Improper Memory Cleanup in the Okta Java SDK\n### Description\nIn the Okta Java SDK,\
  \ specific multithreaded implementations may encounter memory issues as threads are not properly\
  \ cleaned up after requests are completed. Over time, this can degrade performance and availability\
  \ in long-running applications and may result in a denial-of-service condition under sustained\
  \ load.\n\n### Affected product and versions\nYou may be affected by this vulnerability if\
  \ you meet the following preconditions:\n- Using the Okta Java SDK between versions 21.0.0\
  \ and 24.0.0, and\n- Implementing a long-running application using the ApiClient in a multi-threaded\
  \ manner.\n\n### Resolution\nUpgrade Okta/okta-sdk-java to versions 24.0.1 or greater. \n\n\
  ### Acknowledgement\nOkta would like to thank Andrew Pikler (pyckle) for their discovery and\
  \ responsible disclosure."
