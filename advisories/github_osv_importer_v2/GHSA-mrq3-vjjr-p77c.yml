summary: |
  Fastify Vulnerable to DoS via Unbounded Memory Allocation in sendWebStream
  ### Impact
  A Denial of Service vulnerability in Fastify’s Web Streams response handling can allow a remote client to exhaust server memory. Applications that return a `ReadableStream` (or `Response` with a Web Stream body) via `reply.send()` are impacted. A slow or non-reading client can trigger unbounded buffering when backpressure is ignored, leading to process crashes or severe degradation.

  ### Patches
  The issue is fixed in Fastify 5.7.3. Users should upgrade to 5.7.3 or later.

  ### Workarounds
  Avoid sending Web Streams from Fastify responses (e.g., `ReadableStream` or `Response` bodies). Use Node.js streams (`stream.Readable`) or buffered payloads instead until the project can upgrade.
