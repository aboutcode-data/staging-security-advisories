  Cross-Site Scripting in serve
  Versions of `serve` prior to 10.0.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package does not encode output, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser if user-supplied input is rendered.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 10.0.2 or later.
