  Withdrawn Advisory: LikeC4 has RCE through vulnerable React and Next.js versions
  ### Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because LikeC4 isn’t impacted by CVE-2025-55182 because it doesn’t ship React. React is a peer dependency.

  ### Original Description
  LikeC4 uses React and Next.js: which contain known RCE vulnerabilities, as seen in CVE-2025-55182.

  [2025-12-15] Edit: the last fixes published by React were not thorough, a new set of fix releases completes the mitigation; see https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/11/denial-of-service-and-source-code-exposure-in-react-server-components
