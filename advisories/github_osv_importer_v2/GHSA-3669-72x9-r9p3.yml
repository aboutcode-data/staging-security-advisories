summary: "Potential memory exhaustion attack due to sparse slice deserialization\n### Details\n\
  \nRunning `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of type `[]struct{...}` opens\
  \ it up to malicious attacks regarding memory allocations, taking advantage of the sparse\
  \ slice functionality. For instance, in the Proof of Concept written below, someone can specify\
  \ to set a field of the billionth element and it will allocate all other elements before it\
  \ in the slice. \n\nIn the local environment environment for my project, I was able to call\
  \ an endpoint like `/innocent_endpoint?arr.10000000.X=1` and freeze my system from the memory\
  \ allocation while parsing `r.Form`. I think [this line](https://github.com/gorilla/schema/blob/main/decoder.go#L223)\
  \ is responsible for allocating the slice, although I haven't tested to make sure, so it's\
  \ just an educated guess.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nThe following proof of concept works\
  \ on both v1.2.0 and v1.2.1. I have not tested earlier versions.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\n\
  import (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\n\t\"github.com/gorilla/schema\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tdec := schema.NewDecoder()\n\
  \tvar result struct {\n\t\tArr []struct{ Val int }\n\t}\n\tif err := dec.Decode(&result, map[string][]string{\"\
  arr.1000000000.Val\": {\"1\"}}); err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%#+v\\\
  n\", result)\n}\n\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nAny use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with\
  \ arrays of other structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. There\
  \ seems to be no possible solution that a developer using this library can do to disable this\
  \ behaviour without fixing it in this project, so all uses of Decode that fall under this\
  \ umbrella are affected. A fix that doesn't require a major change may also be harder to find,\
  \ since it could break compatibility with some other intended use-cases."
