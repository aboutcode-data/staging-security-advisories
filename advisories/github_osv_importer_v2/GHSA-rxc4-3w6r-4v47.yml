  - CVE-2025-48956
summary: |
  vllm API endpoints vulnerable to Denial of Service Attacks
  ### Summary
  A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can be triggered by sending a single HTTP GET request with an extremely large header to an HTTP endpoint. This results in server memory exhaustion, potentially leading to a crash or unresponsiveness. The attack does not require authentication, making it exploitable by any remote user.

  ### Details
  The vulnerability leverages the abuse of HTTP headers. By setting a header such as `X-Forwarded-For` to a very large value like `("A" * 5_800_000_000)`, the server's HTTP parser or application logic may attempt to load the entire request into memory, overwhelming system resources.

  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_
  Type of vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)

  ### Resolution
  Upgrade to a version of vLLM that includes appropriate HTTP limits by deafult, or use a proxy in front of vLLM which provides protection against this issue.
