  Prototype Pollution in node-forge debug API.
  ### Impact
  The `forge.debug` API had a potential prototype pollution issue if called with untrusted input. The API was only used for internal debug purposes in a safe way and never documented or advertised.  It is suspected that uses of this API, if any exist, would likely not have used untrusted inputs in a vulnerable way.

  ### Patches
  The `forge.debug` API and related functions were removed in 1.0.0.

  ### Workarounds
  Don't use the `forge.debug` API directly or indirectly with untrusted input.
