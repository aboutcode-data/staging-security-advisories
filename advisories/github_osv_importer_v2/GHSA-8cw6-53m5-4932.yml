summary: |
  StudioCMS has Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
  ### Summary
  StudioCMS contains a Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerability in the Content Management feature that allows users with the "Visitor" role to access draft content created by Editor/Admin/Owner users.

  ### Details
  **The Issue:**
  The endpoint `/dashboard/content-management/edit?edit={UUID}` validates user authentication but does NOT validate:
  1. User role (should require Editor/Admin/Owner)
  2. Content ownership (should verify the draft belongs to the user)

  This allows users with "Visitor" role (lowest privilege) to access draft content created by Editor/Admin/Owner users by directly accessing the edit URL with the content UUID.

  ### PoC
     - **User A:** Editor role (example username: `dummy04`)
     - **User B:** Visitor role (example username: `dummy01`)

  **Reproduction Steps:**

  **Step 1 - Create draft as Editor:**

  1. Login as User A (Editor role)
  2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:4321/dashboard/content-management`
  3. Create new content (it will stay as draft)
  4. After saving, note the UUID in the URL:
  ````
     http://localhost:4321/dashboard/content-management/edit?edit=bad87630-69a4-4cd6-bcb2-6965839dc148
  ````
     Copy this UUID: `bad87630-69a4-4cd6-bcb2-6965839dc148`

  **Step 2 - Access draft as Visitor:**

  1. Login as Visitor and get auth_session cookie
  ```
  curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:4321/studiocms_api/auth/login" -F 'username=dummy01' -F 'password=dummy01pass$'
  ```

  2. Proof of Visitor permission

  3. Access Editor's draft using the UUID
  ```
  curl "http://127.0.0.1:4321/dashboard/content-management/edit?edit=bad87630-69a4-4cd6-bcb2-6965839dc148" -H "Cookie: auth_session=qvawh6zv23hc2spu6xx7pzgrnn4rpd3q" -v
  ```

  **Result:** Returns full HTML page with draft content (200 OK)

  ### Impact
  **Impact Scenarios:**

  1. **Information Disclosure:**
     - Visitor users can read unpublished drafts containing sensitive information
     - Drafts may contain confidential business information, unreleased announcements, or proprietary content
     - Competitive intelligence could be gathered from draft content

  2. **Privacy Violation:**
     - Personal notes, work-in-progress content, or internal communications in drafts exposed
     - Violation of content creator privacy expectations

  3. **Business Impact:**
     - Premature disclosure of marketing campaigns, product launches, or announcements
     - Loss of competitive advantage if draft strategies are exposed
     - Potential compliance issues if drafts contain regulated information

  4. **Complete RBAC Bypass:**
     - The entire role-based access control system for draft content is bypassed
     - "Visitor" role becomes equivalent to "Editor" for read access to drafts
     - Undermines the trust model of multi-user content management
