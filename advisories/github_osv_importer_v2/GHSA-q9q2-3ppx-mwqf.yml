summary: "Graylog Allows Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Files Plugin and API Browser\n### Impact\n\
  Two minor vulnerabilities were identified in the Graylog2 enterprise server, which can be\
  \ combined to carry out a stored cross-site scripting attack.\nAn attacker with the permission\
  \ `FILES_CREATE` can exploit these vulnerabilities to upload arbitrary Javascript code to\
  \ the Graylog2 server, which - upon requesting of the file by a user of the API browser -\
  \ results in the execution of this Javascript code in the context of the Graylog frontend\
  \ application. \nThis enables the attacker to carry out authenticated API requests with the\
  \ permissions of the logged-in user, thereby taking over the user session.\n\n### Patches\n\
  The generic API has been removed in 6.2.0 rendering the attack vector unreachable and additional\
  \ escaping has been added.\n\nAnalysis provided by Fabian Yamaguchi - Whirly Labs (Pty) Ltd"
