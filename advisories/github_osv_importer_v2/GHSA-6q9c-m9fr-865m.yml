  - CVE-2025-59163
summary: "vet MCP Server SSE Transport DNS Rebinding Vulnerability\nSafeDep `vet` is vulnerable\
  \ to a DNS rebinding attack due to lack of HTTP `Host` and `Origin` header validation. \n\n\
  To exploit this vulnerability following conditions must be met:\n\n1. A `vet` scan is executed\
  \ and reports are saved as `sqlite3` database\n2. A `vet` MCP server is running on default\
  \ port with SSE transport that has access to the report database\n3. The attacker lures the\
  \ victim to attacker controlled website\n4. Attacker leverages DNS rebinding to access `vet`\
  \ SSE server on `127.0.0.1` through the website\n5. Attacker uses MCP tools to read information\
  \ from report database\n\n### Impact\n\nData from `vet` scan sqlite3 database may be exposed\
  \ to remote attackers when `vet` is used as an MCP server in SSE mode with default ports through\
  \ the sqlite3 query MCP tool.\n\n### Patches\n\n* `v1.12.5` is released that patches the issue\
  \ with `Host` and `Origin` header allow list and validation\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Use `stdio`\
  \ (default) transport for SSE server"
