  - CVE-2024-23340
summary: |
  @hono/node-server cannot handle "double dots" in URL
  ### Impact

  Since v1.3.0, we use our own Request object. This is great, but the `url` behavior is unexpected.

  In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called "double dots", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path.

  ```ts
  const req = new Request('http://localhost/static/../foo.txt') // Web-standards
  console.log(req.url) // http://localhost/foo.txt
  ```

  However, the `url` in our Request does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned.

  ```ts
  const req = new Request('http://localhost/static/../foo.txt')
  console.log(req.url) // http://localhost/static/../foo.txt
  ```

  It will pass unresolved paths to the web application. This causes vulnerabilities like #123 when using `serveStatic`.

  Note: Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so it does not affect you if the user uses them. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them.

  ### Patches

  "v1.4.1" includes the change to fix this issue.

  ### Workarounds

  Don't use `serveStatic`.
