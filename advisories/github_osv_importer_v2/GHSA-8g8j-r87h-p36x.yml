summary: "Vitess users with backup storage access can gain unauthorized access to production\
  \ deployment environments\n### Impact\n\nAny user with read/write access to the backup storage\
  \ location (e.g. an S3 bucket) can manipulate backup manifest files so that arbitrary code\
  \ is later executed when that backup is restored. This can be used to provide that attacker\
  \ with unintended/unauthorized access to the production deployment environment — allowing\
  \ them to access information available in that environment as well as run any additional arbitrary\
  \ commands there.\n\n### Patches\nFixes are expected to be released with versions v23.0.3\
  \ and v22.0.4\nSee fix commit at https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commit/4c0173293907af9cb942a6683c465c3f1e9fdb5c\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nIf maintainers *intended* to use an external decompressor then they can\
  \ always specify that decompressor command in the `--external-decompressor` flag value for\
  \ `vttablet` and `vtbackup`. That then overrides any value specified in the manifest file.\n\
  \nIf maintainers did *not intend* to use an external decompressor, nor an internal one, then\
  \ they can specify a value such as `cat` or `tee` in the `--external-decompressor` flag value\
  \ for `vttablet` and `vtbackup` to ensure that a harmless command is always used. \n\n###\
