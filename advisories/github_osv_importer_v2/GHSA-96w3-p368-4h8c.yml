  - CVE-2020-35874
summary: |
  Use after free in internment
  ArcIntern::drop has a race condition where it can release memory which is about to get another user. The new user will get a reference to freed memory.

  This was fixed by serializing access to an interned object while it is being deallocated.

  Versions prior to 0.3.12 used stronger locking which avoided the problem.
