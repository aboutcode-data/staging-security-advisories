  Use after free in lru crate
  Lru crate has use after free vulnerability.

  Lru crate has two functions for getting an iterator. Both iterators give
  references to key and value. Calling specific functions, like pop(), will remove
  and free the value, and but it's still possible to access the reference of value
  which is already dropped causing use after free.
