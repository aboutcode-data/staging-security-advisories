  - CVE-2016-10580
summary: "Downloads Resources over HTTP in nodewebkit\nAffected versions of `nodewebkit` insecurely\
  \ download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker\
  \ has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace\
  \ the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `nodewebkit`.\n\
  \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available, and the package author has deprecated\
  \ this package. \n\nThe best path forward in mitigating this vulnerability is to use the [official\
  \ installer](https://www.npmjs.com/nw) instead of this package, as per the package author's\
  \ instructions."
