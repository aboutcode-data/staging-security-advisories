summary: |
  Directive injection when using dynamic overrides with user input
  ### Impact

  If user-supplied input was passed into `append/override_content_security_policy_directives`, a semicolon could be injected leading to directive injection.

  This could be used to e.g. override a `script-src` directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and the first one wins. The directives in `secure_headers` are sorted alphabetically so they pretty much all come before `script-src`. A previously undefined directive would receive a value even if `SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT` was supplied.

  The fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s.

  > Duplicate script-src directives detected.  All but the first instance will be ignored.

  See https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#parse-serialized-policy

  > Note: In this case, the user agent SHOULD notify developers that a duplicate directive was ignored. A console warning might be appropriate, for example.

  ### Patches

  Depending on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0.

  ### Workarounds

  If you are passing user input into the above methods, you could filter out the input:

  ```ruby
  override_content_security_policy_directives(:frame_src, [user_input.gsub(";", " ")])
  ```
