summary: "Remote Code Execution in Custom Integration Upload\n### Impact\nThe Fides webserver\
  \ API allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file must contain\
  \ YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept the inclusion of custom Python code\
  \ in it. The custom code is executed in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox\
  \ can be bypassed to execute any arbitrary code.\n\nThe vulnerability allows the execution\
  \ of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of the webserver python process\
  \ owner on the webserver container, which by default is `root`, and leverage that access to\
  \ attack underlying infrastructure and integrated systems.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Fides\
  \ versions `2.11.0` through `2.18.0`.\n\nExploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER`\
  \ authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged\
  \ users, specifically root users and users with the owner role. \n\nExploitation is only possible\
  \ if the security configuration parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by\
  \ the user deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by setting the\
  \ env var `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default this configuration\
  \ parameter is disabled.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version\
  \ `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems\
  \ against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure that `allow_custom_connector_functions`\
  \ in `fides.toml` and the `FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either\
  \ unset or explicit set to `False`."
