summary: "go-ethereum vulnerable to DoS via malicious p2p message\n### Impact\n\nA vulnerable\
  \ node can be made to consume very large amounts of memory when handling specially crafted\
  \ p2p messages sent from an attacker node.\n\nIn order to carry out the attack, the attacker\
  \ establishes a peer connections to the victim, and sends a malicious `GetBlockHeadersRequest`\
  \ message with a `count` of  `0`, using the `ETH` protocol. \n\nIn `descendants := chain.GetHeadersFrom(num+count-1,\
  \ count-1)`, the value of `count-1` is passed to the function `GetHeadersFrom(number, count\
  \ uint64)` as parameter `count`. Due to integer overflow, `UINT64_MAX` value is then passed\
  \ as the `count` argument to function `GetHeadersFrom(number, count uint64)`. This allows\
  \ an attacker to bypass `maxHeadersServe` and request all headers from the latest block back\
  \ to the genesis block. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix has been included in geth version `1.13.15`\
  \ and onwards. \n\nThe vulnerability was patched in: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29534\n\
  \n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds have been made public. \n\n### References\n\nNo more information\
  \ is released at this time.\n\n### Credit\n\nThis issue was disclosed responsibly by DongHan\
  \ Kim via the Ethereum bug bounty program. Thank you for your cooperation."
