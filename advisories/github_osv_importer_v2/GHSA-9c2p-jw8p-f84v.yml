  - CVE-2016-10556
summary: |
  SQL Injection in sequelize
  Affected versions of `sequelize` cast arrays to strings and fail to properly escape the resulting SQL statement, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.


  ## Proof of Concept
  In Postgres, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server there is an issue where arrays are treated as strings and improperly escaped.

  Example Query:
  ```
  database.query('SELECT * FROM TestTable WHERE Name IN (:names)', {
    replacements: {
      names: directCopyOfUserInput
    }
  });
  ```

  If the user inputs the value of `:names` as:
  ```
  ["test", "'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')"]
  ```

  The resulting SQL statement will be:
  ```sql
  SELECT Id FROM Table WHERE Name IN ('test', '\'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')
  ```
  As the backslash has no special meaning in PostgreSQL, MSSQL, or SQLite, the statement will delete the record in TestTable with an Id of 1.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to version 3.20.0 or later.
