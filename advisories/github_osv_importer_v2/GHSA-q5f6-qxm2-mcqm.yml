summary: "tarteaucitron.js has Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability\n\
  ## Summary\n\nA potential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was identified\
  \ in tarteaucitron.js in the handling of the `issuu_id` parameter. \n\n## Details\n\nThe issue\
  \ was caused by the use of insufficiently constrained regular expressions applied to attacker-controlled\
  \ input:\n\n    if (issuu_id.match(/\\d+\\/\\d+/)) {\n        issuu_embed = '#' + issuu_id;\n\
  \    } else if (issuu_id.match(/d=(.*)&u=(.*)/)) {\n        issuu_embed = '?' + issuu_id;\n\
  \    }\n\nThese expressions are not anchored and rely on greedy patterns (`.*`). When evaluated\
  \ against specially crafted input, they may cause excessive backtracking, leading to high\
  \ CPU consumption and potential denial of service.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker able to control\
  \ the `issuu_id` parameter could exploit this vulnerability to degrade performance or cause\
  \ temporary service unavailability through CPU exhaustion.\n\nNo confidentiality or integrity\
  \ impact was identified.\n\n## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/f0bbdac2fdf3cd24a325fc0928c0d34abf1b7b52\n\
  \nThe logic was simplified and hardened by removing ambiguous regular expressions and enforcing\
  \ strict input validation:\n\n    if (issuu_id.match(/^\\d+\\/\\d+$/)) {\n        issuu_embed\
  \ = '#' + issuu_id;\n    } else {\n        issuu_embed = '?' + issuu_id;\n    }\n\nThis change\
  \ eliminates the risk of catastrophic backtracking and prevents ReDoS conditions.\n\nAdditionally,\
  \ code related to the legacy \"Alexa Rank\" service was removed. This service, historically\
  \ provided by Alexa.com via browser toolbars and popularity rankings, has been deprecated\
  \ for several years and is no longer operational. The Alexa domain is now exclusively associated\
  \ with the Amazon voice assistant, and the original ranking service has been permanently discontinued."
