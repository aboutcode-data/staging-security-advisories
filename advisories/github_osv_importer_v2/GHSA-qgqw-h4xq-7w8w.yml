  - CVE-2026-24887
summary: "Claude Code has a Command Injection in find Command Bypasses User Approval Prompt\n\
  Due to an error in command parsing, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation\
  \ prompt to trigger execution of untrusted commands through the find command. Reliably exploiting\
  \ this required the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. \n\
  \nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing\
  \ manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nClaude Code thanks https://hackerone.com/alexbernier\
  \ for reporting this issue!"
