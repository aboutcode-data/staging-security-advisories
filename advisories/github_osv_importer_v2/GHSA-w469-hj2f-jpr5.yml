  \  Implementation of upload git LFS file api is vulnerable to arbitrary file write.  Due to\
  \ improper sanitization for upload path, a malicious authenticated user who has access to\
  \ Harness Gitness server api can use a crafted upload request to write arbitrary file to any\
  \ location on file system, may even compromise the server. \n\nUsers using git LFS are vulnerable.\n\
