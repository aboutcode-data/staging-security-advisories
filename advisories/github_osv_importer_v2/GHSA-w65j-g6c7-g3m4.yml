summary: "Multiple memory safety issues in actix-web\nAffected versions contain multiple memory\
  \ safety issues, such as:\n\n - Unsoundly coercing immutable references to mutable references\n\
  \ - Unsoundly extending lifetimes of strings\n - Adding the `Send` marker trait to objects\
  \ that cannot be safely sent between threads\n\nThis may result in a variety of memory corruption\
  \ scenarios, most likely use-after-free.\n \nA signficant refactoring effort has been conducted\
  \ to resolve these issues."
