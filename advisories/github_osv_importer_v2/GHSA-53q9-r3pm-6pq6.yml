  - CVE-2025-32434
summary: "PyTorch: `torch.load` with `weights_only=True` leads to remote code execution\n# Description\n\
  I found a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability in PyTorch. When loading model using\
  \ torch.load with weights_only=True, it can still achieve RCE.  \n\n# Background knowledge\n\
  https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security \n As you can see, the PyTorch official documentation\
  \ considers using `torch.load()` with `weights_only=True` to be safe.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdaa8520-d66a-473a-ab1f-163d793de298)\n\
  Since everyone knows that weights_only=False is unsafe, so they will use the  weights_only=True\
  \ to mitigate the seucirty issue.\nBut now, I just proved that even if you use weights_only=True,\
  \ it can still achieve RCE.\n\n# Credit\nThis vulnerability was found by Ji'an Zhou."
