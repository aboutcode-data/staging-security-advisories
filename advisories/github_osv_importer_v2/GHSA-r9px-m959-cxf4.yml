  - CVE-2025-21614
summary: "go-git clients vulnerable to DoS via maliciously crafted Git server replies\n### Impact\n\
  A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to `v5.13`.\
  \ This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing\
  \ specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in `go-git`\
  \ clients. \n\nThis is a `go-git` implementation issue and does not affect the upstream `git`\
  \ cli.\n\n### Patches\nUsers running versions of `go-git` from `v4` and above are recommended\
  \ to upgrade to `v5.13` in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn cases\
  \ where a bump to the latest version of `go-git` is not possible, we recommend limiting its\
  \ use to only trust-worthy Git servers.\n\n## Credit\nThanks to Ionut Lalu for responsibly\
  \ disclosing this vulnerability to us."
