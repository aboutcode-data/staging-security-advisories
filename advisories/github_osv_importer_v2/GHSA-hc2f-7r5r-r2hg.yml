summary: |
  Heap buffer overflow due to incorrect hash function in TensorFlow
  ### Impact
  The [`TensorKey` hash function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_key.h#L53-L64) used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`).  It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`.  This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer.  We couldn't use this byte vector anyways, since types like `tstring` include pointers, whereas we need to hash the string values themselves.

  ### Patches
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1b85a28d395dc91f4d22b5f9e1e9a22e92ccecd6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1b85a28d395dc91f4d22b5f9e1e9a22e92ccecd6).

  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, which is the only other affected version.
