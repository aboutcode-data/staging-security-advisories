summary: "AWS CDK EKS overly permissive trust policies\nIf you are using the `eks.Cluster` or\
  \ `eks.FargateCluster` construct we need you to take action. Other users are not affected\
  \ and can stop reading.\n\n### Impact \n\nThe AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) allows for the\
  \ definition of Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) clusters. `eks.Cluster`\
  \ and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles that have an overly permissive trust\
  \ policy. \n \nThe first, referred to as the _CreationRole_, is used by lambda handlers to\
  \ create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`, `HelmChart`,\
  \ ...) onto it. Users with CDK version higher or equal to  [1.62.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.62.0)\
  \ (including v2 users) will be affected.\n \nThe second, referred to as the _default MastersRole_,\
  \ is provisioned only if the `mastersRole` property isn't provided and has permissions to\
  \ execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster. Users with CDK version higher or equal to [1.57.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.57.0)\
  \ (including v2 users) will be affected.\n \nBoth these roles use the account root principal\
  \ in their trust policy, which allows any identity in the account with the appropriate `sts:AssumeRole\
  \ `permissions to assume it. For example, this can happen if another role in your account\
  \ has `sts:AssumeRole` permissions on `Resource: \"*\"`.\n\n#### CreationRole \n\nUsers with\
  \ CDK version higher or equal to [1.62.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.62.0)\
  \ (including v2 users). The role in question can be located in the IAM console. It will have\
  \ the following name pattern: \n\n```console \n*-ClusterCreationRole-* \n```\n\n#### MastersRole\
  \ \n\nUsers with CDK version higher or equal to [1.57.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.57.0)\
  \ (including v2 users) that are not specifying the `mastersRole` property. The role in question\
  \ can be located in the IAM console. It will have the following name pattern: \n\n```console\n\
  *-MastersRole-*\n```\n\n### Patches \n\nThe issue has been fixed in versions [v1.202.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v1.202.0),\
  \ [v2.80.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.80.0). We recommend you upgrade\
  \ to a fixed version as soon as possible. See [Managing Dependencies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/manage-dependencies.html)\
  \ in the CDK Developer Guide for instructions on how to do this.  \n \nThe new versions no\
  \ longer use the account root principal. Instead, they restrict the trust policy to the specific\
  \ roles of lambda handlers that need it. This introduces some breaking changes that might\
  \ require you to perform code changes. Refer to https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674\
  \ for a detailed discussion of options. \n\n### Workarounds \n\n#### CreationRole \n\nThere\
  \ is no workaround available for CreationRole. \n\n#### MastersRole \n\nTo avoid creating\
  \ the _default MastersRole_, use the `mastersRole` property to explicitly provide a role.\
  \ For example: \n\n```ts \nnew eks.Cluster(this, 'Cluster', { \n  ... \n  mastersRole: iam.Role.fromRoleArn(this,\
  \ 'Admin', 'arn:aws:iam::xxx:role/Admin') \n}); \n```\n\n### References\n\n[https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/25674)\n\
