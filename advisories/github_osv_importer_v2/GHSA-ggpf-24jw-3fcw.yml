  CVE-2025-24357 Malicious model remote code execution fix bypass with PyTorch < 2.6.0
  ## Description

  https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-rh4j-5rhw-hr54 reported a vulnerability where loading a malicious model could result in code execution on the vllm host. The fix applied to specify `weights_only=True` to calls to `torch.load()` did not solve the problem prior to PyTorch 2.6.0.

  PyTorch has issued a new CVE about this problem: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-53q9-r3pm-6pq6

  This means that versions of vLLM using PyTorch before 2.6.0 are vulnerable to this problem.
  ## Background Knowledge
  When users install VLLM according to the official manual
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d17e0bdb-26f2-46d6-adf6-0b17e5ddf5c7)

  But the version of PyTorch is specified in the requirements. txt file
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94aad622-ad6d-4741-b772-c342727c58c7)

  So by default when the user install VLLM, it will install the PyTorch with version 2.5.1

  In CVE-2025-24357, weights_only=True was used for patching, but we know this is not secure.
  Because we found that using Weights_only=True in pyTorch before 2.5.1 was unsafe

  Here, we use this interface to prove that it is not safe.

  ## Fix
  update PyTorch version to 2.6.0
