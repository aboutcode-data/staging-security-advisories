summary: |
  Apache Shiro has an Authentication Bypass
  ### Impact

  **Authentication Bypass:**
  A vulnerability exists in Apache Shiro that allows authentication bypass for static files when served from a case-insensitive filesystem (such as the default configuration on macOS or Windows).

  The issue arises when Shiro's URL filters are configured with lower-case rules (a common default), but the underlying operating system treats mixed-case filenames as identical. An attacker can access protected static resources by varying the capitalization of the filename in the request (e.g., requesting `/SECRET.TXT` to bypass a rule for `/secret.txt`).

  This issue specifically affects static file handling and does not impact dynamic resource paths that are case-sensitive.

  ### Patches
  Users should upgrade to Apache Shiro **2.1.0** or later.

  **Important Configuration Note:**
  Version 2.1.0 introduces a new configuration parameter to handle case-insensitivity, which must be enabled manually to resolve the issue:

  * **shiro.ini:**
      ```ini
      filterChainResolver.caseInsensitive = true
      ```
  * **Spring Boot (application.properties):**
      ```properties
      shiro.caseInsensitive=true
      ```

  *Note: Apache Shiro 3.0.0 (upcoming) will enable this setting by default.*

  ### Workarounds
  * Ensure that the filesystem hosting the application is case-sensitive (e.g., Linux/Unix).
  * Manually configure all Shiro filter chains to handle all possible case variations of protected filenames (not recommended due to complexity).
