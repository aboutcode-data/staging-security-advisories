aliases:
  - CVE-2026-26324
summary: |
  OpenClaw has a SSRF guard bypass via full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 (loopback / metadata reachable)
  ### Summary

  OpenClaw's SSRF protection could be bypassed using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals such as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` (which is `127.0.0.1`). This could allow requests that should be blocked (loopback / private network / link-local metadata) to pass the SSRF guard.

  - Vulnerable component: SSRF guard (`src/infra/net/ssrf.ts`)
  - Issue type: SSRF protection bypass

  ### Affected Packages / Versions

  - Package: `openclaw` (npm)
  - Vulnerable: `<= 2026.2.13`
  - Patched: `>= 2026.2.14` (planned next release)

  ### Details

  The SSRF guard's IP classification did not consistently detect private IPv4 addresses when they were embedded in IPv6 using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 notation. As a result, inputs like `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` could bypass loopback/private network blocking.

  ### Fix Commit(s)

  - `c0c0e0f9aecb913e738742f73e091f2f72d39a19`

  ### Release Process Note

  This advisory is kept in draft state with the patched version set to the planned next release. Once `openclaw@2026.2.14` is published to npm, the only remaining step should be to publish this advisory.

  Thanks @yueyueL for reporting.
