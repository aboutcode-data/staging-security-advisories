  - CVE-2024-41666
summary: "The Argo CD web terminal session does not handle the revocation of user permissions\
  \ properly\nArgo CD v2.11.3 and before, discovering that even if the user's ```p, role:myrole,\
  \ exec, create, */*, allow``` permissions are revoked, the user can still send any Websocket\
  \ message, which allows the user to view sensitive information. Even though they shouldn't\
  \ have such access.\n\n## Description\nArgo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows you to\
  \ get a shell inside a running pod, just like you would with kubectl exec. However, when the\
  \ administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user ```p, role:myrole,\
  \ exec, create, */*, allow```, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still\
  \ perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for\
  \ a long time. CVE-2023-40025 Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are\
  \ fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user ```p,\
  \ role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow``` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage\
  \ of sensitive information.\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released\
  \ in the following Argo CD versions:\n\nv2.11.7\nv2.10.16\nv2.9.21\n\n### For more information\n\
