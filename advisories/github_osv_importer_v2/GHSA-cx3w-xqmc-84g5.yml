aliases:
  - CVE-2021-21237
summary: |
  Git LFS can execute a Git binary from the current directory on Windows
  ### Impact
  On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat or git.exe file in the current directory, that program would be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems.

  This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955.

  This issue occurs because on Windows, [Go includes (and prefers) the current directory when the name of a command run does not contain a directory separator](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38736).

  ### Patches
  This version should be patched in v2.13.2, which will be released in coordination with this security advisory.

  ### Workarounds
  Other than avoiding untrusted repositories or using a different operating system, there is no workaround.

  ### References
  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_
