  Duplicate Advisory: `#[zeroize(drop)]` doesn't implement `Drop` for `enum`s
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory is a duplicate of [GHSA-c5hx-w945-j4pq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c5hx-w945-j4pq). This link is preserved to maintain external references.

  ## Original Description
  Affected versions of this crate did not implement `Drop` when `#[zeroize(drop)]` was used on an `enum`.

  This can result in memory not being zeroed out after dropping it, which is exactly what is intended when adding this attribute.

  The flaw was corrected in version 1.2 and `#[zeroize(drop)]` on `enum`s now properly implements `Drop`.
