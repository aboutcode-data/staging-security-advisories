aliases:
  - CVE-2025-55284
summary: "Claude Code's Permissive Default Allowlist Enables Unauthorized File Read and Network\
  \ Exfiltration in Claude Code\nDue to an overly broad allowlist of safe commands, it was possible\
  \ to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompts to read a file and then send file contents\
  \ over the network without user confirmation. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability\
  \ to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. \n\nUsers on standard Claude\
  \ Code auto-update received this fix automatically after release. Current users of Claude\
  \ Code are unaffected, as versions prior to 1.0.24 are deprecated and have been forced to\
  \ update.\n\nThank you to https://hackerone.com/wunderwuzzi23 for reporting this issue!"
