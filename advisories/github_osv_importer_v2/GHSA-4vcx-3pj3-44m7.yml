  - CVE-2025-64184
summary: "Dosage vulnerable to a Directory Traversal through crafted HTTP responses\n### Impact\n\
  \nWhen downloadinging comic images, Dosage constructs target file names from different aspects\
  \ of the remote comic (page URL, image URL, page content, etc.). While the basename is properly\
  \ stripped of directory-traversing characters, the file extension is taken from the HTTP `Content-Type`\
  \ header. This allows a remote attacker (or a Man-in-the-Middle, if the comic is served over\
  \ HTTP) to write arbitrary files outside the target directory (if additional conditions are\
  \ met). \n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in release 3.2. The [fix is small and self-contained](https://github.com/webcomics/dosage/commit/336a9684191604bc49eed7296b74bd582151181e),\
  \ so distributors might elect to backport the fix to older versions.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n\
  No"
