  - CVE-2024-32977
summary: |
  OctoPrint has an Authentication Bypass via X-Forwarded-For Header when autologinLocal is enabled
  ### Impact

  OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication **if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled** within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, by spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

  If autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact.

  ### Patches

  The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1.

  ### Workaround

  Until the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.

  ### PoC

  1. Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)
  2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite. Alternatively, there are browser extensions such as https://github.com/MisterPhilip/x-forwarded-for, but I haven't tried them.
  3. Navigate to OctoPrint and note that it logs you in automatically.
