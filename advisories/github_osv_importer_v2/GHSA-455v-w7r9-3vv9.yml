  - CVE-2025-58451
summary: |
  Cattown is Vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption through Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
  ### Overview
  A security review of the Cattown identified multiple weaknesses that could potentially impact its stability and security.

  ### Affected Versions
  - All versions below 1.0.2

  ### Description of Vulnerabilities
  1. CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
  The package used regular expressions with inefficient, potentially exponential worst-case complexity. This can cause excessive CPU usage due to excessive backtracking on crafted inputs, potentially leading to denial of service.
  2. CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Resource Exhaustion)
  The package was vulnerable to resource exhaustion, where processing malicious inputs could cause high CPU or memory usage, potentially leading to denial of service.

  ### Impact
  - Trigger excessive CPU consumption leading to denial of service
  - Cause resource exhaustion affecting service availability
  - Bypass protection mechanisms causing unexpected or insecure behavior

  ### Resolution
  These vulnerabilities have been fixed in version 1.0.2 of the Cattown. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version to mitigate the risks.

  ### Recommendations
  - Upgrade to Cattown version 1.0.2 or later as soon as possible.
  - Review and restrict input sources if untrusted inputs are processed.

  ### Acknowledgments
  The issues were proactively identified through CodeQL static analysis.
