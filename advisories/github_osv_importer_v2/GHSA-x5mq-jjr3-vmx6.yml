  - CVE-2025-24013
summary: |
  Missing validation of header name and value in codeigniter4/framework
  ### Impact
  Lack of proper header validation for its name and value. The potential attacker can construct deliberately malformed headers with `Header` class. This could disrupt application functionality, potentially causing errors or generating invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests might lead to a DoS scenario if a remote service’s web application firewall interprets them as malicious and blocks further communication with the application.

  ### Patches
  Upgrade to v4.5.8 or later.

  ### Workarounds
  Validate HTTP header keys and/or values if using user-supplied values before passing them to `Header` class.
