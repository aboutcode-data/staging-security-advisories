summary: |
  go-ipld-prime/codec/json may panic if asked to encode bytes
  `go-ipld-prime` is a series of Go interfaces for manipulating IPLD data and a Go module that contains the `go-ipld-prime/codec/json` codec.

  ### Impact

  Encoding data which contains a `Bytes` kind Node will pass a `Bytes` token to the JSON encoder which will panic as it doesn't expect to receive `Bytes` tokens. Such an encoding should be treated as an error, as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes.

  **This only impacts uses of the "json" codec, "dag-json" is not impacted.** Use of "json" as a decoder is not impacted.

  ### Patches

  Fixed in v0.19.0.

  ### Workarounds

  Prefer the "dag-json" codec which has the ability to [encode bytes](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/#bytes).

  ### References

  See fix in [#472](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/472)
