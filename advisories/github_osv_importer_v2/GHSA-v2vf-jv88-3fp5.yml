aliases:
  - CVE-2024-24764
summary: |
  October System module has an Open Redirect for Administrator Accounts
  ### Impact

  This advisory affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect outside the scope of the active host.

  This vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user.

  ### Patches

  This issue has been patched in v3.5.15.
