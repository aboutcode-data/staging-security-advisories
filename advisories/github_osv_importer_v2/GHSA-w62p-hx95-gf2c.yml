summary: "DuckDB NPM packages 1.3.3 and 1.29.2 briefly compromised with malware\nThe DuckDB\
  \ distribution for [Node.js](http://node.js/) on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) was compromised\
  \ with malware (along with [several other packages](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised)).\
  \ An attacker published new versions of four of duckdb’s packages that included **malicious\
  \ code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions**. The following packages and versions are\
  \ affected:\n\n- `@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3`\n- `@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3`\n- `duckdb@1.3.3`\n\
  - `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2`\n\n> Note: The current release version of DuckDB is 1.3.2,\
  \ with 1.4.0 expected to be released on Sept 10th, 2025 (tomorrow as of this writing). We\
  \ do not plan to ever release a “legit” DuckDB 1.3.3. Users should double-check that they\
  \ are not accidentally updating to those affected versions. \n\n\nWe have ourselves noticed\
  \ this *within four hours* of it happening. Here’s our response:\n\n- As an immediate response,\
  \ we have **deprecated** the specific versions. \n- We have reached out to npm support to\
  \ **delete the affected versions**. They were so kind to do so.\n- We have also **re-released**\
  \ the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0) as a further safeguard so the\
  \ latest version of the package points to a safe version\n\nWe apologize for this issue. We\
  \ are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases.\n\n### Postmortem\
  \ ###\n\nOn September 8th (Monday), the DuckDB maintainers received the following message\
  \ from \"...@npmjs.help\":\n\n<img width=\"1134\" height=\"614\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-09\
  \ at 11 07 09\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ce24798-1f5a-40b0-ac50-49035d99862b\"\
  \ />\n\nOne of the maintainers read through this text and found it somewhat reasonable. He\
  \ followed the link (now defunct) to a website hosted under the domain `npmjs.help`. This\
  \ website contained a **pixel-perfect copy** of the [npmjs.com](http://npmjs.com/) website.\
  \ He logged in using the `duckdb_admin` user and password, followed by 2FA. Again, the user\
  \ profile, settings etc. were a perfect copy of the [npmjs.com](http://npmjs.com/) website\
  \ including all user data. As requested by the email, he then re-set the 2FA setup. \n\nIn\
  \ the background, the copycat website forwarded all actions to the actual npm website, so\
  \ the 2FA was actually updated there, too. But they also added a new API token, which they\
  \ then used to publish the malicious package versions. In hindsight, the fact that his browser\
  \ did not auto-complete the login should have been a red flag. It's painful to spell out,\
  \ but **we fell for a classic phishing attack**.\n\nWe again apologize for this mishap. We\
  \ are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases. It is fortunate\
  \ that we noticed this within a few hours of it happening. The DuckDBLabs team was able to\
  \ set up a call at 7AM to perform an immediate response. Fortunately we were not locked out\
  \ of our NPM account, which also easily could have happened. We were able to rotate passwords,\
  \ tokens and API keys immediately."
