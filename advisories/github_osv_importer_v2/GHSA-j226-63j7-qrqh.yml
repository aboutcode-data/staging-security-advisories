summary: |
  Laravel Translation Manager Vulnerable to Stored Cross-site Scripting
  ### Impact
  The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript scripts, into the page processed by the user's browser, allowing them to steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or conduct other malicious activities.

  ### Patches
  The issue is fixed in https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-translation-manager/pull/475 which is released in version 0.6.8

  ### Workarounds
  Only authenticated users with access to the translation manager are impacted.
