summary: "CRLF vulnerability in Fiber\n### Impact\nThe filename that is given in [c.Attachment()](https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#attachment)\
  \ is not escaped, and therefore vulnerable for a CRLF injection attack. I.e. an attacker could\
  \ upload a custom filename and then give the link to the victim. With this filename, the attacker\
  \ can change the name of the downloaded file, redirect to another site, change the authorization\
  \ header, etc.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/gofiber/fiber\"\
  \n\nconst badFileName = \"another secret document.pdf\\\"\\r\\nLocation: google.com\\r\\nAuthorization:\
  \ \\\"example_of_session_fixation\"\n\nfunc splitTheResponse(c *fiber.Ctx) {\n\tc.Attachment(badFileName)\n\
  }\n\nfunc main() {\n\tapp := fiber.New()\n\tapp.Get(\"/attack\", splitTheResponse)\n\tapp.Listen(\"\
  127.0.0.1:8080\")\n}\n```\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 10 Jul 2020 19:47:04 GMT\nContent-Type:\
  \ application/octet-stream\nContent-Length: 0\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"\
  another secret document.pdf\"\nLocation: google.com\nAuthorization: \"example_of_session_fixation\"\
  \n```\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in `v1.12.6` with commit [579](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/579/commits/f698b5d5066cfe594102ae252cd58a1fe57cf56f)\
  \ escaping the filename by default.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou could of course serialize the\
  \ input yourself before passing it to `ctx.Attachment()`, this is actually a good practice\
  \ by default. But in case you forget, we got you covered \U0001F44D \n\n### References\nA\
  \ CRLF injection attack is one of several types of injection attacks. It can be used to escalate\
  \ to more malicious attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), page injection, web cache\
  \ poisoning, cache-based defacement, and more. A CRLF injection vulnerability exists if an\
  \ attacker can inject the CRLF characters into a web application, for example using a user\
  \ input form or an HTTP request, [see acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/crlf-injection/)\n\
