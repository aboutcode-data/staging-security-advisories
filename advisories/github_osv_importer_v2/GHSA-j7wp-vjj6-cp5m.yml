  Cross-Site Scripting in @progress/kendo-angular-editor
  Kendo UI for Angular Editor Component (npm package @progress/kendo-angular-editor) before version 1.2.3 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. When the Editor content contains potentially malicious scripts in element event handlers, they get executed.
  Adding the following content to the Editor value demonstrates the issue: `<img src="" onerror=alert(document.domain)>`.
