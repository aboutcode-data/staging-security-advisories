summary: |
  Exploitable inventory component chaining in PocketMine-MP
  ### Impact
  Specially crafted `InventoryTransactionPacket`s sent by malicious clients were able to exploit the behaviour of `InventoryTransaction->findResultItem()` and cause it to take an abnormally long time to execute (causing an apparent server freeze).

  The affected code is intended to compact conflicting `InventoryActions` which are in the same `InventoryTransaction` by flattening them into a single action. When multiple pathways to a result existed, the complexity of this flattening became exponential.

  The problem was fixed by bailing when ambiguities are detected.

  **At the time of writing, this exploit is being used in the wild by attackers to deny service to servers.**

  ### Patches
  Upgrade to 3.15.4 or newer.

  ### Workarounds
  No practical workarounds are possible, short of backporting the fix or implementing checks in a plugin listening to `DataPacketReceiveEvent`.
