summary: |
  Trix has a stored XSS vulnerability through its attachment attribute
  ### Impact
  The Trix editor, in versions prior to 2.1.16, is vulnerable to XSS attacks through attachment payloads.

  An attacker could inject malicious code into a data-trix-attachment attribute that, when rendered as HTML and clicked on, could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed.

  ### Patches
  Update Recommendation: Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.16 or later.

  ### Resources
  The XSS vulnerability was reported by HackerOne researcher [michaelcheers](https://hackerone.com/michaelcheers?type=user).
