summary: |
  Shopware has Improper Input Validation issue in newsletter subscription
  ### Impact

  The newsletter double opt-in validation was not checked properly, and it was possible to skip the complete double opt in process.

  ### Patches
  The problem has been fixed with 6.4.18.1

  ### Workarounds
  For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version. Or disable the newsletter registration completely.
