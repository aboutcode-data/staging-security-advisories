summary: |
  @fastify/middie has Improper Path Normalization when Using Path-Scoped Middleware
  ## Summary
  A path normalization inconsistency in `@fastify/middie` can result in authentication/authorization bypass when using path-scoped middleware (for example, `app.use('/secret', auth)`).

  When Fastify router normalization options are enabled (such as `ignoreDuplicateSlashes`, `useSemicolonDelimiter`, and related trailing-slash behavior), crafted request paths may bypass middleware checks while still being routed to protected handlers.

  ## Impact
  An unauthenticated remote attacker can access endpoints intended to be protected by middleware-based auth/authorization controls by sending specially crafted URL paths (for example, `//secret` or `/secret;foo=bar`), depending on router option configuration.

  This may lead to unauthorized access to protected functionality and data exposure.

  ## Affected versions
  - Confirmed affected: `@fastify/middie@9.1.0`
  - All versions prior to the patch are affected.

  ## Patched versions
  - Fixed in: *9.2.0*

  ## Details
  The issue is caused by canonicalization drift between:
  1. `@fastify/middie` path matching for `app.use('/prefix', ...)`, and
  2. Fastify/find-my-way route lookup normalization.

  Because middleware and router did not always evaluate the same normalized path, auth middleware could be skipped while route resolution still succeeded.

  ## Workarounds
  Until patched version is deployed:
  - Avoid relying solely on path-scoped middie guards for auth/authorization.
  - Enforce auth at route-level handlers/hooks after router normalization.
  - Disable risky normalization combinations only if operationally feasible.
