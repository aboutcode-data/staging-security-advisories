  - CVE-2026-23737
summary: "seroval Affected by Remote Code Execution via JSON Deserialization\nImproper input\
  \ handling in the JSON deserialization component can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution.\n\
  \nThe vulnerability can be exploited via overriding constant value and error deserialization,\
  \ which allows indirect access to unsafe JS evaluation. This requires at least the ability\
  \ to perform 4 separate requests on the same function and partial knowledge of how the serialized\
  \ data is used during later runtime processing. \n\nThis vulnerability affects the `fromJSON`\
  \ and `fromCrossJSON` functions in a client-to-server transmission scenario.\n\nNo known workarounds\
  \ or mitigations are known, so please upgrade to the patched version."
