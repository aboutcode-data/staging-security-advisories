aliases:
  - CVE-2025-58059
summary: |
  Valtimo scripting engine can be used to gain access to sensitive data or resources
  ### Impact
  Any admin that can create or modify and execute process-definitions could gain access to sensitive data or resources.

  This includes but is not limited to:
  - Running executables on the application host
  - Inspecting and extracting data from the host environment or application properties
  - Spring beans (application context, database pooling)

  ### Attack requirements
  The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack:
  - The user must be logged in
  - The user must have the admin role (ROLE_ADMIN), which is required to change process definitions
  - The user must have some knowledge about running scripts via a the Camunda/Operator engine

  ### Patches
  Version 12.16.0 and 13.1.2 have been patched. It is strongly advised to upgrade.

  ### Workarounds
  If no scripting is needed in any of the processes, it could be possible to disable it altogether via the `ProcessEngineConfiguration`:
  ```
  @Component
  class NoScriptEnginePlugin : ProcessEnginePlugin {
      override fun preInit(processEngineConfiguration: ProcessEngineConfigurationImpl) {}

      override fun postInit(processEngineConfiguration: ProcessEngineConfigurationImpl) {
          processEngineConfiguration.scriptEngineResolver = null
      }

      override fun postProcessEngineBuild(processEngine: ProcessEngine) {}
  }
  ```
  Warning: this workaround could lead to unexpected side-effects. Please test thoroughly.
