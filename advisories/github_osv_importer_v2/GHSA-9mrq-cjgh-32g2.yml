summary: |
  smartbanner.js rel noopener vulnerability
  ## rel noopener vulnerability

  ### Impact
  Clicking on smartbanner _View_ link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile 3rd parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner.

  ### Patches
  `rel="noopener"` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability.

  ### Workarounds
  If you can not upgrade to `v1.14.1`:
  1. Ensure _View_ link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams
  2. If _View_ link is going to a 3rd party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel="noopener"` is imposed on all `target="_blank"` links.

      Following combination of smartbanner meta tags can be used to achieve the above:

      ```html
      <meta name="smartbanner:enabled-platforms" content="none">
      <meta name="smartbanner:include-user-agent-regex" content="Mobile.*Safari">
      ```
