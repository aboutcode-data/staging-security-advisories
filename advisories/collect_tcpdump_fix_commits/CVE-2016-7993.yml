  d07e352f5a8a9cbf7e8f3ed49a316ed906353fd8:CVE-2016-7993/Clean up relative time stamp printing.

  Have separate routines for signed and unsigned relative time stamps.
  Have the routine for signed time stamps handle the case of -2^31, where
  you can't negate it and have the result fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

  There are currently no users of the signed relative time stamp routine,
  but it's there in case anybody needs it (and is passing 32-bit
  quantitites, so that there's a risk that a packet might contain -2^31 as
  the time stamp).

  Fixes an array overflow found with American Fuzzy Lop by Hanno Böck.
