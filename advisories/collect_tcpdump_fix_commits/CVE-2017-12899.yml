  f96003b21e2abfbba59b926b10a7f9bc7d11e36c:CVE-2017-12899/DECnet: Add another test.

  This is from Brian Carpenter for the print-decnet bug fix.
  c6e0531b5def26ecf912e8de6ade86cbdaed3751:CVE-2017-12899/DECnet: Fix bounds checking.

  If we're skipping over padding before the *real* flags, check whether
  the real flags are in the captured data before fetching it.  This fixes
  a buffer over-read discovered by Kamil Frankowicz.

  Note one place where we don't need to do bounds checking as it's already
  been done.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
