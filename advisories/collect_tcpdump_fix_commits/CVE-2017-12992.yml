  e942fb84fbe3a73a98a00d2a279425872b5fb9d2:CVE-2017-12992/RIPng: Clean up bounds checking.

  Do bounds checking as we access items.

  Scan the list of netinfo6 entries based on the supplied packet length,
  without taking the captured length into account; let the aforementioned
  bounds checking handle that.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Kamil Frankowicz.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
