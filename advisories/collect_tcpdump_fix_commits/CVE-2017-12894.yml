  730fc35968c5433b9e2a829779057f4f9495dc51:CVE-2017-12894/In lookup_bytestring(), take the length of the byte string into account.

  Otherwise, if, in our search of the hash table, we come across a byte
  string that's shorter than the string we're looking for, we'll search
  past the end of the string in the hash table.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Forcepoint's security
  researchers Otto Airamo & Antti Levomäki.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
