  cc4a7391c616be7a64ed65742ef9ed3f106eb165:CVE-2017-13006/L2TP: Check whether an AVP's content exceeds the AVP length.

  It's not good enough to check whether all the data specified by the AVP
  length was captured - you also have to check whether that length is
  large enough for all the required data in the AVP.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Yannick Formaggio.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
