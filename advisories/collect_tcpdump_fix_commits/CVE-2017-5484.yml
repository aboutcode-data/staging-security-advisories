  5d214e36eed3565fbdc0f9b527bbc33a6bb63972:CVE-2017-5484/ATM: fix an incorrect bounds check

  The function sig_print() did receive a correct caplen parameter value
  but didn't use it correctly and could overread by one byte as Brian
  Carpenter has demonstrated. Fix it by switching to the standard macros.
