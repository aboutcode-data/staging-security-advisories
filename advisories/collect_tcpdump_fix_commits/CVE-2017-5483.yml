  eec1624f7be88008f519d92150ee0eb85633518b:CVE-2017-5483/SNMP: improve ASN.1 bounds checks

  Kamil Frankowicz had found that truncated BE_STR and BE_SEQ ASN.1
  elements could lead to an overread, from the source code it looked like
  other ids could have this problem too. Move the checks introduced in
  commit 72e501f out of the switch blocks to cover all ids by default.
  This fixes GH#559 and GH#566.
