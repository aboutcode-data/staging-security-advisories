  7bf069c2517690262aacbddc437731af991b31a7:CVE-2016-7983,7984/Don't use strchr() to scan packet data.

  It can't be told to stop at the end of the packet data.  Add a
  fn_printztn() that prints null-terminated strings, with a length check,
  and which returns the number of bytes processed, or 0 if we ran out of
  data.  That means it does the scanning we need, but safely.

  Use it in the TFTP and BOOTP printers.

  Fixes a heap overflow found with American Fuzzy Lop by Hanno Böck.
