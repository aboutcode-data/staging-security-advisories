  2d58b9bc9ef258d4142df5e56803ee1f317b5ce2:CHANGES: update item for CVE-2018-16301. [skip ci]

  It was misdescribed at some point; the fix was in tcpdump, not libpcap.
  88550c4dd64a36d10610bbd1e631204568186ff0:Do not list CVE-2018-16301 twice in CHANGES. [skip ci]

  Remove the earlier incorrect entry: at the time of tcpdump release 4.9.3
  the problem was not fixed, and it was not related to libpcap.
  ad7c25bc0decf96dc7768c9e903734d38528b1bd:Add CVE-2018-16301 to CHANGES. [skip ci]

  One of the effects of commit faf8fb7 was fixing a buffer overflow that
  was discovered and reported by Include Security (case reference "F2").
  Their work was sponsored by Mozilla under the Secure Open Source
  program.  The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2018-16301 on 2018-09-01
  (MITRE request reference "scr562827"), but was not properly documented
  afterwards.  Add a line to the change log section for 4.99.0, which at
  the time of this writing is the first release to incorporate the fix.
