  571a6f33f47e7a2394fa08f925e534135c29cf1e:CVE-2017-13035/Properly handle IS-IS IDs shorter than a system ID (MAC address).

  Some of them are variable-length, with a field giving the total length,
  and therefore they can be shorter than 6 octets.  If one is, don't run
  past the end.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture file won't be rejected as an invalid capture.
