  6f5ba2b651cd9d4b7fa8ee5c4f94460645877c45:CVE-2017-12893/SMB/CIFS: Add a bounds check in name_len().

  After we advance the pointer by the length value in the buffer, make
  sure it points to something in the captured data.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Forcepoint's security
  researchers Otto Airamo & Antti Levomäki.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
