  8509ef02eceb2bbb479cea10fe4a7ec6395f1a8b:CVE-2017-13012/ICMP: Add a missing bounds check.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture file won't be rejected as an invalid capture.
