  5dc1860d8267b1e0cb78c9ffa2a40bea2fdb3ddc:CVE-2017-13030/PIM: Redo bounds checks and add length checks.

  Use ND_TCHECK macros to do bounds checking, and add length checks before
  the bounds checks.

  Add a bounds check that the review process found was missing.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture file won't be rejected as an invalid capture.

  Update one test output file to reflect the changes.
