  e0a5a02b0fc1900a69d6c37ed0aab36fb8494e6d:CVE-2017-13039/IKEv1: Do more bounds checking.

  Have ikev1_attrmap_print() and ikev1_attr_print() do full bounds
  checking, and return null on a bounds overflow.  Have their callers
  check for a null return.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture file won't be rejected as an invalid capture.
