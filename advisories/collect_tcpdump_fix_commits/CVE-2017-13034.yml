  da6f1a677bfa4476abaeaf9b1afe1c4390f51b41:CVE-2017-13034/PGM: Add a bounds check.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture file won't be rejected as an invalid capture.

  Move a return to make the code a bit cleaner (i.e., make it more obvious
  that if we don't have enough of the PGM header, we just print the source
  and destination IP addresses, mark it as incomplete PGM, and don't try
  to look at the PGM header).
