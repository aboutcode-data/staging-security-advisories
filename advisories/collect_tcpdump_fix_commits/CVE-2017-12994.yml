  ffde45acf3348f8353fb4064a1b21683ee6b5ddf:CVE-2017-12994/BGP: Move a test inside a loop.

  The loop can be executed more than once (that's kinda the whole point of
  a loop), so the check has to be made each time through the loop, not
  just once before the loop is executed.

  Do some additional length checks while we're at it.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Forcepoint's security
  researchers Otto Airamo & Antti Levomäki.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
