  aa0858100096a3490edf93034a80e66a4d61aad5:CVE-2017-13049/Rx: add a missing bounds check for Ubik

  One of the case blocks in ubik_print() didn't check bounds before
  fetching 32 bits of packet data and could overread past the captured
  packet data by that amount.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Henri Salo from Nixu
  Corporation.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
