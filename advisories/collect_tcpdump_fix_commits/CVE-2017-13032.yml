  1bc78d795cd5cad5525498658f414a11ea0a7e9c:CVE-2017-13032/RADIUS: Check whether a byte exists before testing its value.

  Reverse the test in a for loop to test the length before testing whether
  we have a null byte.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture file won't be rejected as an invalid capture.

  Clean up other length tests while we're at it.
