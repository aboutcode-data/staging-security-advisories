  c24922e692a52121e853a84ead6b9337f4c08a94:(for 4.9.3) CVE-2018-14466/Rx: fix an over-read bug

  In rx_cache_insert() and rx_cache_find() properly read the serviceId
  field of the rx_header structure as a 16-bit integer. When those
  functions tried to read 32 bits the extra 16 bits could be outside of
  the bounds checked in rx_print() for the rx_header structure, as
  serviceId is the last field in that structure.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
