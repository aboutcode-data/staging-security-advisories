summary: |
  64f6392084ec0768b8afc04612eac0a458bc5e0d:CVE-2016-7923/Don't assume the target hardware address is <= 6 octets long.

  It might not be, either because an unusual hardware type is using ARP or
  because a maliciously-constructed packet was sent.  Instead of comparing
  against a 6-octet string of zeros with memcmp(), check each octet of the
  address against 0.

  Fixes a heap overflow found with American Fuzzy Lop by Hanno Böck.
