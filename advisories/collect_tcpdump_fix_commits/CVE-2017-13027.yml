  a77ff09c46560bc895dea11dc9fe643486b056ac:CVE-2017-13027/LLDP: Fix a bounds check.

  The total length of the OID is the OID length plus the length of the OID
  length itself.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture file won't be rejected as an invalid capture.
