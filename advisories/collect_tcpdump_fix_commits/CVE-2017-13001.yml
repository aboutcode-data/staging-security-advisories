  7a923447fd49a069a0fd3b6c3547438ab5ee2123:CVE-2017-13001/NFS: Don't copy more data than is in the file handle.

  Also, put the buffer on the stack; no reason to make it static.  (65
  bytes isn't a lot.)

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Kamil Frankowicz.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
