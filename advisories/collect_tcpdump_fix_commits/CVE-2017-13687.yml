  a1eefe986065846b6c69dbc09afd9fa1a02c4a3d:CVE-2017-13687/CHDLC: Improve bounds and length checks.

  Prevent a possible buffer overread in chdlc_print() and replace the
  custom check in chdlc_if_print() with a standard check in chdlc_print()
  so that the latter certainly does not over-read even when reached via
  juniper_chdlc_print(). Add length checks.
