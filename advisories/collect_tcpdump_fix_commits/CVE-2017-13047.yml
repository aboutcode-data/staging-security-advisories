  331530a4076c69bbd2e3214db6ccbe834fb75640:CVE-2017-13047/ES-IS: put an existing bounds check right

  The bounds check in esis_print() tested one pointer at the beginning of
  a loop that incremented another, make the trivial fix. While at it, make
  the function print a standard marker when it detects truncated data and
  update some existing ES-IS tests respectively.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
