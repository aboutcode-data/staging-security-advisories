  4c3aee4bb0294c232d56b6d34e9eeb74f630fe8c:CVE-2017-13040/MPTCP: Clean up printing DSS suboption.

  Do the length checking inline; that means we print stuff up to the point
  at which we run out of option data.

  First check to make sure we have at least 4 bytes of option, so we have
  flags to check.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Kim Gwan Yeong.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
