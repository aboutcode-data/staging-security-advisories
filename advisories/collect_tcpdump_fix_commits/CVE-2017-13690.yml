  8dca25d26c7ca2caf6138267f6f17111212c156e:CVE-2017-13690/IKEv2: Fix some bounds checks.

  Use a pointer of the correct type in ND_TCHECK(), or use ND_TCHECK2()
  and provide the correct length.

  While we're at it, remove the blank line between some checks and the
  UNALIGNED_MEMCPY()s they protect.

  Also, note the places where we print the entire payload.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).
