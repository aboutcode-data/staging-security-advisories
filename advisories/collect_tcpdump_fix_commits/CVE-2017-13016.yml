  c177cb3800a9a68d79b2812f0ffcb9479abd6eb8:CVE-2017-13016/ES-IS: Fix printing of addresses in RD PDUs.

  Always print the SNPA, and flag it as such; only print it as a MAC
  address if it's 6 bytes long.

  Identify the NET as such.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Bhargava Shastry,
  SecT/TU Berlin.

  Add tests using the capture files supplied by the reporter(s), modified
  so the capture files won't be rejected as an invalid capture.
