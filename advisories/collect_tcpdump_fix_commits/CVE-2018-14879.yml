  7ade781cf7ea6f067a2cab0406c8309fd3339eb4:Fix -V to fail invalid input safely

  This change fixes CVE-2018-14879.

  get_next_file() did not check the return value of strlen() and
  underflowed an array index if the line read by fgets() from the file
  started with \0. This caused an out-of-bounds read and could cause a
  write. Add the missing check.

  This vulnerability was discovered by Brian Carpenter & Geeknik Labs.

  Cherry picked from 9ba91381954ad325ea4fd26b9c65a8bd9a2a85b6
  in 4.9 branch.
