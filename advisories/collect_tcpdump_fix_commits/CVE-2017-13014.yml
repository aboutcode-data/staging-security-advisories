  cc356512f512e7fa423b3674db4bb31dbe40ffec:CVE-2017-13014/White Board: Do more bounds checks.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Yannick Formaggio.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).

  While we're at it, print a truncation error if the packets are
  truncated, rather than just, in effect, ignoring the result of the
  routines that print particular packet types.
