  5edf405d7ed9fc92f4f43e8a3d44baa4c6387562:CVE-2017-13008/IEEE 802.11: Fix TIM bitmap copy to copy from p + offset.

  offset has already been advanced to point to the bitmap; we shouldn't
  add the amount to advance again.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Brian 'geeknik' Carpenter.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).

  While we're at it, remove some redundant tests - we've already checked,
  before the case statement, whether we have captured the entire
  information element and whether the entire information element is
  present in the on-the-wire packet; in the cases for particular IEs, we
  only need to make sure we don't go past the end of the IE.
