  db8c799f6dfc68765c9451fcbfca06e662f5bd5f:CVE-2017-13009/IPv6 mobility: Add a bounds check.

  This fixes a buffer over-read discovered by Brian 'geeknik' Carpenter.

  Add a test using the capture file supplied by the reporter(s).

  While we're at it:

  Add a comment giving the RFC for IPv6 mobility headers.

  Clean up some bounds checks to make it clearer what they're checking, by
  matching the subsequent EXTRACT_ calls or memcpy.

  For the binding update, if none of the flag bits are set, don't check
  the individual flag bits.
