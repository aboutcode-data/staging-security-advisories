  https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/10096 is the pull request to
  the master branch that has been merged for inclusion in the 7 Jan 2025
  release of Jenkins 2.492.

  The Apache MINA core library has reported CVE-2024-52046
  https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-76h9-2vwh-w278 , an issue for MINA
  users that use `ioBuffer.getObject()`. Jenkins is not affected by
  the issue, but software composition analysis tools will report it as
  a vulnerability and we'll spend time explaining that Jenkins is not
  vulnerable.

  Let's backport the change to the stable-2.479 line so that it can be
  part of Jenkins 2.479.3

  This is an exception to the policy that we only backport to an LTS after
  a change has been merged to the Jenkins weekly release. I think this
  exception should be approved so that we reduce the amount of time that the
  Jenkins security team must spend explaining that Jenkins is not vulnerable
  to this issue. It is simpler to include the updated library plugin than
  to spend time explaining why this is not an issue.

  (cherry picked from commit efae3ca4559e6dc526a37d99e5a9f51050259d5c)
