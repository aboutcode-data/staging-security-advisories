  b27192be13da3fb59f51185d9a1f944b3474b2fc:slirp: ip_reass: Fix use after free

  Using ip_deq after m_free might read pointers from an allocation reuse.

  This would be difficult to exploit, but that is still related with
  CVE-2019-14378 which generates fragmented IP packets that would trigger this
  issue and at least produce a DoS.
