  2ac95494534aca06ec40f81729783fdd65305042:stellaris_enet: block migration

  Incoming migration with stellaris_enet is unsafe.
  It's being reworked, but for now, simply block it
  since noone is using it anyway.
  Block outgoing migration for good measure.

  2e1198672759eda6e122ff38fcf6df06f27e0fe2:hw/net/stellaris_enet: Convert to vmstate

  Convert this device to use vmstate for its save/load, including
  providing a post_load function that sanitizes inbound data to
  avoid possible buffer overflows if it is malicious.

  The sanitizing fixes CVE-2013-4532 (though nobody should be
  relying on the security properties of most of the unmaintained
  ARM board models anyway, and migration doesn't actually
  work on this board due to issues in other device models).
