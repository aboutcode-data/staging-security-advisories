  aa29141d84d58171c2d219f0a4b599bd76fb2e37:Merge remote-tracking branch 'kraxel/CVE-2011-1751' into staging
  505597e4476a6bc219d0ec1362b760d71cb4fdca:Ignore pci unplug requests for unpluggable devices (CVE-2011-1751)

  This patch makes qemu ignore unplug requests from the guest for pci
  devices which are tagged as non-hotpluggable.  Trouble spot is the
  piix4 chipset with the ISA bridge.  Requests to unplug that one will
  make it go away together with all ISA bus devices, which are not
  prepared to be unplugged and thus don't cleanup, leaving active
  qemu timers behind in free'ed memory.
