  81b23ef82cd1be29ca3d69ab7e98b5b5e55926ce:xen: limit guest control of PCI command register

  Otherwise the guest can abuse that control to cause e.g. PCIe
  Unsupported Request responses (by disabling memory and/or I/O decoding
  and subsequently causing [CPU side] accesses to the respective address
  ranges), which (depending on system configuration) may be fatal to the
  host.

  This is CVE-2015-2756 / XSA-126.
