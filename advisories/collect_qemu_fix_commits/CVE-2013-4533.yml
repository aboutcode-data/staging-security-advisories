  eb55958e189aecc2c52b08e1aeb11715b668a5ab:pxa2xx: avoid buffer overrun on incoming migration

  CVE-2013-4533

  s->rx_level is read from the wire and used to determine how many bytes
  to subsequently read into s->rx_fifo[]. If s->rx_level exceeds the
  length of s->rx_fifo[] the buffer can be overrun with arbitrary data
  from the wire.

  Fix this by validating rx_level against the size of s->rx_fifo.
