  64c1a5443528ac09d8cd50f365d6a2fb8375b90c:meson: Enable -Wvla

  QEMU has historically used variable length arrays only very rarely.
  Variable length arrays are a potential security issue where an
  on-stack dynamic allocation isn't correctly size-checked, especially
  when the size comes from the guest.  (An example problem of this kind
  from the past is CVE-2021-3527).  Forbidding them entirely is a
  defensive measure against further bugs of this kind.

  Enable -Wvla to prevent any new uses from sneaking into the codebase.

  cabe58b0f8542d5c3dd1eca0b4def50bee1ffab4:tests/qtest/xlnx-versal-trng-test.c: Drop use of variable length array

  This test program is the last use of any variable length array in the
  codebase.  If we can get rid of all uses of VLAs we can make the
  compiler error on new additions.  This is a defensive measure against
  security bugs where an on-stack dynamic allocation isn't correctly
  size-checked (e.g.  CVE-2021-3527).

  In this case the test code didn't even want a variable-sized
  array, it was just accidentally using syntax that gave it one.
  (The array size for C has to be an actual constant expression,
  not just something that happens to be known to be constant...)

  Remove the VLA usage.

  2a6cb383e2ec7224d8631c3c0a324bff469c9c64:hw/net/fsl_etsec/rings.c: Avoid variable length array

  In fill_rx_bd() we create a variable length array of size
  etsec->rx_padding. In fact we know that this will never be
  larger than 64 bytes, because rx_padding is set in rx_init_frame()
  in a way that ensures it is only that large. Use a fixed sized
  array and assert that it is big enough.

  Since padd[] is now potentially rather larger than the actual
  padding required, adjust the memset() we do on it to match the
  size that we write with cpu_physical_memory_write(), rather than
  clearing the entire array.

  b02c2a85a6c8e5ecc1bfca1ef794b5897c9ebad3:hw/nvme: Use #define to avoid variable length array

  In nvme_map_sgl() we create an array segment[] whose size is the
  'const int SEG_CHUNK_SIZE'.  Since this is C, rather than C++, a
  "const int foo" is not a true constant, it's merely a variable with a
  constant value, and so semantically segment[] is a variable-length
  array.  Switch SEG_CHUNK_SIZE to a #define so that we can make the
  segment[] array truly fixed-size, in the sense that it doesn't
  trigger the -Wvla warning.
