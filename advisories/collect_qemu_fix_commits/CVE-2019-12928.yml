  4f24430821c568936aeda417bbb00e989a9e1984:doc: document that the monitor console is a privileged control interface

  A supposed exploit of QEMU was recently announced as CVE-2019-12928
  claiming that the monitor console was insecure because the "migrate"
  command enabled arbitrary command execution for a remote attacker.

  To be a security risk the user launching QEMU must have configured
  the monitor in a way that allows for other users to access it. The
  exploit report quoted use of the "tcp" character device backend for
  QMP.

  This would indeed allow any network user to connect to QEMU and
  execute arbitrary commands, however, this is not a flaw in QEMU.
  It is the normal expected behaviour of the monitor console and the
  commands it supports. Given a monitor connection, there are many
  ways to access host file system content besides the migrate command.

  The reality is that the monitor console (whether QMP or HMP) is
  considered a privileged interface to QEMU and as such must only
  be made available to trusted users. IOW, making it available with
  no authentication over TCP is simply a, very serious, user
  configuration error not a security flaw in QEMU itself.

  The one thing this bogus security report highlights though is that
  we have not clearly documented the security implications around the
  use of the monitor. Add a few paragraphs of text to the security
  docs explaining why the monitor is a privileged interface and making
  a recommendation to only use the UNIX socket character device backend.
