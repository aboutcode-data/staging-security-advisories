  1124696193a6247f24a69cc2547d7ad80098833c:openpic: avoid buffer overrun on incoming migration

  CVE-2013-4534

  opp->nb_cpus is read from the wire and used to determine how many
  IRQDest elements to read into opp->dst[]. If the value exceeds the
  length of opp->dst[], MAX_CPU, opp->dst[] can be overrun with arbitrary
  data from the wire.

  Fix this by failing migration if the value read from the wire exceeds
  MAX_CPU.
