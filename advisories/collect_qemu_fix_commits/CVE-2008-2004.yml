  38f3ef574b48afc507c6f636ae4393fd36bda072:raw: Prohibit dangerous writes for probed images

  If the user neglects to specify the image format, QEMU probes the
  image to guess it automatically, for convenience.

  Relying on format probing is insecure for raw images (CVE-2008-2004).
  If the guest writes a suitable header to the device, the next probe
  will recognize a format chosen by the guest.  A malicious guest can
  abuse this to gain access to host files, e.g. by crafting a QCOW2
  header with backing file /etc/shadow.

  Commit 1e72d3b (April 2008) provided -drive parameter format to let
  users disable probing.  Commit f965509 (March 2009) extended QCOW2 to
  optionally store the backing file format, to let users disable backing
  file probing.  QED has had a flag to suppress probing since the
  beginning (2010), set whenever a raw backing file is assigned.

  All of these additions that allow to avoid format probing have to be
  specified explicitly. The default still allows the attack.

  In order to fix this, commit 79368c8 (July 2010) put probed raw images
  in a restricted mode, in which they wouldn't be able to overwrite the
  first few bytes of the image so that they would identify as a different
  image. If a write to the first sector would write one of the signatures
  of another driver, qemu would instead zero out the first four bytes.
  This patch was later reverted in commit 8b33d9e (September 2010) because
  it didn't get the handling of unaligned qiov members right.

  Today's block layer that is based on coroutines and has qiov utility
  functions makes it much easier to get this functionality right, so this
  patch implements it.

  The other differences of this patch to the old one are that it doesn't
  silently write something different than the guest requested by zeroing
  out some bytes (it fails the request instead) and that it doesn't
  maintain a list of signatures in the raw driver (it calls the usual
  probe function instead).

  Note that this change doesn't introduce new breakage for false positive
  cases where the guest legitimately writes data into the first sector
  that matches the signatures of an image format (e.g. for nested virt):
  These cases were broken before, only the failure mode changes from
  corruption after the next restart (when the wrong format is probed) to
  failing the problematic write request.

  Also note that like in the original patch, the restrictions only apply
  if the image format has been guessed by probing. Explicitly specifying a
  format allows guests to write anything they like.

  79368c81bf8cf93864d7afc88b81b05d8f0a2c90:Make default invocation of block drivers safer (v3)

  CVE-2008-2004 described a vulnerability in QEMU whereas a malicious user could
  trick the block probing code into accessing arbitrary files in a guest.  To
  mitigate this, we added an explicit format parameter to -drive which disabling
  block probing.

  Fast forward to today, and the vast majority of users do not use this parameter.
  libvirt does not use this by default nor does virt-manager.

  Most users want block probing so we should try to make it safer.

  This patch adds some logic to the raw device which attempts to detect a write
  operation to the beginning of a raw device.  If the first 4 bytes happen to
  match an image file that has a backing file that we support, it scrubs the
  signature to all zeros.  If a user specifies an explicit format parameter, this
  behavior is disabled.

  I contend that while a legitimate guest could write such a signature to the
  header, we would behave incorrectly anyway upon the next invocation of QEMU.
  This simply changes the incorrect behavior to not involve a security
  vulnerability.

  I've tested this pretty extensively both in the positive and negative case.  I'm
  not 100% confident in the block layer's ability to deal with zero sized writes
  particularly with respect to the aio functions so some additional eyes would be
  appreciated.

  Even in the case of a single sector write, we have to make sure to invoked the
  completion from a bottom half so just removing the zero sized write is not an
  option.

  1e72d3b7ad9108fec5cb90d38ddfd00bdf498db2:add format= to drive options (CVE-2008-2004)

  It is possible for a guest with a raw formatted disk image to write a
  header to that disk image describing another format (such as qcow2).
  Stopping and subsequent restart of the guest will cause qemu to detect
  that format, and could allow the guest to read any host file if qemu is
  sufficiently privileged (typical in virt environments).

  The patch defaults to existing behaviour (probing based on file contents),
  so it still requires the mgmt app (e.g. libvirt xml) to pass a new
  "format=raw" parameter for raw disk images.

  Originally noted by Avi Kivity, patch from Chris Wright.
