  554f802da3f8b09b16b9a84ad5847b2eb0e9ad2b:hw/pcie: better hotplug/hotunplug support

  The current code is broken: it does surprise removal which crashes guests.

  Reimplemented the steps:
   - Hotplug triggers both 'present detect change' and
     'attention button pressed'.

   - Hotunplug starts by triggering 'attention button pressed',
     then waits for the OS to power off the device and only
     then detaches it.

  Fixes CVE-2014-3471.
