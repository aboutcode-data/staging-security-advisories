  1ba1f2e319afdcb485963cd3f426fdffd1b725f2:virtio-blk: refuse SG_IO requests with scsi=off

  QEMU does have a "scsi" option (to be used like -device
  virtio-blk-pci,drive=foo,scsi=off).  However, it only
  masks the feature bit, and does not reject the command
  if a malicious guest disregards the feature bits and
  issues a request.

  Without this patch, using scsi=off does not protect you
  from CVE-2011-4127.
