  2265c71b3548913becbd1f6427e715dbbe3b0d2e:ssd0323: fix buffer overun on invalid state load

  CVE-2013-4538

  s->cmd_len used as index in ssd0323_transfer() to store 32-bit field.
  Possible this field might then be supplied by guest to overwrite a
  return addr somewhere. Same for row/col fields, which are indicies into
  framebuffer array.

  To fix validate after load.

  Additionally, validate that the row/col_start/end are within bounds;
  otherwise the guest can provoke an overrun by either setting the _end
  field so large that the row++ increments just walk off the end of the
  array, or by setting the _start value to something bogus and then
  letting the "we hit end of row" logic reset row to row_start.

  For completeness, validate mode as well.
