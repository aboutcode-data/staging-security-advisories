  e586edcb410543768ef009eaa22a2d9dd4a53846:virtiofs: drop remapped security.capability xattr as needed

  On Linux, the 'security.capability' xattr holds a set of
  capabilities that can change when an executable is run, giving
  a limited form of privilege escalation to those programs that
  the writer of the file deemed worthy.

  Any write causes the 'security.capability' xattr to be dropped,
  stopping anyone from gaining privilege by modifying a blessed
  file.

  Fuse relies on the daemon to do this dropping, and in turn the
  daemon relies on the host kernel to drop the xattr for it.  However,
  with the addition of -o xattrmap, the xattr that the guest
  stores its capabilities in is now not the same as the one that
  the host kernel automatically clears.

  Where the mapping changes 'security.capability', explicitly clear
  the remapped name to preserve the same behaviour.

  This bug is assigned CVE-2021-20263.
