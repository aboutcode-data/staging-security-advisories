  7e62255a4b3e0e2ab84a3ec7398640e8ed58620a:ccid: Fix buffer overrun in handling of VSC_ATR message

  ATR size exceeding the limit is diagnosed, but then we merrily use it
  anyway, overrunning card->atr[].

  The message is read from a character device.  Obvious security
  implications unless the other end of the character device is trusted.

  Spotted by Coverity.  CVE-2011-4111.
