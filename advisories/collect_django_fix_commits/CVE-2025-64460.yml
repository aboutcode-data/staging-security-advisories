  4d2b8803bebcdefd2b76e9e8fc528d5fddea93f0:[4.2.x] Fixed CVE-2025-64460 -- Corrected quadratic inner text accumulation in XML serializer.

  Previously, `getInnerText()` recursively used `list.extend()` on strings,
  which added each character from child nodes as a separate list element.
  On deeply nested XML content, this caused the overall deserialization
  work to grow quadratically with input size, potentially allowing
  disproportionate CPU consumption for crafted XML.

  The fix separates collection of inner texts from joining them, so that
  each subtree is joined only once, reducing the complexity to linear in
  the size of the input. These changes also include a mitigation for a
  xml.dom.minidom performance issue.

  Thanks Seokchan Yoon (https://ch4n3.kr/) for report.
