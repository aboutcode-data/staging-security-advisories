  097758baf32bf5f76b7bccc4638e2370dc46fe51:Upgrade to SnakeYAML 2.0

  This commit raises the SnakeYAML baseline version to 2.0.
  While most Spring applications are not affected by CVE-2022-1471,
  upgrading this version should prevent automated tools from raising this
  as a security issue. Such tools usually do not understand that YAML
  parsing in Spring is about reading configuration, not parsing untrusted
  content.

  Closes gh-30048
