summary: Testing using the Codenomicon HTTP Test Tool performed by the Apache Software Foundation
  security group and Red Hat uncovered an input validation issue in the IPv6 URI parsing routines
  in the apr-util library. If a remote attacker sent a request including a carefully crafted
  URI, an httpd child process could be made to crash. One some BSD systems it is believed this
  flaw may be able to lead to remote code execution.
