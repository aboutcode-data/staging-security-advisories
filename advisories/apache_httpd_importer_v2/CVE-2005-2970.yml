aliases: []
summary: A memory leak in the worker MPM would allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (memory consumption) via aborted connections, which prevents the memory for the transaction
  pool from being reused for other connections. This issue was downgraded in severity to low
  (from moderate) as sucessful exploitation of the race condition would be difficult.
