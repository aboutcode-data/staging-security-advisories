aliases: []
summary: A denial of service flaw was found in the mod_deflate module. This module continued
  to compress large files until compression was complete, even if the network connection that
  requested the content was closed before compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate
  to consume large amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file.
