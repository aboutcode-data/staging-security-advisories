summary: A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page.
  An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page
  of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled
  but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken
  this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note
  however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent
  cross-site scripting attacks.
