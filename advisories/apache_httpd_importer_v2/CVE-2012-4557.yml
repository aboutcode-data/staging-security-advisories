summary: A flaw was found when mod_proxy_ajp connects to a backend server that takes too long
  to respond. Given a specific configuration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,
  putting a backend server into an error state until the retry timeout expired. This could lead
  to a temporary denial of service.
