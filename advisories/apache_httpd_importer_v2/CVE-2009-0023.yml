summary: A heap-based underwrite flaw was found in the way the bundled copy of the APR-util
  library created compiled forms of particular search patterns. An attacker could formulate
  a specially-crafted search keyword, that would overwrite arbitrary heap memory locations when
  processed by the pattern preparation engine.
