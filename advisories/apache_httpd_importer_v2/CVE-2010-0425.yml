aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found with within mod_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll
  when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state
  and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod_isapi, a remote attacker could send
  a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would
  result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.
