aliases: []
summary: A flaw in the mod_ssl handling of the "SSLVerifyClient" directive. This flaw would
  occur if a virtual host has been configured using "SSLVerifyClient optional" and further a
  directive "SSLVerifyClient required" is set for a specific location. For servers configured
  in this fashion, an attacker may be able to access resources that should otherwise be protected,
  by not supplying a client certificate when connecting.
