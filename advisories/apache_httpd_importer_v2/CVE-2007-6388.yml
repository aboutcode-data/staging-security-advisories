aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the mod_status module. On sites where mod_status is enabled and
  the status pages were publicly accessible, a cross-site scripting attack is possible. Note
  that the server-status page is not enabled by default and it is best practice to not make
  this publicly available.
