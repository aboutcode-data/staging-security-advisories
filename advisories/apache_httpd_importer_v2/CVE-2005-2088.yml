aliases: []
summary: 'A flaw occured when using the Apache server as a HTTP proxy. A remote attacker could
  send a HTTP request with both a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and a Content-Length header,
  causing Apache to incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request in a way that causes
  the receiving server to process it as a separate HTTP request. This could allow the bypass
  of web application firewall protection or lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.'
