aliases: []
summary: Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie
  using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC
  by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable
  to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now
  added to prevent such attacks.
