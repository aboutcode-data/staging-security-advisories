aliases: []
summary: mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language
  header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If
  the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used
  to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated
  to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL
  byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely,
  the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely
  case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.
