aliases: []
summary: An off-by-one overflow flaw was found in the way the bundled copy of the APR-util library
  processed a variable list of arguments. An attacker could provide a specially-crafted string
  as input for the formatted output conversion routine, which could, on big-endian platforms,
  potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or a denial of service.
