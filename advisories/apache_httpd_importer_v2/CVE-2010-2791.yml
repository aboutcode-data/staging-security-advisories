summary: |
  An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_proxy_http in version 2.2.9 only, on Unix platforms. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced. The simplest workaround is to globally configure:
  SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
