summary: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read
  beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer.  While
  no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or
  lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected.
