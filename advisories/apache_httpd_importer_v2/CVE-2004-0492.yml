aliases: []
summary: A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod_proxy, which can be triggered
  by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order to exploit this issue an attacker
  would need to get an Apache installation that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious
  site. This would cause the Apache child processing the request to crash, although this does
  not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled
  by other Apache child processes. This issue may lead to remote arbitrary code execution on
  some BSD platforms.
