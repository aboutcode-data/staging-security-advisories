aliases: []
summary: mod_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using a AuthNonce
  secret. This could allow a malicious user who is able to sniff network traffic to conduct
  a replay attack against a website using Digest protection. Note that mod_digest implements
  an older version of the MD5 Digest Authentication specification which is known not to work
  with modern browsers. This issue does not affect mod_auth_digest.
