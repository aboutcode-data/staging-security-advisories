aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module. On sites where a reverse
  proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause
  the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is
  configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit
  a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded
  Multi-Processing Module.
