aliases: []
summary: A serious problem exists when a client sends a large number of headers with the same
  header name. Apache uses up memory faster than the amount of memory required to simply store
  the received data itself. That is, memory use increases faster and faster as more headers
  are received, rather than increasing at a constant rate. This makes a denial of service attack
  based on this method more effective than methods which cause Apache to use memory at a constant
  rate, since the attacker has to send less data.
