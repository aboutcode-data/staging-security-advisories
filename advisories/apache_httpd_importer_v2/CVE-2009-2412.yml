aliases: []
summary: A flaw in apr_palloc() in the bundled copy of APR could cause heap overflows in programs
  that try to apr_palloc() a user controlled size. The Apache HTTP Server itself does not pass
  unsanitized user-provided sizes to this function, so it could only be triggered through some
  other application which uses apr_palloc() in a vulnerable way.
