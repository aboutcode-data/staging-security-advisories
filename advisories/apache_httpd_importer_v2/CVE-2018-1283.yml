aliases: []
summary: When mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv
  on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header.
  This comes from the "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to
  CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header
  fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is
  not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the
  case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.
