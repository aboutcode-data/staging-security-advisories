summary: "It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient.\
  \  An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories\
  \ configured by Alias-like directives.  \n\nIf files outside of these directories are not\
  \ protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied\", these requests can\
  \ succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for\
  \ remote code execution.\n\nThis issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not\
  \ earlier versions."
