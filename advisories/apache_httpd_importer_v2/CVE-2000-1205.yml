summary: Apache was vulnerable to cross site scripting issues. It was shown that malicious HTML
  tags can be embedded in client web requests if the server or script handling the request does
  not carefully encode all information displayed to the user. Using these vulnerabilities attackers
  could, for example, obtain copies of your private cookies used to authenticate you to other
  sites.
