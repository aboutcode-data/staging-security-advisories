summary: A flaw was found when mod_proxy_ajp is used together with mod_proxy_balancer. Given
  a specific configuration, a remote attacker could send certain malformed HTTP requests, putting
  a backend server into an error state until the retry timeout expired. This could lead to a
  temporary denial of service.
