summary: An issue was discovered in the mod_ssl module in Apache 2.0.44-2.0.50 which could be
  triggered if the server is configured to allow proxying to a remote SSL server. A malicious
  remote SSL server could force an httpd child process to crash by sending a carefully crafted
  response header. This issue is not believed to allow execution of arbitrary code and will
  only result in a denial of service where a threaded process model is in use.
