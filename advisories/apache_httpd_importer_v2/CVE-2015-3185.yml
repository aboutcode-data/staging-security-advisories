aliases: []
summary: A design error in the "ap_some_auth_required" function renders the API unusuable in
  httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication
  but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require
  lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication
  is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this
  API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap_some_authn_required
  API added in 2.4.16 instead.
