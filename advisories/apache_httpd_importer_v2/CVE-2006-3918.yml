aliases: []
summary: A flaw in the handling of invalid Expect headers. If an attacker can influence the
  Expect header that a victim sends to a target site they could perform a cross-site scripting
  attack. It is known that some versions of Flash can set an arbitrary Expect header which can
  trigger this flaw. Not marked as a security issue for 2.0 or 2.2 as the cross-site scripting
  is only returned to the victim after the server times out a connection.
