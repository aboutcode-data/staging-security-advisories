aliases: []
summary: In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the
  'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually
  tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off"
  will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.
