aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the apr_brigade_split_line() function of the bundled APR-util library,
  used to process non-SSL requests. A remote attacker could send requests, carefully crafting
  the timing of individual bytes, which would slowly consume memory, potentially leading to
  a denial of service.
