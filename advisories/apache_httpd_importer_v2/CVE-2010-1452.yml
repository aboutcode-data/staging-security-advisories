aliases: []
summary: A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod_cache (2.2) and mod_dav (2.0 and
  2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd
  child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM.
  This issue is further mitigated as mod_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely
  to be authenticated, and mod_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers"
  directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.
