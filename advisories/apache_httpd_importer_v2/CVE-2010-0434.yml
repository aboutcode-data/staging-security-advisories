aliases: []
summary: A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy
  of the headers_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array
  as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod_headers
  which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in
  two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by
  leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which
  could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or
  in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.
