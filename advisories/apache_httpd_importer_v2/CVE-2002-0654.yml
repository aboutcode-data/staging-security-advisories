summary: A path-revealing exposure was present in multiview type map negotiation (such as the
  default error documents) where a module would report the full path of the typemapped .var
  file when multiple documents or no documents could be served. Additionally a path-revealing
  exposure in cgi/cgid when Apache fails to invoke a script. The modules would report "couldn't
  create child process /path-to-script/script.pl" revealing the full path of the script.
