summary: 'When HTTP/2 was enabled for a http: host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a https:
  host, an Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request on a connection
  could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. A server that never enabled the h2 protocol or
  that only enabled it for https: and did not configure the "H2Upgrade on" is unaffected by
  this.'
