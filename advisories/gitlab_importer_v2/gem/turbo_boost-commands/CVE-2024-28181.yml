summary: "TurboBoost Commands vulnerable to arbitrary method invocation\n### Impact\nTurboBoost\
  \ Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command\
  \ classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren't as robust as they should be.\
  \ It's possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods than should be permitted\
  \ depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual applications enforce.\
  \ Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications.\n\n#### Details\n\
  Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and that the method requested is defined\
  \ as a public method; however, this isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code\
  \ execution. The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before\
  \ allowing them to be executed.  \n\n### Patches\nPatched in the following versions.\n- 0.1.3\n\
  \  - [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turbo-boost/commands/v/0.1.3)\n  - [Ruby\
  \ GEM](https://rubygems.org/gems/turbo_boost-commands/versions/0.1.3)\n- 0.2.2\n  - [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turbo-boost/commands/v/0.2.2)\n\
  \  - [Ruby GEM](https://rubygems.org/gems/turbo_boost-commands/versions/0.2.2)\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  You can add this guard to mitigate the issue if running an unpatched version of the library.\n\
  \n```ruby\nclass ApplicationCommand < TurboBoost::Commands::Command\n  before_command do\n\
  \    method_name = params[:name].include?(\"#\") ? params[:name].split(\"#\").last : :perform\n\
  \    ancestors = self.class.ancestors[0..self.class.ancestors.index(TurboBoost::Commands::Command)\
  \ - 1]\n    allowed = ancestors.any? { |a| a.public_instance_methods(false).any? method_name.to_sym\
  \ }\n    throw :abort unless allowed # ← blocks invocation\n    # raise \"Invalid Command\"\
  \ unless allowed # ← blocks invocation\n  end\nend\n```"
