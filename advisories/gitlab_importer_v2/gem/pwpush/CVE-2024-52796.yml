summary: |
  Password Pusher rate limiter can be bypassed by forging proxy headers
  Password Pusher comes with a configurable rate limiter.  In versions prior to [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0), the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service.

  Additionally, with the ability to bypass rate limiting, it also allows attackers to more easily execute brute force attacks.
