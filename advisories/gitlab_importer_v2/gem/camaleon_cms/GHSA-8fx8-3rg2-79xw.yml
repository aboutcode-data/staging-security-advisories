summary: |
  Camaleon CMS vulnerable to stored XSS through user file upload (GHSL-2024-184)
  A stored cross-site scripting has been found in the image upload functionality that can be used by normal registered users: It is possible to upload a SVG image containing JavaScript and it's also possible to upload a HTML document when the format parameter is manually changed to [documents][1] or a string of an [unsupported format][2]. If an authenticated user or administrator visits that uploaded image or document malicious JavaScript can be executed on their behalf
  (e.g. changing or deleting content inside of the CMS.)
