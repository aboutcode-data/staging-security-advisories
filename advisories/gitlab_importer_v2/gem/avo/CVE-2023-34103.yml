summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
  Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. In affected versions some avo fields is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) when rendering html based content. Attackers do need form edit privilege in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, but the results are stored and no specific timing is required. This issue has been addressed in commit `7891c01e` which is expected to be included in the next release of avo. Users are advised to configure CSP headers for their application and to limit untrusted user access as a mitigation.
