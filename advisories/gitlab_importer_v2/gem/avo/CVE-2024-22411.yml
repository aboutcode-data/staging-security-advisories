  - GHSA-g8vp-2v5p-9qfh
summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
  Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. In Avo 3 pre12 any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction` subclass will be rendered directly without sanitization in the toast/notification that appears in the UI on Action completion. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a cross site scripting attack on an unsuspecting user. This issue has been addressed in the 3.0.0 release of Avo. Users are advised to upgrade.
