  Possible Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack’s header parsing
  There is a denial of service vulnerability in the header parsing component of Rack. Carefully crafted input can cause header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. Any applications that parse headers using Rack (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted. Workarounds Setting `Regexp.timeout` in Ruby 3.2 is a possible workaround.
