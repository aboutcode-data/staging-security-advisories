summary: |
  Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)
  agoo allows request smuggling attacks where agoo is used as a backend with a frontend proxy that is also vulnerable. It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the `Content-Length` header twice. Furthermore, invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks.
