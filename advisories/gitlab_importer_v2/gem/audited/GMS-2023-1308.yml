summary: "Race Condition leading to logging errors\nIn certain setups with threaded web servers,\
  \ Audited's use of `Thread.current` can incorrectly attributed audits to the wrong user. \n\
  \nFixed in 5.3.3. \n\nIn March, @convisoappsec noticed that the library in question had a\
  \ Race Condition problem, which caused logs to be registered at times with different users\
  \ than those who performed the genuine actions.\n\n- The first issue we identified was from\
  \ November 2021: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/issues/601 \n- So the solution\
  \ was implemented in the following Pull Request: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/669\
  \ \n- And the feature was published in version 5.3.3: RELEASE: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/671"
