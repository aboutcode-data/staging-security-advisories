  Data Handling Stack Buffer Overflow
  This package contains an overflow condition that is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling specially crafted data. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
