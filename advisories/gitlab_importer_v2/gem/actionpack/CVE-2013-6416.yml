summary: |
  XSS Vulnerability in simple_format helper
  The simple_format helper converts user supplied text into html text which is intended to be safe for display. A change made to the implementation of this helper means that any user provided HTML attributes will not be escaped correctly. As a result of this error, applications which pass user-controlled data to be included as html attributes will be vulnerable to an XSS attack.
