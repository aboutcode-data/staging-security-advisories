  - CVE-2012-1099
summary: |
  XSS via posted select tag options
  Ruby on Rails is vulnerable to remote cross-site scripting because the application does not validate manually generated `select tag options` upon submission to `actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/form_options_helper.rb`. This may allow a user to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
