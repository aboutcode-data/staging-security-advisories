summary: |
  CarrierWave content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability which possibly leads to XSS remained
  The vulnerability [CVE-2023-49090](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-gxhx-g4fq-49hj) wasn't fully addressed.

  This vulnerability is caused by the fact that when uploading to object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Type value that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowed by `content_type_allowlist`, by providing multiple values separated by commas.

  This bypassed value can be used to cause XSS.
