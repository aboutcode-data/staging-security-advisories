summary: |
  rails-ujs vulnerable to DOM Based Cross-site Scripting contenteditable HTML Elements
  NOTE: rails-ujs is part of Rails/actionview since 5.1.0.

  There is a potential DOM based cross-site scripting issue in rails-ujs
  which leverages the Clipboard API to target HTML elements that are
  assigned the contenteditable attribute. This has the potential to
  occur when pasting malicious HTML content from the clipboard that
  includes a data-method, data-remote or data-disable-with attribute.

  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-23913.

  Not affected: < 5.1.0
  Versions Affected: >= 5.1.0
  Fixed Versions: 6.1.7.3, 7.0.4.3

  Impact
  If the specified malicious HTML clipboard content is provided to a
  contenteditable element, this could result in the arbitrary execution
  of javascript on the origin in question.

  Releases
  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.

  Workarounds
  We recommend that all users upgrade to one of the FIXED versions.
  In the meantime, users can attempt to mitigate this vulnerability
  by removing the contenteditable attribute from elements in pages
  that rails-ujs will interact with.

  Patches
  To aid users who aren’t able to upgrade immediately we have provided
  patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am
  format and consist of a single changeset.

  * rails-ujs-data-method-contenteditable-6-1.patch - Patch for 6.1 series
  * rails-ujs-data-method-contenteditable-7-0.patch - Patch for 7.0 series

  Please note that only the 7.0.Z and 6.1.Z series are
  supported at present, and 6.0.Z for severe vulnerabilities.

  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as
  soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability
  of security fixes for unsupported releases.
