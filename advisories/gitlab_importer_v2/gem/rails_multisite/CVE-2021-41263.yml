summary: |
  Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
  rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications.Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.
