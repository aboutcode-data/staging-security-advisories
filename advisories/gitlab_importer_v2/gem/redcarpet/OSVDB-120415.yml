  XSS via parse_inline()
  There's a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the `parse_inline()` function in markdown.c does not validate input before returning it to users. This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
