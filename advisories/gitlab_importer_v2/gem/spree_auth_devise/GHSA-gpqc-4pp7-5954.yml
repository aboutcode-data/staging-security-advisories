summary: |
  Duplicate Advisory: Authentication Bypass by CSRF Weakness
  CSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover.

  All applications using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise` are affected if `protect_from_forgery` method is both:

  * Executed whether as:
  * A before_action callback (the default)
  * A prepend_before_action (option prepend: true given) before the :load_object hook in Spree::UserController (most likely order to find).
  * Configured to use :null_session or :reset_session strategies (:null_session is the default in case the no strategy is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception).

  That means that applications that haven't been configured differently from what it's generated with Rails aren't affected.

  Thanks @waiting-for-dev for reporting and providing a patch 👏
