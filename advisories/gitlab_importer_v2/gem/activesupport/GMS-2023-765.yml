summary: |
  Possible XSS Security Vulnerability in SafeBuffer#bytesplice
  There is a vulnerability in ActiveSupport if the new bytesplice method is called on a SafeBuffer with untrusted user input.
  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-28120.

  Versions Affected: All. Not affected: None Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.3, 6.1.7.3

  # Impact

  ActiveSupport uses the SafeBuffer string subclass to tag strings as html_safe after they have been sanitized.
  When these strings are mutated, the tag is should be removed to mark them as no longer being html_safe.

  Ruby 3.2 introduced a new bytesplice method which ActiveSupport does not yet understand to be a mutation.
  Users on older versions of Ruby are likely unaffected.

  All users running an affected release and using bytesplice should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

  # Workarounds

  Avoid calling bytesplice on a SafeBuffer (html_safe) string with untrusted user input.
