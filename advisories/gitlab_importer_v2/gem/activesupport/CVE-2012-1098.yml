summary: |
  Direct Manipulation XSS
  Ruby on Rails contains a flaw that allows a remote cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the application does not validate direct manipulations of `SafeBuffer` objects via `'[]'` and other methods. This may allow a user to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
