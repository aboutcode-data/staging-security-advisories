summary: |
  Content type spoofing vulnerability
  There is an issue where if an HTML file is uploaded with a `.html` extension, but the content type is listed as being `image/jpeg`, this will bypass a validation checking for images. But it will also pass the spoof check, because a file named `.html` and containing actual HTML passes the spoof check.
