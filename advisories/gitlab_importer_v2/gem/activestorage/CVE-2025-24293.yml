  - GHSA-r4mg-4433-c7g3
summary: |
  Active Storage allowed transformation methods that were potentially unsafe
  Active Storage attempts to prevent the use of potentially unsafe image transformation methods and parameters by default.

  The default allowed list contains three methods allowing for the circumvention of the safe defaults which enables potential command injection vulnerabilities in cases where arbitrary user supplied input is accepted as valid transformation methods or parameters.

  This has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2025-24293.


  Versions Affected:  >= 5.2.0
  Not affected:       < 5.2.0
  Fixed Versions:     7.1.5.2, 7.2.2.2, 8.0.2.1

  Impact
  ------
  This vulnerability impacts applications that use Active Storage with the image_processing processing gem in addition to mini_magick as the image processor.

  Vulnerable code will look something similar to this:

  ```
  <%= image_tag blob.variant(params[:t] => params[:v]) %>
  ```

  Where the transformation method or its arguments are untrusted arbitrary input.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

  Releases
  --------
  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  Consuming user supplied input for image transformation methods or their parameters is unsupported behavior and should be considered dangerous.

  Strict validation of user supplied methods and parameters should be performed as well as having a strong [ImageMagick security policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php) deployed.
