summary: |
  Reflective XSS Vulnerability
  The gem contains a flaw that enables a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the bootstrap_flash helper method does not validate input when handling flash messages before returning it to users. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server.
