  Duplicate Advisory: Use-after-free in libxml2 via Nokogiri::XML::Reader
  Nokogiri upgrades its dependency libxml2 as follows:
  - v1.15.6 upgrades libxml2 to 2.11.7 from 2.11.6
  - v1.16.2 upgrades libxml2 to 2.12.5 from 2.12.4

  libxml2 v2.11.7 and v2.12.5 address the following vulnerability:

  CVE-2024-25062 / https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25062
  - described at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/604
  - patched by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/92721970

  Please note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri, and only if
  the packaged libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use
  system libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's
  libxml2 release announcements.

  JRuby users are not affected.
