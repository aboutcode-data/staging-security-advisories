summary: |
  Rails has possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage
  # Possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage

  There is a possible sensitive session information leak in Active Storage.  By
  default, Active Storage sends a `Set-Cookie` header along with the user's
  session cookie when serving blobs.  It also sets `Cache-Control` to public.
  Certain proxies may cache the Set-Cookie, leading to an information leak.

  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26144.

  Versions Affected:  >= 5.2.0, < 7.1.0
  Not affected:       < 5.2.0, > 7.1.0
  Fixed Versions:     7.0.8.1, 6.1.7.7

  Impact
  ------
  A proxy which chooses to caches this request can cause users to share
  sessions. This may include a user receiving an attacker's session or vice
  versa.

  This was patched in 7.1.0 but not previously identified as a security
  vulnerability.

  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately.

  Releases
  --------
  The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

  Workarounds
  -----------
  Upgrade to Rails 7.1.X, or configure caching proxies not to cache the
  Set-Cookie headers.
