summary: |
  Doorkeeper Improper Authentication vulnerability
  OAuth RFC 8252 says  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-8.6

  > the authorization server SHOULD NOT process authorization requests automatically without user consent or interaction, except when the identity of the client can be assured. **This includes the case where the user has previously approved an authorization request for a given client id**

  But Doorkeeper automatically processes authorization requests without user consent for public clients that have been previously approved. Public clients are inherently vulnerable to impersonation, their identity cannot be assured.
