  - CVE-2018-1000088
summary: |
  XSS on authorization consent view
  Stored XSS on the OAuth Client's name will cause users being prompted for consent via the `implicit` grant type to execute the XSS payload. The XSS attack could gain access to the user's active session, resulting in account compromise. Any user is susceptible if they click the authorization link for the malicious OAuth client. Because of how the links work, a user cannot tell if a link is malicious or not without first visiting the page with the XSS payload. In addition, there is stored XSS in the `native_redirect_uri` form element.
