  - GHSA-9c54-gxh7-ppjc
summary: |
  Local Deep Research is Vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Download Service
  The download service (`download_service.py`) makes HTTP requests using raw `requests.get()` without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (`safe_requests.py`). This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud provider metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network reconnaissance, by submitting malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment and surrounding controls.

  **CWE**: CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)
