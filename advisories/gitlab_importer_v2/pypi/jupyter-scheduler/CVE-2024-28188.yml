summary: |
  jupyter-scheduler's endpoint is missing authentication
  `jupyter_scheduler` is missing an authentication check in Jupyter Server on an API endpoint (`GET /scheduler/runtime_environments`) which lists the names of the Conda environments on the server. In affected versions, `jupyter_scheduler` allows an unauthenticated user to obtain the list of Conda environment names on the server. This reveals any information that may be present in a Conda environment name.

  This issue does **not** allow an unauthenticated third party to read, modify, or enter the Conda environments present on the server where `jupyter_scheduler` is running. This issue only reveals the list of Conda environment names.

  Impacted versions: `>=1.0.0,<=1.1.5 ; ==1.2.0 ; >=1.3.0,<=1.8.1 ; >=2.0.0,<=2.5.1`
