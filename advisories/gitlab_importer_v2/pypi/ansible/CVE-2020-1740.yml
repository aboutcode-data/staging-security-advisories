summary: |
  Information Exposure
  A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when using Ansible Vault for editing encrypted files. When a user executes `ansible-vault edit`, another user on the same computer can read the old and new secret, as it is created in a temporary file with mkstemp and the returned file descriptor is closed and the method write_data is called to write the existing secret in the file. This method will delete the file before recreating it insecurely.
