  snowflake-connector-python vulnerable to insecure cache files permissions
  ### Issue
  Snowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake Connector for Python. On Linux systems, when temporary credential caching is enabled, the Snowflake Connector for Python will cache temporary credentials locally in a world-readable file.

  This vulnerability affects versions 2.3.7 through 3.13.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.13.1.

  ### Vulnerability Details
  On Linux, when either EXTERNALBROWSER or USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA authentication methods are used with temporary credential caching enabled, the Snowflake Connector for Python will cache the temporary credentials in a local file.
