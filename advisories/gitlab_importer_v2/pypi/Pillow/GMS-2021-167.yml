  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in pillow
  ### Impact
  _Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service  because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large._

  ### Patches
  _An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0. When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the library can either allocate very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to process the image._

  ### Workarounds
  _An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0. When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the library can either allocate very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to process the image._
