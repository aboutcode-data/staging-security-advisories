summary: "tuf's Metadata API:  Targets.get_delegated_role() is missing input validation\nThe\
  \ security of both a TUF client and repository implementations depend on the concept of trusted\
  \ Metadata objects verifying the signatures over other Metadata that it delegates to. This\
  \ verification process uses `Targets.get_delegated_role(delegated_role: str)` to find the\
  \ delegation information.\n\n`tuf.api.metadata.Targets.get_delegated_role()` should ensure\
  \ that the given `delegated_rolename` is actually a name of a role that is delegated by that\
  \ Targets, but in the case of \"succinct delegation\" this does not happen.\n\n`tuf.ngclient`\
  \ users are **not** impacted but direct users of `tuf.api.metadata` could be impacted.\n\n\
  ### Impact\n\nIf an attacker can make a Metadata API user run `Targets.get_delegated_role()`\
  \ so that \n1. the `Targets` uses succinct delegation\n1. the `delegated_role` argument is\
  \ not actually delegated by the `Targets`\n\nthe result will be incorrect.\n\nThis also means\
  \ that if an attacker can make a Metadata API user run `Targets.verify_delegate()` or `Targets.get_verification_result()`\
  \ so that\n1. the delegating `Targets` uses a succinct delegation\n1. the `delegated_role`\
  \ argument is the name of some unrelated Metadata\n1. that other Metadata is correctly signed\
  \ by the keys defined in the succinct delegation\n\nthe result would be a successful verification\
  \ even though the `Targets` in question does not actually delegate to `delegated_role`.\n\n\
  The impact is estimated to be low for following reasons:\n\n* This cannot impact a TUF client\
  \ that implements the client workflow as specified since the delegated role name is not an\
  \ input but is collected from the (trusted) delegating Targets itself\n* Actual signature\
  \ verification is not bypassed: The verified metadata _must_ still be correctly signed by\
  \ the keys specified in the delegating role.\n* The described situations are somewhat hypothetical:\
  \ there does not seem to be any reason for a python-tuf user (whether client or a repository)\
  \ to use `tuf.api.metadata` in this way.\n\nAll users of `tuf.ngclient` are specifically **not**\
  \ impacted. Users of `tuf.api.metadata` could be impacted if they use succinct delegations\
  \ in a way described above.\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix is available in python-tuf 3.1.1 as commit\
  \ 77cb66bc and in later releases as commit eb4834d9._\n\n### Workarounds\n\n`tuf.api.metadata`\
  \ users should only call `Targets.get_delegated_role()`, `Targets.verify_delegate()` or `Targets.get_verification_result()`\
  \ with `delegated_role` argument that is known to be delegated by the `Targets` in question."
