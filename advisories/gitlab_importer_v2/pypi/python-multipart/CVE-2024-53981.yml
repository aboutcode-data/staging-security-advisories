aliases:
  - CVE-2024-53981
  - GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3
summary: |
  Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary
  When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\r` or LF `\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.

  An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
