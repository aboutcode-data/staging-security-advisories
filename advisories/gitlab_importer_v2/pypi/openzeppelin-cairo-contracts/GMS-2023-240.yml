  - GHSA-626q-v9j4-mcp4
  - GMS-2023-240
summary: "OpenZeppelin Contracts contains Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n\
  ### Cause\n`is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to `finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`.\
  \ \n\n### Impact\nAs a result, any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account\
  \ library (such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious sequencer. Specifically,\
  \ the malicious sequencer would be able to bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance\
  \ of these accounts.\n\n### Risk\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, it is required to\
  \ control a sequencer or prover since they're the ones executing the hints, being able to\
  \ inject incorrect keccak results.\n\nToday StarkWare is the only party running both a prover\
  \ or a sequencer, greatly reducing the risk of exploit.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been\
  \ patched in 0.6.1.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about\
  \ this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Contracts for Cairo repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/new/choose)\n\
