summary: |
  OctoPrint is Vulnerable to RCE Attacks via Unsanitized Filename in File Upload
  OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an **authenticated** attacker to upload a file under a specially crafted filename that will allow arbitrary command execution if said filename becomes included in a command defined in a system event handler and said event gets triggered.

  If no event handlers executing system commands with uploaded filenames as parameters have been configured, this vulnerability does not have an impact.
