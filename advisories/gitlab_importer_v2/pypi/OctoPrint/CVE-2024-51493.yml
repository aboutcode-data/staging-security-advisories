summary: |
  OctoPrint has API key access in settings without reauthentication
  OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker that has gained temporary control over an authenticated victim's OctoPrint browser session to retrieve/recreate/delete the user's or - if the victim has admin permissions - the global API key without having to reauthenticate by re-entering the user account's password.

  An attacker could use a stolen API key to access OctoPrint through its API, or disrupt workflows depending on the API key they deleted.
