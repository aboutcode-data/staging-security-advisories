  vLLM Allows Remote Code Execution via PyNcclPipe Communication Service
  vLLM supports the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​

  A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the `PyNcclPipe` service. Attackers can exploit this by sending malicious serialized data to gain server control privileges.

  The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network: https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/security.html

  Unfortunately, the default behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface will listen on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface.

  This issue was reported privately to PyTorch and they determined that this behavior was intentional.
