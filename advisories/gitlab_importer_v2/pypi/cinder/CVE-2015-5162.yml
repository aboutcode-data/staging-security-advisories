summary: |
  OpenStack Cinder, Glance, and Nova contain Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
  A resource vulnerability in the OpenStack Compute (nova), Block Storage (cinder), and Image (glance) services was found in their use of qemu-img. An unprivileged user could consume as much as 4 GB of RAM on the compute host by uploading a malicious image. This flaw could lead possibly to host out-of-memory errors and negatively affect other running tenant instances. oslo.concurrency has been updated to support process limits ('prlimit'), which is needed to fix this flaw.
