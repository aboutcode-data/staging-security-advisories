summary: "Fides Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability in Custom Integration Upload\n###\
  \ Impact\n\nThe Fides web application allows a custom integration to be uploaded as a ZIP\
  \ file containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format. \n\nIt was discovered\
  \ that specially crafted YAML dataset and config files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary\
  \ requests to internal systems and exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as\
  \ a Server-Side Request Forgery). The application does not perform proper validation to block\
  \ attempts to connect to internal (including localhost) resources.\n\nExploitation is limited\
  \ to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides\
  \ Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and\
  \ users with the owner role.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version\
  \ `2.22.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems\
  \ against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds."
