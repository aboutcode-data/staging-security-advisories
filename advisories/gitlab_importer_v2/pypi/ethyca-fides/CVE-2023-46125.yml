summary: "Fides Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Config API Endpoint\n### Impact\nThe\
  \ Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config`\
  \ endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information\
  \ before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about\
  \ the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers’ addresses\
  \ and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as\
  \ well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users.\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve\
  \ the config information using the API. \n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched\
  \ in Fides version `2.22.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure\
  \ their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds."
