summary: |
  CSRF can expose users authentication token
  ### Issue
  The  /login and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication token.

  ### Patches
  Version 3.4.5 and soon to be released 4.0.0 are patched.

  ### Workarounds
  If you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to "0" (seconds) which should make the token unusable.

  ### References
