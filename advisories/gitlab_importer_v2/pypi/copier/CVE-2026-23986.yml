summary: |
  Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem write access via directory symlinks when _preserve_symlinks: true
  Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe) features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently write to arbitrary directories outside the destination path by using directory a symlink along with [`_preserve_symlinks: true`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#preserve_symlinks) and a [generated directory structure](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#generating-a-directory-structure) whose rendered path is inside the symlinked directory. This way, a malicious template author can create a template that overwrites arbitrary files (according to the user's write permissions), e.g., to cause havoc.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > At the time of writing, the exploit is non-deterministic, as Copier walks the template's file tree using [`os.scandir`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir) which yields directory entries in arbitrary order.

  Reproducible example (may or may not work depending on directory entry yield order):

  ```shell
  mkdir other/
  pushd other/
  echo "sensitive" > sensitive.txt
  popd

  mkdir src/
  pushd src/
  ln -s ../other other
  echo "overwritten" > "{{ pathjoin('other', 'sensitive.txt') }}.jinja"
  echo "_preserve_symlinks: true" > copier.yml
  tree .
