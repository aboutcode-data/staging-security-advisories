summary: |
  Copier safe template has arbitrary filesystem read access via symlinks when _preserve_symlinks: false
  Copier suggests that it's safe to generate a project from a safe template, i.e. one that doesn't use [unsafe](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#unsafe) features like custom Jinja extensions which would require passing the `--UNSAFE,--trust` flag. As it turns out, a safe template can currently include arbitrary files/directories outside the local template clone location by using symlinks along with [`_preserve_symlinks: false`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#preserve_symlinks) (which is Copier's default setting).

  Imagine, e.g., a malicious template author who creates a template that reads SSH keys or other secrets from well-known locations and hopes for a user to push the generated project to a public location like [github.com](https://github.com/) where the template author can extract the secrets.

  Reproducible example:

  - Illegally include a file in the generated project via symlink resolution:

  ```shell
  echo "s3cr3t" > secret.txt

  mkdir src/
  pushd src/
  ln -s ../secret.txt stolen-secret.txt
  popd

  uvx copier copy src/ dst/

  cat dst/stolen-secret.txt
