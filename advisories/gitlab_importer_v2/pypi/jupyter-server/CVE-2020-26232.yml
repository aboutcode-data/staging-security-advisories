  Open redirect in Jupyter Server
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Open redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.

  All jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.

  This originated in jupyter/notebook: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/security/advisories/GHSA-c7vm-f5p4-8fqh
