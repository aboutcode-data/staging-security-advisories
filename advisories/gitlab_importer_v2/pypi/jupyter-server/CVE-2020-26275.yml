  Jupyter Server open redirect vulnerability
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  Open redirect vulnerability - a maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website.

  All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8.
