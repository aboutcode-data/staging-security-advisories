  internetarchive Vulnerable to Directory Traversal in File.download()
  **What kind of vulnerability is it?**
  This is a **Critical** severity directory traversal (path traversal) vulnerability in the `File.download()` method of the `internetarchive` library.

  **Who is impacted?**
  All users of the `internetarchive` library versions `< 5.5.1` are impacted. The vulnerability is particularly critical for users on **Windows systems**, but all operating systems are affected.

  **Description of the vulnerability:**
  The vulnerability existed because the `file.download()` method did not properly sanitize user-supplied filenames or validate the final download path. A maliciously crafted filename could contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../windows/system32/file.txt`) or illegal characters that, when processed, would cause the file to be written outside of the intended target directory.

  **Potential Impact:**
  An attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files or application configuration files, leading to a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution, depending on the context in which the library is used.
