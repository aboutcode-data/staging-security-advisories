  - GHSA-43qf-4rqw-9q2g
summary: |
  Flask-CORS vulnerable to Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
  corydolphin/flask-cors version 5.0.1 contains a vulnerability where the request path matching is case-insensitive due to the use of the `try_match` function, which is originally intended for matching hosts. This results in a mismatch because paths in URLs are case-sensitive, but the regex matching treats them as case-insensitive. This misconfiguration can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized origins to access paths meant to be restricted, resulting in data exposure and potential data leaks.
