aliases:
  - CVE-2021-3840
  - GHSA-hgc3-hp6x-wpgx
summary: A dependency confusion vulnerability was reported in the Antilles open-source software
  that could allow for remote code execution during installation due to a package listed in
  requirements.txt not existing in the public package index (PyPi). MITRE classifies this weakness
  as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package dependency may
  be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known public repository
  such as PyPi. The configuration has been updated to only install components built by Antilles,
  removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has
  been published to PyPi.
