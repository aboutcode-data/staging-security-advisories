summary: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound in TensorFlow\n### Impact\nThe Grappler component of\
  \ TensorFlow is vulnerable to a denial of service via `CHECK`-failure  in constant folding\
  \  for ;\n    // ...\n  }\n```\n  \nThe `output_prop` tensor has a shape that is controlled\
  \ by user input and this can result in triggering one of the `CHECK`s in the `PartialTensorShape`\
  \ constructor. This is an instance of TFSA-2021-198 .\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the\
  \ issue in GitHub commit be7b286d40bc68cb0b56f702186cc4837d508058 fix will be included in\
  \ TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3,\
  \ and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For\
  \ more information\nPlease consult [our security guide] for more information regarding the\
  \ security model and how to contact us with issues and questions."
