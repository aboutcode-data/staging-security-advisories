summary: |
  TensorFlow vulnerable to `CHECK` failures in `UnbatchGradOp`
  TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `UnbatchGradOp` function takes an argument `id` that is assumed to be a scalar. A nonscalar `id` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program. It also requires its argument `batch_index` to contain three times the number of elements as indicated in its `batch_index.dim_size(0)`. An incorrect `batch_index` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5f945fc6409a3c1e90d6970c9292f805f6e6ddf2. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
