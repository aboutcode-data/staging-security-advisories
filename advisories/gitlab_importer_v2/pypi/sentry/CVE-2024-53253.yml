summary: |
  Sentry improper error handling leaks Application Integration Client Secret
  During routine testing, we identified a scenario where a specific error message generated by our platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions:
  - An app installation made use of a [Search UI component](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield/#select) with the `async` flag set to true (default: true),
  - A user types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results, and
  - That third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret.

  Should this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application.
