summary: |
  LLaMA-Factory allows Code Injection through improper vhead_file safeguards
  A critical remote code execution vulnerability was discovered during the Llama Factory training process. This vulnerability arises because the `vhead_file` is loaded without proper safeguards, allowing malicious attackers to execute arbitrary malicious code on the host system simply by passing a malicious `Checkpoint path` parameter through the `WebUI` interface. The attack is stealthy, as the victim remains unaware of the exploitation. The root cause is that the `vhead_file` argument is loaded without the secure parameter `weights_only=True`.

  Note: In torch versions <2.6, the default setting is `weights_only=False`, and Llama Factory's `setup.py` only requires `torch>=2.0.0`.
