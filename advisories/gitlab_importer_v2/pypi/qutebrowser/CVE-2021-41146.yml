summary: |
  Arbitrary command execution on Windows via qutebrowserurl: URL handler
  Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser registers it as a handler for certain URL schemes. With some applications such as Outlook Desktop, opening a specially crafted URL can lead to argument injection, allowing execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`.

  Only Windows installs where qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. It does *not* have to be set as default browser for the exploit to work.
