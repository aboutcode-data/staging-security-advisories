summary: |
  Ray is vulnerable to Critical RCE via Safari & Firefox Browsers through DNS Rebinding Attack
  Developers working with Ray as a development tool can be exploited via a critical RCE vulnerability exploitable via Firefox and Safari.

  Due to the longstanding [decision](https://docs.ray.io/en/releases-2.51.1/ray-security/index.html) by the Ray Development team to not implement any sort of authentication on critical endpoints, like the `/api/jobs` & `/api/job_agent/jobs/` has once again led to a severe vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code against Ray. This time in a development context via the browsers Firefox and Safari.

  This vulnerability is due to an insufficient guard against browser-based attacks, as the current defense uses the `User-Agent` header starting with the string "Mozilla" as a defense mechanism. This defense is insufficient as the fetch specification allows the `User-Agent` header to be modified.

  Combined with a DNS rebinding attack against the browser, and this vulnerability is exploitable against a developer running Ray who inadvertently visits a malicious website, or is served a malicious advertisement ([malvertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising)).
