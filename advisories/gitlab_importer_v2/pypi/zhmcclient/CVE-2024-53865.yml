  * The 'ssc-master-pw' and 'zaware-master-pw' properties when updating an LPAR in classic mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs
  * The 'ssc-master-pw' and 'zaware-master-pw' properties when creating or updating an image activation profile in classic mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs
  * The 'password' property when creating or updating an HMC user, in the zhmcclient API log
  * The 'bind-password' property when creating or updating an LDAP server definition, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs
