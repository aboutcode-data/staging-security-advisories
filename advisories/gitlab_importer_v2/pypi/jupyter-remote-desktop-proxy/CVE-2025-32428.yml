  - GHSA-vrq4-9hc3-cgp7
summary: |
  TigerVNC accessible via the network and not just via a UNIX socket as intended
  `jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy` was meant to rely on UNIX sockets readable only by the current user since version 3.0.0, but when used with TigerVNC, the VNC server started by `jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy` were still accessible via the network.

  This vulnerability does not affect users having TurboVNC as the `vncserver` executable.
