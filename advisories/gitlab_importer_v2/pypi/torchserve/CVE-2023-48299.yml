  - GHSA-m2mj-pr4f-h9jp
summary: |
  TorchServe ZipSlip
  ### Impact
  Using the model/workflow management API, there is a chance of uploading potentially harmful archives that contain files that are extracted to any location on the filesystem that is within the process permissions. Leveraging this issue could aid third-party actors in hiding harmful code in open-source/public models, which can be downloaded from the internet, and take advantage of machines running Torchserve.

  ### Patches
  The ZipSlip issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the paths of files contained within a zip archive before extracting them: https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2634

  TorchServe release 0.9.0 includes fixes to address the ZipSlip vulnerability:
  https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.9.0
