summary: |
  concat built-in can corrupt memory in vyper
  `concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `>=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function).

  A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.
