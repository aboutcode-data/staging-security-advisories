summary: |
  vyper performs incorrect topic logging in raw_log
  Incorrect values can be logged when `raw_log` builtin is called with memory or storage arguments to be used as topics.

  A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. In particular, no uses of `raw_log()` were found at all in production; it is apparently not a well-known function.
