summary: |
  vyper default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys
  Prior to v0.3.0, `__default__()` functions did not respect the `@nonreentrancy` decorator and the lock was not emitted. This is a known bug and was already visible in the issue tracker (https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2455), but it is being re-issued as an advisory so that tools relying on the advisory publication list can incorporate it into their searches.

  A contract search was additionally performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.
