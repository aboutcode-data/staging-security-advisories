summary: "datasette-graphql leaks details of the schema of private database files\n### Impact\n\
  \nWhen running against a Datasette instance with private databases, `datasette-graphql` would\
  \ expose the schema of those database tables - but not the table contents.\n\n### Patches\n\
  \nPatched \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis issue is only present if a Datasette instance that includes\
  \ private databases and has the `datasette-graphql` plugin installed is available on the public\
  \ internet. Uninstalling the `datasette-graphql` plugin or preventing public access to the\
  \ instance can workaround this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions\
  \ or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [datasette-graphql](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql)\n\
