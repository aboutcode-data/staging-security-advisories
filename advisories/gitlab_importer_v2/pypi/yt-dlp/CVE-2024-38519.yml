  - CVE-2024-38519
  - GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j
summary: |
  yt-dlp File system modification and RCE through improper file-extension sanitization
  `yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the yt-dlp directory) this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.
