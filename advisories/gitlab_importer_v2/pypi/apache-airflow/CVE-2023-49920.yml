summary: |
  Apache Airflow Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability
  Apache Airflow, version 2.7.0 through 2.7.3, has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to trigger a DAG in a GET request without CSRF validation. As a result, it was possible for a malicious website opened in the same browser - by the user who also had Airflow UI opened - to trigger the execution of DAGs without the user's consent.
  Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or later which is not affected
