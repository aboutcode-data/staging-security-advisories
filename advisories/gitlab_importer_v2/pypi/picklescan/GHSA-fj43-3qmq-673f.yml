summary: |
  Picklescan failed to detect to some unsafe global function in Numpy library
  An unsafe deserialization vulnerability in Python’s pickle module allows an attacker to bypass static analysis tools like Picklescan and execute arbitrary code during deserialization. This can be exploited by import some built-in function in Numpy library that indrectly call some dangerous function like exec() to execute some python code as a parameter, which the attacker can import dangerous library inside like os library and execute arbitrary OS commands.
