  Duplicate Advisory: Picklescan Bypass is Possible via File Extension Mismatch
  ### Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-jgw4-cr84-mqxg. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ### Original Description
  An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the scanning logic of mmaitre314 picklescan versions up to and including 0.0.30 allows a remote attacker to bypass pickle files security checks by supplying a standard pickle file with a PyTorch-related file extension. When the pickle file incorrectly considered safe is loaded, it can lead to the execution of malicious code.
