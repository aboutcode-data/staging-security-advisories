  Duplicate Advisory: Qiskit allows arbitrary code execution decoding QPY format versions < 13
  # Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6m2c-76ff-6vrf. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  # Original Description
  A maliciously crafted QPY file can potential execute arbitrary-code embedded in the payload without privilege escalation when deserialising QPY formats < 13. A python process calling Qiskit 0.18.0 through 1.4.1's `qiskit.qpy.load()` function could potentially execute any arbitrary Python code embedded in the correct place in the binary file as part of specially constructed payload.
