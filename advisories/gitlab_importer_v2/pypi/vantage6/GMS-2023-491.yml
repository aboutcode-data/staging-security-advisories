summary: |
  vantage6 vulnerable to Observable Response Discrepancy
  ### Impact
  We are incorporating the password policies listed in https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/59. One measure is that we don't let the user know in case of wrong username/password combination if the username actually exists, to prevent that bots can guess usernames. However, if a wrong password is entered a number of times, the user account is blocked temporarily. This way you could still find out which usernames exist.

  ### Patches
  Update to 3.8.0+

  ### Workarounds
  No
