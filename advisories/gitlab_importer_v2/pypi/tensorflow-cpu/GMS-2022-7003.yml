summary: |
  Out of bounds write in grappler in Tensorflow
  ### Impact
  The function [MakeGrapplerFunctionItem](https://https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/utils/functions.cc#L221) takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered.

  ### Patches
  We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7) .

  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1.
