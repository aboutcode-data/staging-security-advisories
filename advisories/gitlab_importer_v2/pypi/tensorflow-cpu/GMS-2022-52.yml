summary: "NULL Pointer Dereference and Access of Uninitialized Pointer in TensorFlow\n### Impact\
  \ \nThe code for boosted trees in TensorFlow is still missing validation. This allows malicious\
  \ users to read and write outside of bounds of heap allocated data as well as trigger denial\
  \ of service (via dereferencing `nullptr`s or via `CHECK`-failures).\n\nThis follows after\
  \ CVE-2021-41208 where these APIs were still vulnerable to multiple security issues.\n\n**Note**:\
  \ Given that the boosted trees implementation in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend\
  \ to no longer use these APIs.  Instead, please use the downstream [TensorFlow Decision Forests]\
  \ project which is newer and supports more features. \n  \nThese APIs are now deprecated in\
  \ TensorFlow 2.8. We will remove TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs in subsequent releases.\n\
  \  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the known issues in multiple GitHub commits.\n  \nThe fix\
  \ will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow\
  \ 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported\
  \ range.\n\nThis should allow users to use existing boosted trees APIs for a while until they\
  \ migrate to TensorFlow Decision Forests while guaranteeing that known vulnerabilities are\
  \ fixed.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult our security guide for more information\
  \ regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\n\
  These vulnerabilities have been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team and Faysal Hossain\
  \ Shezan from University of Virginia. Some of the issues have been discovered internally after\
  \ a careful audit of the APIs."
