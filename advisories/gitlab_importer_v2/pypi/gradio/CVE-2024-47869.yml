  - CVE-2024-47869
  - GHSA-j757-pf57-f8r4
summary: |
  Gradio performs a non-constant-time comparison when comparing hashes
  **What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**

  This vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query the system with different keys.
