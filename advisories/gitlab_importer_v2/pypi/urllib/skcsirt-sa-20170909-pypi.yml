summary: |
  Fake package, execution of benign malware
  Copies of several well known Python packages were published under slightly modified names in the official Python package repository PyPI (prominent example includes urllib vs. urrlib3, bzip vs. bzip2, etc.). These packages contain the exact same code as their upstream package thus their functionality is the same, but the installation script, setup.py, is modified to include a malicious (but relatively benign) code.
