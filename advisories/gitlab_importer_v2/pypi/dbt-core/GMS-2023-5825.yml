summary: |
  dbt-core's secret env vars written to package-lock.json in plaintext
  ### Impact

  When used to pull source code from a private repository using a Personal Access Token (PAT), some versions of dbt-core write a URL with the PAT in plaintext to the `package-lock.yml` file.

  ### Patches

  The bug has been fixed in [dbt-core v1.7.3](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.7.3).

  ### Mitigations

  Remove any git URLs with plaintext secrets from `package-lock.yml` file(s) on servers, workstations, or in source control. Rotate any tokens that have been written to version-controlled files.
