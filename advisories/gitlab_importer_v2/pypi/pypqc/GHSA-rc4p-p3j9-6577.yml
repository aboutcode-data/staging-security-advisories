summary: "pypqc private key retrieval vulnerability\n### Impact\nFor `kyber512`, `kyber768`,\
  \ and `kyber1024` only: An attacker able to submit many ciphertexts against a single private\
  \ key, and to get responses in real-time, could recover the private key. This attack has been\
  \ named KyberSlash\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C\n\n### Patches\n\
  Version 0.0.6.1 and newer of PyPQC is patched.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds have been\
  \ reported. The 0.0.6 -> 0.0.6.1 upgrade should be a drop-in replacement; it has no known\
  \ breaking changes.\n\n### References\n1. This was partially patched (\"KyberSlash 1\") in\
