summary: |
  Observable Timing Discrepancy in pypqc
  `kyber512`, `kyber768`, and `kyber1024` on Mac OS \(or when compiled with clang\) only: An attacker able to submit many decapsulation requests against a single private key, and to gain timing information about the decapsulation, could recover the private key. Proof-of-concept exploit exists for a local attacker.
