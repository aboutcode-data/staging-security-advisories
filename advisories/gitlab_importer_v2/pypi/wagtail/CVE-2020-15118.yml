summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting in Wagtail
  When a form page type is made available to Wagtail editors through the `wagtail.contrib.forms` app, and the page template is built using Django's standard form rendering helpers such as `form.as_p` ([as directed in the documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/contrib/forms/index.html#usage)), any HTML tags used within a form field's help text will be rendered unescaped in the page. Allowing HTML within help text is [an intentional design decision](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.help_text) by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users.

  The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.
