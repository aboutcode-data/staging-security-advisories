summary: |
  Indico vulnerable to Cross-Site-Scripting via confirmation prompts
  There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation prompts commonly used when deleting content from Indico.
  Exploitation requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content.

  Considering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk of such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased when combined with some some social engineering pointing the victim towards this content.
