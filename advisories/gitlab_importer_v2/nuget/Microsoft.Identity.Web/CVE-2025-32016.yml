  Microsoft Identity Web Exposes Client Secrets and Certificate Information in Service Logs
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  **Description:** This vulnerability affects confidential client applications, including daemons, web apps, and web APIs. Under specific circumstances, sensitive information such as client secrets or certificate details may be exposed in the service logs of these applications. Service logs are intended to be handled securely.

  **Impact:** The vulnerability impacts service logs that meet the following criteria:

  - **Logging Level:** Logs are generated at the information level.
  - **Credential Descriptions:** containing:
  - Local file paths with passwords.
  - Base64 encoded values.
  - Client secret.

  Additionally, logs of services using Base64 encoded certificates or certificate paths with password credential descriptions are also affected if the certificates are invalid or expired, regardless of the log level. Note that these credentials are not usable due to their invalid or expired status.

  If your service logs are handled securely, you are not impacted.

  Otherwise, the following table shows when you can be impacted
  | Log Level Information for Microsoft.Identity.Web | Invalid Certificate
  -- | -- | --
  One of the ClientCredentials credential description has a CredentialSource = Base64Encoded or (CredentialSource = Path) | Impacted | Impacted
  One of the ClientCredentials credential description is a Client secret (CredentialSource = ClientSecret) | Impacted | Not impacted
  Other credential descriptions | Not Impacted | Not Impacted
