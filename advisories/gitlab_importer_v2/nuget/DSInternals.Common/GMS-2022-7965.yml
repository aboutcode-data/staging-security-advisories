  DSInternals Credential Roaming Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
  A vulnerability exists in the `DSInternals.Common.Data.RoamedCredential.Save()` method, which incorrectly parses the `msPKIAccountCredentials` LDAP attribute values.

A similar security issue used to be present in the Windows operating system, as DSInternals re-implements the Credential Roaming feature of Windows.
