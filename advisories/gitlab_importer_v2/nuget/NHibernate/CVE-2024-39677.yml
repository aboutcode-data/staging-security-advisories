summary: |
  NHibernate SQL injection vulnerability in discriminator mappings, static fields referenced in HQL, and some utilities
  A SQL injection vulnerability exists in some types implementing `ILiteralType.ObjectToSQLString`. Callers of these methods are exposed to the vulnerability, which includes:
  - Mappings using inheritance with discriminator values:
  - The discriminator value could be written in the mapping in a way exploiting the vulnerability of the associated discriminator type, if that type is among the vulnerable ones.
  - The current culture settings for formatting the discriminator value type could be altered in a way resulting into SQL injections with the discriminator values.
  - HQL queries referencing a static field of the application.
  - Users of the `SqlInsertBuilder` and `SqlUpdateBuilder` utilities, calling their `AddColumn` overload taking a literal value. These overloads are unused by NHibernate but could be used by users referencing directly these utilities.
  - Any direct use of the `ObjectToSQLString` methods for building SQL queries on the user side.
