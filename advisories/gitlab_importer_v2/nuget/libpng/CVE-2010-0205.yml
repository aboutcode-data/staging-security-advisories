aliases:
  - CVE-2010-0205
summary: |
  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
  The png_decompress_chunk function in pngrutil.c in libpng  does not properly handle compressed ancillary-chunk data that has a disproportionately large uncompressed representation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption, and application hang) via a crafted PNG file, as demonstrated by use of the deflate compression method on data composed of many occurrences of the same character, related to a "decompression bomb" attack.
