  Path Traversal
  SharpCompress is a fully managed C# library to deal with many compression types and formats. SharpCompress has been found to be vulnerable to partial path traversal. SharpCompress recreates a hierarchy of directories under destinationDirectory if `ExtractFullPath` is set to true in options. In order to prevent extraction outside the destination directory the `destinationFileName` path is verified to begin with `fullDestinationDirectoryPath`. However, it is not enforced that `fullDestinationDirectoryPath` ends with slash. If the `destinationDirectory` is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. This issue is fixed in SharpCompress
