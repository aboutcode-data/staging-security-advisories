aliases:
  - CVE-2024-48924
  - GHSA-4qm4-8hg2-g2xm
summary: |
  MessagePack allows untrusted data to lead to DoS attack due to hash collisions and stack overflow
  When this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce hash collisions, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized.
