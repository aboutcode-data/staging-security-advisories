summary: "Imageflow affected by libwebp zero-day and should not be used with malicious source\
  \ images.\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability affects deployments of Imageflow that involve\
  \ decoding or processing malicious source .webp files. If you only process your own trusted\
  \ files, this should not affect you (but you should update anyway). \n\nImageflow relies on\
  \ Google's [libwebp] library to decode .webp images, and is affected by the recent zero-day\
  \ out-of-bounds write vulnerability [CVE-2023-4863](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863)\
  \ and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr. The libwebp vulnerability also affects\
  \ Chrome, Android, macOS, and other consumers of the library).\n\nlibwebp patched [the vulnerability](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/commit/2af26267cdfcb63a88e5c74a85927a12d6ca1d76\
  \ ) and released [1.3.2](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/releases/tag/v1.3.2) \n\n\
  This was patched in [libwebp-sys in 0.9.3 and 0.9.4](https://github.com/NoXF/libwebp-sys/commits/master)\n\
  \n**[Imageflow v2.0.0-preview8](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview8)\
  \ uses the patched version of libwebp as well as updated versions of all dependencies.**\n\
  \nNote: preview 8 requires libc 2.31 or higher on linux and macOS 11 or higher. These restrictions\
  \ are due to the oldest supported versions of those platforms (which is reflected on Github\
  \ Actions).\n\n### Patches\n\n**Imageflow v2.0.0-preview8 use the patched version (v1.3.2)\
  \ of libwebp and libwebp-sys 0.9.4.**\n**Imageflow.AllPlatforms 0.10.2 is patched**\n**Imageflow.Server\
  \ v0.8.2 is patched**\n**ImageResizer.Plugins.Imageflow 5.0.12 is patched**\n\n### Workarounds\n\
  \nDisable webp decoding using `EnabledCodecs::disable_decoder(NamedDecoders::WebPDecoder)`\
  \ if using the Rust API. \n\nOnly files that meet the following criteria will be passed to\
  \ libwebp: \n\n```rust\nbytes.starts_with(b\"RIFF\") && bytes[8..12].starts_with(b\"WEBP\"\
  )\n```\n\nYou can utilize matching logic to block webp inputs in your language of choice.\n\
