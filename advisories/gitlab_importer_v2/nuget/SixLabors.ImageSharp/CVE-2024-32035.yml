summary: |
  SixLabors.ImageSharp vulnerable to Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
  A vulnerability discovered in the ImageSharp library, where the processing of specially crafted files can lead to excessive memory usage in image decoders. The vulnerability is triggered when ImageSharp attempts to process image files that are designed to exploit this flaw.
