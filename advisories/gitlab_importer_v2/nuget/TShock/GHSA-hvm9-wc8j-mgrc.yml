  TShock Security Escalation Exploit
  An issue with the way OTAPI manages client connections results in stale UUIDs remaining on `RemoteClient` instances after a player disconnects.

  Because of this, if the following conditions are met a player may assume the login state of a previously connected player:
  1. The server has UUID login enabled
  2. An authenticated player disconnects
  3. A subsequent player connects with a modified client that does not send the `ClientUUID#68` packet during connection
  4. The server assigns the same `RemoteClient` object that belonged to the originally authenticated player to the newly connected player
