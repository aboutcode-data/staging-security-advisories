summary: |
  Command Injection in tree-kill
  Versions of `tree-kill` prior to 1.2.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize values passed to the  `kill` function. If this value is user-controlled it  may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server. The issue only affects Windows systems.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 1.2.2 or later.
