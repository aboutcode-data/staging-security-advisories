summary: |
  Trix has a cross-site Scripting vulnerability on copy & paste
  The Trix editor, versions prior to 2.1.4, is vulnerable to XSS when pasting malicious code. This vulnerability is a bypass of the fix put in place for https://github.com/basecamp/trix/security/advisories/GHSA-qjqp-xr96-cj99. In https://github.com/basecamp/trix/pull/1149, we added sanitation for Trix attachments with a `text/html` content type. However, Trix only checks the content type on the paste event's `dataTransfer` object. As long as the `dataTransfer` has a content type of `text/html`, Trix parses its contents and creates an `Attachment` with them, even if the attachment itself doesn't have a `text/html` content type. Trix then uses the attachment content to set the attachment element's `innerHTML`.
