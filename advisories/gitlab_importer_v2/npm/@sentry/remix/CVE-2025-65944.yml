summary: |
  Sentry's sensitive headers are leaked when `sendDefaultPii` is set to `true`
  In version 10.11.0, a change to how the SDK collects request data in Node.js applications caused certain incoming HTTP headers to be added as trace span attributes. When `sendDefaultPii: true` was set, a few headers that were previously redacted - including Authorization and Cookie - were unintentionally allowed through.

  Sentry’s server-side scrubbing (handled by Sentry's Relay edge proxy) normally serves as a second layer of protection. However, because it relied on the same matching logic as the SDK, it also failed to catch these headers in this case.

  Users may be impacted if:

  1. Their Sentry SDK configuration has `sendDefaultPii` set to `true`
  2. Their application uses one of the Node.js Sentry SDKs with version from `10.11.0` to `10.26.0` inclusively:
  - @sentry/astro
  - @sentry/aws-serverless
  - @sentry/bun
  - @sentry/google-cloud-serverless
  - @sentry/nestjs
  - @sentry/nextjs
  - @sentry/node
  - @sentry/node-core
  - @sentry/nuxt
  - @sentry/remix
  - @sentry/solidstart
  - @sentry/sveltekit

  Users can check if their project was affected, by visiting Explore → Traces and searching for “http.request.header.authorization”, “http.request.header.cookie” or similar. Any potentially sensitive values will be specific to users' applications and configurations.
