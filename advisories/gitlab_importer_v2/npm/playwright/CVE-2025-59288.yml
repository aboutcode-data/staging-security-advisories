aliases:
  - CVE-2025-59288
  - GHSA-7mvr-c777-76hp
summary: |
  Playwright downloads and installs browsers without verifying the authenticity of the SSL certificate
  Use of `curl` with the `-k` (or `--insecure`) flag in installer scripts allows attackers to deliver arbitrary executables via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This can lead to full system compromise, as the downloaded files are installed as privileged applications.
