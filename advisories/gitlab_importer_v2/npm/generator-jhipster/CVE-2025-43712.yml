  Withdrawn Advisory: JHipster allows privilege escalation via a modified authorities parameter
  ## Withdrawn Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because the original report was found to be invalid. This link is maintained to preserve external references. For more information, see https://groups.google.com/g/jhipster-dev/c/ATSlWkEjw2w.

  ## Original Description

  JHipster before v.8.9.0 allows privilege escalation via a modified authorities parameter. Upon registering in the JHipster portal and logging in as a standard user, the authorities parameter in the response from the api/account endpoint contains the value ROLE_USER. By manipulating the authorities parameter and changing its value to ROLE_ADMIN, the privilege is successfully escalated to an Admin level. This allowed the access to all admin-related functionalities in the application.
