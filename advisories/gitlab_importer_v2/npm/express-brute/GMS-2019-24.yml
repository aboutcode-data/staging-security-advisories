  Rate Limiting Bypass in express-brute
  All versions of `express-brute` are vulnerable to Rate Limiting Bypass. Concurrent requests may lead to race conditions that cause the package to incorrectly count requests. This may allow an attacker to bypass the rate limiting provided by the package and execute requests without limiting. No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.
