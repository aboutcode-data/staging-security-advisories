aliases:

  - GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4
summary: |
  form-data uses unsafe random function in form-data for choosing boundary
  form-data uses `Math.random()` to select a boundary value for multipart form-encoded data. This can lead to a security issue if an attacker:
  1. can observe other values produced by Math.random in the target application, and
  2. can control one field of a request made using form-data

  Because the values of Math.random() are pseudo-random and predictable (see: https://blog.securityevaluators.com/hacking-the-javascript-lottery-80cc437e3b7f), an attacker who can observe a few sequential values can determine the state of the PRNG and predict future values, includes those used to generate form-data's boundary value. The allows the attacker to craft a value that contains a boundary value, allowing them to inject additional parameters into the request.

  This is largely the same vulnerability as was [recently found in `undici`](https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312) by [`parrot409`](https://hackerone.com/parrot409?type=user) -- I'm not affiliated with that researcher but want to give credit where credit is due! My PoC is largely based on their work.
