summary: "@node-saml/node-saml's validatePostRequestAsync does not include checkTimestampsValidityError\n\
  ### Summary\n\nThe lack of checking of current timestamp allows a LogoutRequest XML to be\
  \ reused multiple times even when the current time is past the NotOnOrAfter. \n\n### Details\n\
  \nIt was noticed that in the validatePostRequestAsync() flow in saml.js, the current timestamp\
  \ is never checked. This could present a vulnerability where a user who has an XML LogoutRequest\
  \ could validated it if the IssueInstance and the NotOnOrAfter are valid along with valid\
  \ credentials (signature, certificate etc.). \n\n### PoC\n\nI was able to validate a sample\
  \ valid LogoutRequest XML multiple times through postman by sending it to my endpoint regardless\
  \ if the current present time was past the NotOnOrAfter time. After some further testing,\
  \ it seems that only the IssueInstance is checked against NotOnOrAfter. Not sure if this was\
  \ the intended behaviour but I believe having a never expiring valid LogoutRequest could be\
  \ dangerous.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis could impact the user where they would be logged out from\
  \ an expired LogoutRequest. In bigger contexts, if LogoutRequests are sent out in mass to\
  \ different SPs, this could impact many users on a large scale."
