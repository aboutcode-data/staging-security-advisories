summary: |
  Local File Inclusion vulnerability in zmarkdown
  A minor Local File Inclusion vulnerability has been found in
  `zmarkdown`, which allowed for images with a known path on
  the host machine to be included inside a LaTeX document.

  To prevent it, a new option has been created that allow to replace
  invalid paths with a default image instead of linking the image on the
  host directly. `zmarkdown` has been updated to make this setting the
  default.

  Every user of `zmarkdown` is likely impacted, except if
  disabling LaTeX generation or images download. Here
  is an example of including an image from an invalid path:

  ```markdown
  ![](/tmp/img.png)
  ```

  Will effectively redownload and include the image
  found at `/tmp/img.png`.
