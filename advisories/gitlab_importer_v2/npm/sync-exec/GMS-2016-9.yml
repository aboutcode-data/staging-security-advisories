summary: |
  Tmp files readable by other users
  The sync-exec module is used to simulate child_process.execSync in node Sync-exec uses tmp directories as a buffer before returning values. Other users on the server have read access to the tmp directory, possibly allowing an attacker on the server to obtain confidential information from the buffer/tmp file, while it exists.
