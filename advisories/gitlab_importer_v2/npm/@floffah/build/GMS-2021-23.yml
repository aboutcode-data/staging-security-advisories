summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') in @floffah/build
  ### Impact
  If you are using the esbuild target or command you are at risk of code/option injection. Attackers can use the command line option to maliciously change your settings in order to damage your project.

  ### Patches
  The problem has been patched in v1.0.0 as it uses a proper method to pass configs to esbuild/estrella.

  ### Workarounds
  There is no work around. You should update asap.

  ### Notes
  This notice is mainly just to make sure people update to the latest version. This isn't that bad, but should encourage you to update.
