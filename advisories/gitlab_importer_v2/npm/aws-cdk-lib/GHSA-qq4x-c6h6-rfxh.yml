  aws-cdk-lib has Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability when using Cognito UserPoolClient Construct
  The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure using code. Customers use it to create their own applications which are converted to AWS CloudFormation templates during deployment to a customer’s AWS account. CDK contains pre-built components called "[constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html)" that are higher-level abstractions providing defaults and best practices. This approach enables developers to use familiar programming languages to define complex cloud infrastructure more efficiently than writing raw CloudFormation templates.
