summary: "Incorrect Authorization\nAWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software\
  \ development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS\
  \ CloudFormation. In the packages `aws-cdk-lib` 2.0.0 until 2.80.0 and `@aws-cdk/aws-eks`\
  \ 1.57.0 until 1.202.0, `eks.Cluster` and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles,\
  \ `CreationRole` and `default MastersRole`, that have an overly permissive trust policy. \n\
  \ \nThe first, referred to as the `CreationRole`, is used by lambda handlers to create the\
  \ cluster and deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`, `HelmChart`, ...) onto\
  \ it. Users with CDK version higher or equal to 1.62.0 (including v2 users) may be affected.\n\
  \ \nThe second, referred to as the `default MastersRole`, is provisioned only if the `mastersRole`\
  \ property isn't provided and has permissions to execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster.\
  \ Users with CDK version higher or equal to 1.57.0 (including v2 users) may be affected.\n\
  \nThe issue has been fixed in `@aws-cdk/aws-eks` v1.202.0 and `aws-cdk-lib` v2.80.0. These\
  \ versions no longer use the account root principal. Instead, they restrict the trust policy\
  \ to the specific roles of lambda handlers that need it. There is no workaround available\
  \ for CreationRole. To avoid creating the `default MastersRole`, use the `mastersRole` property\
  \ to explicitly provide a role."
