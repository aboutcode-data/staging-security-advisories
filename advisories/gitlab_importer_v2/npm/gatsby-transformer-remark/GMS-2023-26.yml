summary: "gatsby-transformer-remark has possible unsanitized JavaScript code injection\n###\
  \ Impact\nThe gatsby-transformer-remark plugin prior to versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input\
  \ through to the `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in\
  \ its default configuration, unless input is sanitized. The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark\
  \ when passing input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL). Injected JavaScript\
  \ executes in the context of the build server.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized\
  \ input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark.\
  \ The following payload demonstrates a vulnerable configuration:\n```\n---js\n((require(\"\
  child_process\")).execSync(\"id >> /tmp/rce\"))\n--- \n```\n\n### Patches\nA patch has been\
  \ introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which\
  \ mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine. The patch\
  \ introduces a new option, `JSFrontmatterEngine` which is set to `false` by default. When\
  \ setting `JSFrontmatterEngine` to `true`, input passed to `gatsby-plugin-mdx` must be sanitized\
  \ before processing to avoid a security risk. Warnings are displayed when enabling `JSFrontmatterEngine`\
  \ to `true` or if it appears that the MarkdownRemark input is attempting to use the Frontmatter\
  \ engine.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an older version of `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used,\
  \ input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.\n\n**We encourage\
  \ projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure\
  \ the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.**\n\n\n### For\
