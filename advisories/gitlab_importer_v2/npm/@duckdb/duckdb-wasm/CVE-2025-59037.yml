summary: |
  DuckDB NPM packages 1.3.3 and 1.29.2 briefly compromised with malware
  The DuckDB distribution for [Node.js](http://node.js/) on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) was compromised with malware (along with [several other packages](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised)). An attacker published new versions of four of duckdb’s packages that included **malicious code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions**. The following packages and versions are affected:

  - `@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3`
  - `@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3`
  - `duckdb@1.3.3`
  - `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2`

  > Note: The current release version of DuckDB is 1.3.2, with 1.4.0 expected to be released on Sept 10th, 2025 (tomorrow as of this writing). We do not plan to ever release a “legit” DuckDB 1.3.3. Users should double-check that they are not accidentally updating to those affected versions.


  We have ourselves noticed this *within four hours* of it happening. Here’s our response:

  - As an immediate response, we have **deprecated** the specific versions.
  - We have reached out to npm support to **delete the affected versions**. They were so kind to do so.
  - We have also **re-released** the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0) as a further safeguard so the latest version of the package points to a safe version

  We apologize for this issue. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases.
