summary: |
  REC in MCPJam inspector due to HTTP Endpoint exposes
  MCPJam inspector is the local-first development platform for MCP servers. The Latest version Versions 1.4.2 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, which allows an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request that triggers the installation of an MCP server, leading to RCE.

  This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2025-49596, but more severe. While CVE-2025-49596 requires tricking a user into clicking a malicious link, this vulnerability is exploitable with no user interaction. Since MCPJam inspector by default listens on 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1, an attacker can trigger the RCE remotely via a simple HTTP request.
