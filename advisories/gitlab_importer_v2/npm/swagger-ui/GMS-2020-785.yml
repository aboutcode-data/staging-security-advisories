summary: |
  Cross-Site Scripting in swagger-ui
  Affected versions of `swagger-ui` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability exists because `swagger-ui` automatically executes external Javascript that is loaded in via the `url` query string parameter when a `Content-Type: application/javascript` header is included.

  An attacker can create a server that replies with a malicious script and the proper content-type, and then craft a `swagger-ui` URL that includes the location to their server/script in the `url` query string parameter. When viewed, such a link would execute the attacker's malicious script.


  ## Recommendation

  Update to 2.2.1 or later.
