summary: |
  Machine-In-The-Middle in https-proxy-agent
  Versions of `https-proxy-agent` prior to 2.2.3 are vulnerable to Machine-In-The-Middle. The package fails to enforce TLS on the socket if the proxy server responds the to the request with a HTTP status different than 200. This allows an attacker with access to the proxy server to intercept unencrypted communications, which may include sensitive information such as credentials.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 3.0.0 or 2.2.3.
