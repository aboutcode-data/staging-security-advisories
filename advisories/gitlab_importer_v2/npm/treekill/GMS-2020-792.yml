summary: |
  Command Injection in treekill
  All versions of `treekill` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize values passed to the  `kill` function. If this value is user-controlled it  may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server. The issue only affects Windows systems.


  ## Recommendation

  No fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.
