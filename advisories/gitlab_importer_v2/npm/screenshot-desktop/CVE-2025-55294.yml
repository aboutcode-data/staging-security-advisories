summary: |
  screenshot-desktop vulnerable to command Injection via `format` option
  This vulnerability is a **command injection** issue.
  When user-controlled input is passed into the `format` option of the screenshot function, it is interpolated into a shell command without sanitization.
  An attacker can craft malicious input such as:

  { format: "; echo vulnerable > /tmp/hello;" }

  This results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the calling process.

  **Who is impacted:**
  Any application that accepts untrusted input and forwards it directly (or indirectly) into the `format` option is affected. If the library is used in a server-side context (e.g., API endpoints, web services), attackers may be able to exploit this **remotely and without authentication**, leading to full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

  **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
