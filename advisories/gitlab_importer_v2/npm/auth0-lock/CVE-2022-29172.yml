summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
  Auth0 is an authentication broker that supports both social and enterprise identity providers, including Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, and Salesforce. In versions before `11.33.0`, when the â€œadditional signup fieldsâ€? feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property). Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the â€œadditional signup fieldsâ€? feature in your application. Upgrade to version `11.33.0`.
