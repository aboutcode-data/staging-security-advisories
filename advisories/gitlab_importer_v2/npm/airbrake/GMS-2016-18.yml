  Insecure Default Configuration
  The airbrake module defaults to sending environment variables over HTTP. Environment variables can often times contain secret keys and other sensitive values. A malicious user could be on the same network as a regular user and intercept all the secret keys the user is sending. This goes against common best practice, which is to use HTTPS.
