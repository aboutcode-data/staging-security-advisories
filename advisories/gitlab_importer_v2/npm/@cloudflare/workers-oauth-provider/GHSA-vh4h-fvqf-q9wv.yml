summary: "Duplicate Advisory: @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider PKCE bypass via downgrade attack\n\
  # Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-qgp8-v765-qxx9.\
  \ This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\nPKCE\
  \ was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP\
  \ framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp . However, it was found that an attacker\
  \ could cause the check to be skipped.\n\n\nFixed in:\n\n \n\n https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27\
  \ https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 \n\n\nImpact: \n\nPKCE is a\
  \ defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension\
  \ in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification\
  \ requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection."
