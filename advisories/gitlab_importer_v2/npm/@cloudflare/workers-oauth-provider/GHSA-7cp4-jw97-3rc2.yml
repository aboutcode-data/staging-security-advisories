summary: "Duplicate Advisory: @cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider missing validation of redirect_uri\
  \ on authorize endpoint\n# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it\
  \ is a duplicate of GHSA-4pc9-x2fx-p7vj. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\
  \n# Original Description\nThe OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part\
  \ of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate\
  \ that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.\n\
  \nFixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26\
  \ \n\nImpact:\n\n \n\nUnder certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously\
  \ authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick\
  \ the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the\
  \ victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.\n\nIn order\
  \ for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to\
  \ auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has\
  \ authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider;\
  \ it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization.\
  \ However, many applications do implement such logic.\n\nNote: It is a basic, well-known requirement\
  \ that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the\
  \ client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization\
  \ code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not\
  \ the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are\
  \ familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed\
  \ list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author\
  \ of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement,\
  \ thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually\
  \ make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing,\
  \ it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it."
