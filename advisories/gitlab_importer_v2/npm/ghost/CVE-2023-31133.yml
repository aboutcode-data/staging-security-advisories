summary: |
  Ghost vulnerable to information disclosure of private API fields
  ### Impact

  Due to a lack of validation when filtering on the public API endpoints, it is possible to reveal private fields via a brute force attack.

  Ghost(Pro) has already been patched. We can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added.

  Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version below v5.46.1. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site - see patches and workarounds below.

  ### Patches

  v5.46.1 contains a fix for this issue.

  ### Workarounds

  Add a block for requests to `/ghost/api/content/*` where the `filter` query parameter contains `password` or `email`.
