summary: "Remote command injection when using sendmail email transport\n### Impact\n\nSites\
  \ using the `sendmail` transport as part of their `mail` config are vulnerable to remote command\
  \ injection due to a [vulnerability](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-48ww-j4fc-435p) in\
  \ the `nodemailer` dependency.\n\nGhost defaults to the `direct` transport so this is only\
  \ exploitable if the `sendmail` transport is explicitly used.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in 4.15.0,\
  \ all sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Use an alternative\
  \ email transport as described in the [docs](https://ghost.org/docs/config/#mail). \n\n###\
  \ For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n*\
  \ email us at security@ghost.org"
