summary: |
  Wrangler affected by OS Command Injection in `wrangler pages deploy`
  **Summary**

  A command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) has been found to exist in the `wrangler pages deploy` command. The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.

  **Root cause**

  The `commitHash` variable, derived from user input via the `--commit-hash` CLI argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals (e.g., ``execSync(`git show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)``). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell, enabling command execution.

  **Impact**

  This vulnerability is generally hard to exploit, as it requires `--commit-hash` to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines and the `--commit-hash` parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted sources. An attacker could exploit this to:

  - Run any shell command.
  - Exfiltrate environment variables.
  - Compromise the CI runner to install backdoors or modify build artifacts.

  **Mitigation**

  - Wrangler v4 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v4.59.1 or higher.
  - Wrangler v3 users are requested to upgrade to Wrangler v3.114.17 or higher.
  - Users on Wrangler v2 (EOL) should upgrade to a supported major version.
