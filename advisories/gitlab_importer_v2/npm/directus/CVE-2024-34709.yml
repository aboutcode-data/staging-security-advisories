  Directus Lacks Session Tokens Invalidation
  Currently session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if you captured the cookie value it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be.
  When authenticating a session token JWT, Directus should also check whether the associated `directus_session` both still exists and has not expired (although the token should expire at the same time or before the session) to ensure leaked tokens are not valid indefinitely.
