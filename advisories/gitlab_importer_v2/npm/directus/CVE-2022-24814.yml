summary: |
  Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
  Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 9.7.0, unauthorized JavaScript (JS) can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS. This issue was resolved in version 9.7.0. As a workaround, disable the live embed in the what-you-see-is-what-you-get by adding `{ "media_live_embeds": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface.
