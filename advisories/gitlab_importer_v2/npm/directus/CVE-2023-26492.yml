summary: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus
  is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when importing a file from a remote web
  server (POST to `/files/import`). An attacker can bypass the security controls by performing
  a DNS rebinding attack and view sensitive data from internal servers or perform a local port
  scan. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access highly sensitive internal server(s)
  and steal sensitive information. This issue was fixed in version 9.23.0.
