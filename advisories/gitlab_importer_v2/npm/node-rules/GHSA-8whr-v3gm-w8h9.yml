  Duplicate Advisory: Command Injection in node-rules
  ## Duplicate Advisory
  This advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-f78f-353m-cf4j. This link is maintained to preserve external references.

  ## Original Description
  Versions of `node-rules` prior to 5.0.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input rules and passes it directly to an `eval` call when using the `fromJSON` function. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the rules are user-controlled.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 5.0.0 or later.
