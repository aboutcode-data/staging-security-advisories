summary: |
  Flowise Cloud and Local Deployments have Unauthenticated Password Reset Token Disclosure that Leads to Account Takeover
  The `forgot-password` endpoint in Flowise returns sensitive information including a valid password reset `tempToken` without authentication or verification. This enables any attacker to generate a reset token for arbitrary users and directly reset their password, leading to a complete **account takeover (ATO)**.

  This vulnerability applies to **both the cloud service (`cloud.flowiseai.com`) and self-hosted/local Flowise deployments** that expose the same API.

  **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** **9.8 (Critical)**
  **Vector String:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
