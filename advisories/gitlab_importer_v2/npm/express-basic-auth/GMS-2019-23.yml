  Timing Attack in express-basic-auth
  Versions of `express-basic-auth` are vulnerable to Timing Attacks. The package uses nating string comparison instead of a constant time string compare which may lead to Timing Attacks. Timing Attacks can be used to increase the efficiency of brute-force attacks by removing the exponential increase in entropy gained from longer secrets.
