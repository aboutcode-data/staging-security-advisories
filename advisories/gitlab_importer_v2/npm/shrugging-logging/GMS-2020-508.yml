summary: |
  Malicious Package
  All versions of `shrugging-logging` contain malicious code as a postinstall script. The package fetches all names of npm packages owned by the user and attempts to add another maintainer to every package as a means of package hijacking, ## Recommendation

  Remove the package from your system. If you own any packages that were compromised please contact npm security immediately at security@npmjs.com. Also enable 2FA for publishing to further secure packages you maintain.
