  ERC1155Supply vulnerability in OpenZeppelin Contracts
  When ERC1155 tokens are minted, a callback is invoked on the receiver of those tokens, as required by the spec. When including the `ERC1155Supply` extension, total supply is not updated until after the callback, thus during the callback the reported total supply is lower than the real number of tokens in circulation.

  ### Impact
  If a system relies on accurately reported supply, an attacker may be able to mint tokens and invoke that system after receiving the token balance but before the supply is updated.

  ### Patches
  A fix is included in version 4.3.3 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.

  ### Workarounds
  If accurate supply is relevant, do not mint tokens to untrusted receivers.

  ### Credits
  The issue was identified and reported by @ChainSecurityAudits.
