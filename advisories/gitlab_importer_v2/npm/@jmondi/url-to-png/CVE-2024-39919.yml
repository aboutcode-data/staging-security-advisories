summary: |
  @jmondi/url-to-png enables capture screenshot of localhost web services (unauthenticated pages)
  The maintainer been contemplating whether FTP or other protocols could serve as useful functionalities, but there may not be a practical reason for it since we are utilizing headless Chrome to capture screenshots. The argument is based on the assumption that this package can function as a service.

  The package includes an `ALLOW_LIST` where the host can specify which services the user is permitted to capture screenshots of. By default, capturing screenshots of web services running on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the [::] is allowed.

  The maintainer is of the opinion that the package should also have a denylist due to a potential vulnerability (or rather design oversight). If someone hosts this on a server, users could then capture screenshots of other web services running locally.

  Unless this is strictly for web pages. Something similar here: https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/issues/235 (localhost is intended for end users or hosts to deny, and the package is for HTTP/HTTPS.)

  This is marked as a `LOW` since the maintainer is not sure if this is a vulnerability, but it's still best to highlight it. :)
