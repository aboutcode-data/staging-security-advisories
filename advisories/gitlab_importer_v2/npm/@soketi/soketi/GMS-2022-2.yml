summary: |
  Denial of Service in soketi
  ### Impact
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  There was a wrong behavior when reading POST requests, making the server crash if it couldn't read the body. In case a POST request was sent to any endpoint of the server with an empty body, **even unauthenticated with the Pusher Protocol**, it would simply just crash the server for trying to send a response after the request closed.

  All users that run the server are affected by it and it's highly recommended to upgrade to the latest patch.

  ### Patches
  _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

  Updating to at least or the latest version.

  ### Workarounds
  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  No. Upgrading is the only solution.

  ### References
  _Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_

  https://github.com/soketi/soketi/releases/tag/0.24.1
