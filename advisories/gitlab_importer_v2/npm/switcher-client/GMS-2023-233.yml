summary: |
  Switcher Client contains Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
  ### Impact
  Unsanitized input flows into Strategy match operation (EXIST), where it is used to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack (reDOS).

  ### Patches
  Patched in 3.1.4

  ### Workarounds
  Avoid using Strategy settings that use REGEX in conjunction with EXIST and NOT_EXIST operations.
