  Insecure Defaults Allow MITM Over TLS
  There's a flaw in the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized` setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, certificate verification will be disabled. This is problematic as engine.io-client passes in an object for settings that includes the `rejectUnauthorized` property, whether it has been set or not. If the value has not been explicitly changed, it will be passed in as `null`, resulting in certificate verification being turned off.
