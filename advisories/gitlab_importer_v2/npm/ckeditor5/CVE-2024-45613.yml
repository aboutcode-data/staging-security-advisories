This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration.

  This vulnerability affects **only** installations where the editor configuration meets the following criteria:
