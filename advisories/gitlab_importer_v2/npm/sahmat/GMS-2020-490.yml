summary: "Prototype Pollution in sahmat\nAll versions of `sahmat ` are vulnerable to prototype\
  \ pollution. The package does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype, which\
  \ may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects.\
  \ \n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package\
  \ until a fix is made available."
