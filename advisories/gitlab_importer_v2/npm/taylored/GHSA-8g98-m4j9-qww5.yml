  Taylored webhook validation vulnerabilities
  A series of moderate to high-severity security vulnerabilities have been identified specifically in version **7.0.7 of \`taylored\`**. These vulnerabilities reside in the "Backend-in-a-Box" template distributed with this version. They could allow a malicious actor to read arbitrary files from the server, download paid patches without completing a valid purchase, and weaken the protection of encrypted patches.

  **All users who have installed or generated a \`taysell-server\` using version 7.0.7 of \`taylored\` are strongly advised to immediately upgrade to version 7.0.8 (or later) and follow the required mitigation steps outlined below.** Versions prior to 7.0.7 did not include the Taysell functionality and are therefore not affected by these specific issues.
