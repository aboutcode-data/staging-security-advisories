summary: "Cross-Site Scripting in bootstrap-tagsinput\nAll versions of `bootstrap-tagsinput`\
  \ are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when user input is passed into the `itemTitle` parameter\
  \ unmodified, as the package fails to properly sanitize or encode user input for that parameter.\n\
  \n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis package is not actively maintained, and has not seen an update\
  \ since 2015. \n\nBecause of this, the simplest mitigation is to avoid using the `itemTitle`\
  \ parameter. With over 200 open issues and over 100 open pull requests as of 2/2018, it seems\
  \ unlikely that the author has any intention of maintaining the module. If avoiding the use\
  \ of `itemTitle` indefinitely is acceptable, this is a workable solution. If not, the best\
  \ available mitigation is to use a fork of the module that is actively maintained and provides\
  \ similar functionality. There are [many such forks to choose from available on github.](https://github.com/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput/network/members)."
