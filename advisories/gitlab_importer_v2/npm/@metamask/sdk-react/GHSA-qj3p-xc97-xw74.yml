summary: "MetaMask SDK indirectly exposed via malicious debug@4.4.2 dependency\n### Who is affected?\n\
  This advisory only applies to developers who use MetaMask SDK in the browser and who, on Sept\
  \ 8th 2025 between 13:00–15:30 UTC, performed one of the following actions and then deployed\
  \ their application:\n- Installed MetaMask SDK into a project with a lockfile for the first\
  \ time\n- Installed MetaMask SDK in a project without a lockfile\n- Updated a lockfile to\
  \ pull in `debug@4.4.2` (e.g., via `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`)\n\n### What happened?\n\
  On Sept 8th, 2025 (13:00–15:30 UTC), a malicious version of the `debug` package (v4.4.2) was\
  \ published to npm. The injected code attempts to interfere with dApp-to-wallet communication\
  \ when executed in a browser context. \n\nWhile MetaMask SDK itself was not directly impacted,\
  \ projects installing the SDK during this window may have inadvertently pulled in the malicious\
  \ version of `debug`.\n\n### Mitigation\n- If your application was rebuilt and redeployed\
  \ after Sept 8th, 2025, 15:30 UTC, the malicious version of debug should no longer be present.\
  \ Please also verify that your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.) is not caching `debug@4.4.2`.\n\
  - If you have not yet deployed since performing one of the actions above, delete your `node_modules`\
  \ and reinstall dependencies before deploying.\n- If your application was deployed during\
  \ the attack window and has not been rebuilt since, perform a clean install of dependencies\
  \ and redeploy to ensure the malicious package is removed.\n\n### Resources\n[GitHub Advisory\
