summary: |
  convict vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
  * An attacker can inject attributes that are used in other components
  * An attacker can override existing attributes with ones that have incompatible type, which may lead to a crash.

  The main use case of Convict is for handling server-side configurations written by the admins owning the servers, and not random users. So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their own server. Still a situation can happen where an admin not knowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into writing the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.
