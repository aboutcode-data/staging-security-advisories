summary: |
  path-sanitizer allows bypassing the existing filters to achieve path-traversal vulnerability
  This is a POC for a path-sanitizer [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-sanitizer). The filters can be bypassed and can result in path traversal.

  Payload: `..=%5c` can be used to bypass this on CLI (along with other candidates). Something similar would likely work on web apps as well.
