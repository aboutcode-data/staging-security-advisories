summary: |
  Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Scratch scratch-vm loads extension URLs from untrusted `project.json` files with certain `_` characters, resulting in remote code execution because the URL content is treated as a script and is executed as a worker. The responsible code is `getExtensionIdForOpcode` in `serialization/sb3.js`. The use of `_` is incompatible with a protection mechanism in older versions, in which URLs were split and consequently deserialization attacks were prevented.
