summary: "Validation bypass vulnerability\nBack in min June a security vulnerability was reported\
  \ to the team, the reason for the slow response was due to ownership of some packages\nwas\
  \ locked and we wanted to be sure to update all packages before any disclosure was released.\n\
  \nThe issue is deemed being a Low severity vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ impacts users who rely on the for last digits of personnummer to be a _real_ personnummer.\
  \ \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue have been patched in all repositories. The following versions\
  \ should be updated to as soon as possible:\n\nC# \nD \nDart \nElixir \nGo \nJava \nJavaScript\
  \ \nKotl \nLua \nPHP \nPerl \nPython \nRuby \nRust \nScala \nSwift \n\nIf you are using any\
  \ of the earlier packages, please update to latest.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue arrieses\
  \ from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the last four digits of the\
  \ personnummer to be\n000, which is invalid. To mitigate this without upgrading, a check on\
  \ the last four digits can be made to make sure it's not\n000x.\n\n### For more information\n\
