  Cross-site Scripting
  Formstone is vulnerable to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by improper validation of user supplied input in the `upload-target.php` and `upload-chunked.php` files. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL to execute a script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site once the URL is clicked or visited. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials, force malware execution, user redirection and others.
