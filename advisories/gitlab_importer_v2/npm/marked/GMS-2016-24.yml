  Sanitization bypass using HTML Entities
  Due to the way that marked parses input, specifically HTML entities, it's possible to bypass marked's content injection protection (`sanitize: true`) to inject a `javascript:` URL. This flaw exists because `&#xNNanything;` gets parsed to what it could and leaves the rest behind, resulting in just `anything;` being left.
