  Denial of Service in handlebars
  Affected versions of `handlebars` are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The package's parser may be forced into an endless loop while processing specially-crafted templates. This may allow attackers to exhaust system resources leading to Denial of Service.


  ## Recommendation

  Upgrade to version 4.4.5 or later.
