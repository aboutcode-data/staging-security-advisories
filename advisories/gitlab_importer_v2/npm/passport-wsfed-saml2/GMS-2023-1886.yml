summary: "passport-wsfed-saml2 Signature Bypass vulnerability\n## Information\nPlease note that\
  \ this is not a new disclosure, and is previously reported in our [SECURITY-NOTICE.md](https://github.com/auth0/passport-wsfed-saml2/commit/520b9fc0bb4249ce83bec47e30153419f086ab70\n\
  ) which we removed in favor of github advisory. \n\n# Overview\n\nA vulnerability was found\
  \ in the validation of a SAML signature. The validation does not ensure that the \"Signature\"\
  \ tag is at the proper location inside an \"Assertion\" tag. This leads to a signature relocation\
  \ attack where the attacker can corrupt one field of data while maintaining the signature\
  \ valid. This could allow an authenticated attacker to \"remove\" one group from the assertion\
  \ or corrupt another field of an assertion.\n\n# Am I affected?\n\nYou are affected if you\
  \ are using the passport-wsfed-saml2 library to version < 3.0.10\n\n# How do I fix it?\n\n\
  You may fix this issue by upgrading passport-wsfed-saml2 library to version 3.0.10 or above.\
  \ \n\n# Will the fix impact my users?\n\nThis fix patches the library that your application\
  \ runs, but will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions."
