summary: |
  Next.js Allows a Denial of Service (DoS) with Server Actions
  A Denial of Service (DoS) attack allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution.

  _Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time._

  Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing.

  This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel.

  This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions.
