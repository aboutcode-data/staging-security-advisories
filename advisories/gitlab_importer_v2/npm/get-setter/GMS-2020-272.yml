summary: "Prototype Pollution in get-setter\nAll versions of `get-setter` are vulnerable to\
  \ prototype pollution. The function `set` does not restrict the modification of an Object's\
  \ prototype, which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist\
  \ on all objects. \n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package\
  \ until a fix is made available."
