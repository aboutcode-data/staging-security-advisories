summary: "Sensitive Data Exposure in pem\nVersions of `pem` expose sensitive data when the `readPkcs12`\
  \ is used. \n\nThe `readPkcs12` function reads the certificate and key data from a pkcs12\
  \ file using the encryption password. As part of this process it creates a globally readable\
  \ file with a filename of random 0-f characters in the temporary directory containing the\
  \ password which is then read by OpenSSL. The file containing the password is never cleaned\
  \ up after it is used giving access to the pkcs12 password to any other users with access\
  \ to read files from the system. \nUpdate to or later."
