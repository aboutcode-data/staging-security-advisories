  h3 v1 has Request Smuggling (TE.TE) issue
  I was digging into h3 v1 (specifically v1.15.4) and found a critical HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability.

  Basically, `readRawBody` is doing a strict case-sensitive check for the Transfer-Encoding header. It explicitly looks for "chunked", but per the RFC, this header should be case-insensitive.

  **The Bug**: If I send a request with Transfer-Encoding: ChuNked (mixed case), h3 misses it. Since it doesn't see "chunked" and there's no Content-Length, it assumes the body is empty and processes the request immediately.

  This leaves the actual body sitting on the socket, which triggers a classic TE.TE Desync (Request Smuggling) if the app is running behind a Layer 4 proxy or anything that doesn't normalize headers (like AWS NLB or Node proxies).

  **Vulnerable Code** (`src/utils/body.ts`):

  ```js
  if (
  !Number.parseInt(event.node.req.headers["content-length"] || "") &&
  !String(event.node.req.headers["transfer-encoding"] ?? "")
  .split(",")
  .map((e) => e.trim())
  .filter(Boolean)
  .includes("chunked") // <--- This is the issue. "ChuNkEd" returns false here.
  ) {
  return Promise.resolve(undefined);
  }
  ```

  I verified this locally:

  - Sent a `Transfer-Encoding: ChunKed` request without a closing 0 chunk.
  - Express hangs (correctly waiting for data).
  - h3 responds immediately (vulnerable, thinks body is length 0).

  **Impact**: Since H3/Nuxt/Nitro is often used in containerized setups behind TCP load balancers, an attacker can use this to smuggle requests past WAFs or desynchronize the socket to poison other users' connections.

  **Fix**: Just need to normalize the header value before checking: ` .map((e) => e.trim().toLowerCase())`
