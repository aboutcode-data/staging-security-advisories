summary: "@keystone-6/core's bundled cuid package known to be insecure\n### Summary\nThe `cuid`\
  \ package used by `@keystone-6/*` and upstream dependencies is deprecated and [marked as insecure\
  \ by the author](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid#status-deprecated-due-to-security-use-cuid2-instead).\
  \ \n\nAs reported by the author\n> Cuid and other k-sortable and non-cryptographic ids (Ulid,\
  \ ObjectId, KSUID, all UUIDs) are all insecure. Use @paralleldrive/cuid2 instead.\n\n### What\
  \ are doing about this?\n- [We are waiting on Prisma](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/8282)\
  \ to add support for [`cuid2`](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2)\n- Alternatively, we\
  \ might default to a random string ourselves\n\n### What can I do about this?\nWe have added\
  \ a work-around for users who want to provide custom identifiers in https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8645\n\
  \n### What if I need a `cuid`?\nThe features marked as a security vulnerability by @paralleldrive\
  \ are sometimes actually needed ([as written in the README of `cuid`](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid#motivation))\
  \ - the problem is the inherent risks that features like this can have.\n\nYou might actually\
  \ want the features of a monotonically increasing (auto-increment, k-sortable), and timestamp-based\
  \ id as part of your application, and keystone should support that - but you might not want\
  \ them by _default_.\nThis is why this security advisory has been accepted by me (@dcousens),\
  \ we currently use cuid identifiers by default, and that should change.\n\n### Impact\nI have\
  \ accepted this security advisory on the basis that we don't need this kind of identifier\
  \ typically, and the need for them should be driven by an application's requirements, not\
  \ a convenient default."
