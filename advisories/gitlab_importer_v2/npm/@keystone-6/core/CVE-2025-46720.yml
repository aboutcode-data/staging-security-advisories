aliases:
  - CVE-2025-46720
  - GHSA-hg9m-67mm-7pg3
summary: |
  Keystone has an unintended `isFilterable` bypass that can be used as an oracle to match hidden fields
  `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields.

  Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result.
