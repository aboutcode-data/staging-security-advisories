summary: |
  Kottster app reinitialization can be re-triggered allowing command injection in development mode
  **Development mode only**. Kottster contains a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability when running in development mode.

  The vulnerability combines two issues:
  1. The `initApp` action can be called repeatedly without checking if the app is already initialized, allowing attackers to create a new root admin account and obtain a JWT token
  2. The `installPackagesForDataSource` action uses unescaped command arguments, enabling command injection

  An attacker with access to a locally running development instance can chain these vulnerabilities to:
  - Reinitialize the application and receive a JWT token for a new root account
  - Use this token to authenticate
  - Execute arbitrary system commands through `installPackagesForDataSource`

  **Production deployments were never affected.**
