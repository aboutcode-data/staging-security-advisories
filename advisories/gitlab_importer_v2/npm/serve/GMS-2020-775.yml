summary: "Byass due to validation before canonicalization in serve\nVersions of `serve` before\
  \ 6.5.2 are vulnerable to the bypass of the ignore functionality. The bypass is possible because\
  \ validation happens before canonicalization of paths and filenames.\n\n\n\nExample:\nHere\
  \ we have a server that ignores the file test.txt.\n```\nconst serve = require('serve')\n\
  const server = serve(__dirname, {\n      port: 1337,\n      ignore: ['test.txt']\n})\n```\n\
  \nUsing the URL encoded form of a letter (%65 instead of e) attacker can bypass the ignore\
  \ control accessing the file. \n\n`curl http://localhost:1337/t%65st.txt`\n\nAdditionally\
  \ this technique can be used to get directory listings of ignored directories.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
  \nUpdate to version 6.5.2 or later."
