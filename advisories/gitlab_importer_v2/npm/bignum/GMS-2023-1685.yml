  Malware in pre-build binaries of bignum
  ### Impact

  bignum releases from v0.12.2 to v0.13.0 (inclusive) used node-pre-gyp to optionally download pre-built binary versions of the addon. These binaries were published on a now-expired S3 bucket which has since been claimed by a malicious third party which is now serving binaries containing malware that exfiltrates data from the user's computer.

  ### Patches

  v0.13.1 does not use node-pre-gyp and does not have support for downloading pre-built binaries in any form, avoiding the risk of malicious downloads.
