summary: |
  Claude Code permission deny bypass through symlink
  Claude Code failed to account for symlinks when checking permission deny rules. If a user explicitly denied Claude Code access to a file and Claude Code had access to a symlink pointing to that file, it was possible for Claude Code to access the file.

  Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.
