  - CVE-2025-59536
  - GHSA-4fgq-fpq9-mr3g
summary: |
  Claude Code can execute commands prior to the startup trust dialog
  Due to a bug in the startup trust dialog implementation, Claude Code could be tricked to execute code contained in a project before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this requires a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory.

  Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.
