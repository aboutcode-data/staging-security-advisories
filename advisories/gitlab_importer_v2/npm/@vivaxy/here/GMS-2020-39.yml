summary: "Directory Traversal in @vivaxy/here\nThe @vivaxy/here module is a small web server\
  \ that serves files with the process' working directory acting as the web root.\n\nIt is vulnerable\
  \ to a directory traversal attack. \n\nThis means that files on the local file system which\
  \ exist outside of the web root may be disclosed to an attacker. This might include confidential\
  \ files.\n\nMitigating Factors:\nIf the node process is run as a user with very limited filesystem\
  \ permissions, there is significantly less risk of exposing confidential/private information.\
  \ Proof of Concept:\n```\ncurl \"http://${SERVER_IP}:${SERVER_PORT}/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd\"\
  \n``` ## Recommendation\n\nRun `npm i @vivaxy/here` to install the latest version that addresses\
  \ this vulnerability."
