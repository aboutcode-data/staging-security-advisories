summary: |
  Microsoft Playwright MCP Server vulnerable to DNS Rebinding Attack; Allows Attackers Access to All Server Tools
  Microsoft Playwright MCP Server versions prior to 0.0.40 fails to validate the Origin header on incoming connections. This allows an attacker to perform a DNS rebinding attack via a victim’s web browser and send unauthorized requests to a locally running MCP server, resulting in unintended invocation of MCP tool endpoints.
