summary: "C5 Firefly III CSV Injection.\n### Summary\nCSV injection is a vulnerability where\
  \ untrusted user input in CSV files can lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation.\
  \ \nIn my subsequent testing of the application.\n\n### Details\nI discovered that there is\
  \ an option to \"Export Data\" from the web app to your personal computer, which exports a\
  \ \"csv\" file that can be opened with Excel software that supports macros.\n\nP.S \nI discovered\
  \ that the web application's is offering a demo-site that anyone may access to play with the\
  \ web application. So, there's a chance that someone will export the data (CVS) from the demo\
  \ site and execute it on their PC, giving the malicious actor a complete control over their\
  \ machine. (if a user enters a malicious payload to the website).\n\n### PoC\nYou can check\
  \ out my vulnerability report if you need more details/PoC with screenshots: (removed by JC5)\n\
  \n### Impact\nAn attacker can exploit this by entering a specially crafted payload to one\
  \ of the fields, and when a user export the csv file using the \"Export Data\" function, the\
  \ attacker can potentiality can RCE.\n\n### Addendum by JC5, the developer of Firefly III\n\
  There is zero impact on normal users, even on vulnerable versions."
