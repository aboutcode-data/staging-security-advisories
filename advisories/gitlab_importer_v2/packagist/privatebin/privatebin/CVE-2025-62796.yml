  PrivateBin is missing HTML sanitization of attached filename in file size hint
  We’ve identified an HTML injection/XSS vulnerability in PrivateBin service that allows the injection of arbitrary HTML markup via the attached filename. Below are the technical details, PoC, reproduction steps, impact, and mitigation recommendations.

  **Recommend action:** As the vulnerability has been fixed in the latest version, users are **strongly encouraged** to upgrade PrivateBin to the latest version _and_ [check](https://privatebin.info/directory/check) that a strong CSP header, just as the default suggested one, is delivered.

  **Summary of the vulnerability:** The `attachment_name` field containing the attached file name is included in the object that the client encrypts and is eventually rendered in the DOM without proper escaping.
