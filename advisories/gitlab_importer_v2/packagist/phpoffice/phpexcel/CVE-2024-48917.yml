summary: |
  XXE in PHPSpreadsheet's XLSX reader
  The `XmlScanner` class has a `scan` method which should prevent XXE attacks.

  However, we found another bypass than the previously reported `CVE-2024-47873`, the regexes from the `findCharSet` method, which is used for determining the current encoding can be bypassed by using a payload in the encoding UTF-7, and adding at end of the file a comment with the value `encoding="UTF-8"` with `"`, which is matched by the first regex, so that `encoding='UTF-7'` with single quotes `'` in the XML header is not matched by the second regex:

  ```
  $patterns = [
  '/encoding\\s*=\\s*"([^"]*]?)"/',
  "/encoding\\s*=\\s*'([^']*?)'/",
  ];
  ```

  A payload for the `workbook.xml` file can for example be created with CyberChef.
  If you open an Excel file containing the payload from the link above stored in the `workbook.xml` file with PhpSpreadsheet, you will receive an HTTP request on `127.0.0.1:12345`. You can test that an HTTP request is created by running the `nc -nlvp 12345` command before opening the file containing the payload with PhpSpreadsheet.

  To create the payload you need:
  1. Create a file containing `<?xml version = "1.0" encoding='UTF-7'` in an XML file
  2. Use the link attached above to create your XXE payload and add it to the XML file.
  3. Add `+ADw-+ACE---encoding="UTF-8"--+AD4-` to the end of the XML file, which is matched by the first regex.
