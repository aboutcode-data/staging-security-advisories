summary: |
  XXE in PHPSpreadsheet's XLSX reader
  The XmlScanner class has a scan method which should prevent XXE attacks. However, we found another bypass than the previously reported CVE-2024-47873, the regexes from the findCharSet method, which is used for determining the current encoding can be bypassed by using a payload in the encoding UTF-7, and adding at end of the file a comment with the value encoding="UTF-8" with ", which is matched by the first regex, so that encoding='UTF-7' with single quotes ' in the XML header is not matched by the second regex
