summary: "PHPECC vulnerable to multiple cryptographic side-channel attacks\n### ECDSA Canonicalization\n\
  \nPHPECC is vulnerable to malleable ECDSA signature attacks. \n\n### Constant-Time Signer\n\
  \nWhen generating a new ECDSA signature, the GMPMath adapter was used. This class wraps the\
  \ GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic library (GMP), which does not aim to provide constant-time\
  \ implementations of algorithms.\n\nAn attacker capable of triggering many signatures and\
  \ studying the time it takes to perform each operation would be able to leak the secret number,\
  \ `k`, and thereby learn the private key.\n\n### EcDH Timing Leaks\n\nWhen calculating a shared\
  \ secret using the `EcDH` class, the scalar-point multiplication is based on the arithmetic\
  \ defined by the `Point` class.\n\nEven though the library implements a Montgomery ladder,\
  \ the `add()`, `mul()`, and `getDouble()` methods on the `Point` class are not constant-time.\
  \ This means that your ECDH private keys are leaking information about each bit of your private\
  \ key through a timing side-channel."
