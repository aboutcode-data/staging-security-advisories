summary: |
  Potentially sensitive data exposure in Symfony Web Socket Bundle
  ### Impact
  Inside `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Server\App\Dispatcher\TopicDispatcher::onPublish()`, messages are arbitrarily broadcasted to the related Topic if `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Server\App\Dispatcher\TopicDispatcher::dispatch()` does not succeed.  The `dispatch()` method can be considered to not succeed if (depending on the version of the bundle) the callback defined on a topic route is misconfigured, a `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Topic\TopicInterface` implementation is not found for the callback, a topic which also implements `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Topic\SecuredTopicInterface` rejects the connection, or an Exception is unhandled.  This can result in an unintended broadcast to the websocket server potentially with data that should be considered sensitive.

  ### Patches
  In 1.10.4, 2.6.1, and 3.3.0, `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Server\App\Dispatcher\TopicDispatcher::onPublish()` has been changed to no longer broadcast an event's data if `Gos\Bundle\WebSocketBundle\Server\App\Dispatcher\TopicDispatcher::dispatch()` fails.

  ### Workarounds
  Upgrade to 1.10.4, 2.6.1, and 3.3.0

  Note, the 1.x branch is considered end of support as of July 1, 2020.
