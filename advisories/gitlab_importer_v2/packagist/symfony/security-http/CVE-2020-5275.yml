summary: |
  Incorrect Authorization
  In symfony/security-http, when a `Firewall` checks access control rule, it iterates overs each rule's attributes and stops as soon as the `accessDecisionManager` decides to grant access on the attribute, preventing the check of next attributes that should have been take into account in a unanimous strategy. The `accessDecisionManager` is now called with all attributes at once, allowing the unanimous strategy being applied on each attribute.
