summary: |
  Improper Cross-boundary Removal of Sensitive Data
  In Symfony, the `CachingHttpClient` class from the HttpClient Symfony component relies on the `HttpCache` class to handle requests. HttpCache uses internal headers like `X-Body-Eval` and `X-Body-File` to control the restoration of cached responses. The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by CachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the response for a request being made by the CachingHttpClient, remote code execution is possible.
