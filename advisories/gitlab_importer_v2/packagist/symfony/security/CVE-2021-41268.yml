summary: |
  Session Fixation
  `Symfony/SecurityBundle` is the security system for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Since the rework of the Remember me cookie, the cookie is not invalidated when the user changes their password. Attackers can therefore maintain their access to the account even if the password is changed as long as they have had the chance to login once and get a valid remember me cookie. Starting with, Symfony makes the password part of the signature by default. In that way, when the password changes, then the cookie is not valid anymore.
