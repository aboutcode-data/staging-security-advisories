summary: |
  FPDI allows Memory Exhaustion (OOM) in PDF Parser which leads to Denial of Service
  This is a significant Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Any application that uses FPDI to process
  user-supplied PDF files is at risk. An attacker can upload a small, malicious PDF file that will cause
  the server-side script to crash due to memory exhaustion. Repeated attacks can lead to sustained
  service unavailability.
