summary: |
  PrestaShop module ps_facetedsearch might be vulnerable from CVE-2017-9841
  ### Impact

  We have identified that some ps_facetedsearch module ZIP archives have been built with phpunit dev dependencies. PHPUnit contains a php script that would allow, on a webserver, an attacker to perform a RCE.

  This vulnerability impacts
  - phpunit before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3 as reported in [CVE-2017-9841](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9841)
  - phpunit >= 5.63 before 7.5.19 and 8.5.1 (this is a newly found vulnerability that is currently being submitted as a CVE after disclosure was provided to phpunit maintainers)

  ### Patches

  In the [security patch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_facetedsearch/releases/tag/v3.4.1), we look for the unwanted vendor/phpunit folder and remove it if we find it. This allows users to fix the security issue when upgrading.

  ### Workarounds
  Users can also simply remove the unwanted vendor/phpunit folder.
