summary: |
  Craft CMS vulnerable to potential authenticated Remote Code Execution via Twig SSTI
  For this to work, users must have administrator access to the Craft Control Panel, and [allowAdminChanges](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/reference/config/general.html#allowadminchanges) must be enabled for this to work, which is against Craft CMS' recommendations for any non-dev environment.

  https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/securing-craft#set-allowAdminChanges-to-false-in-production

  Alternatively, a non-administrator account with allowAdminChanges disabled can be used, provided access to the System Messages utility is available.

  It is possible to craft a malicious payload using the Twig `map` filter in text fields that accept Twig input under Settings in the Craft control panel or using the System Messages utility, which could lead to a RCE.

  Users should update to the patched versions (5.8.21 and 4.16.17) to mitigate the issue.
