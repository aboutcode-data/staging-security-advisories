summary: |
  UnoPim has Broken Access Control
  In Unopim, it is possible to create roles and choose the privileges. However, users without the “Delete” privilege for Products cannot delete a single product via the standard endpoint (expected behavior), but can still delete products via the mass-delete endpoint, even when the request contains only one product ID.
