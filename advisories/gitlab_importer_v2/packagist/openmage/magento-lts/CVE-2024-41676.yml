summary: |
  Magento LTS vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in admin system configs
  This XSS vulnerability is about the system configs
  * design/header/welcome
  * design/header/logo_src
  * design/header/logo_src_small
  * design/header/logo_alt

  They are intended to enable admins to set a text in the two cases, and to define an image url for the other two cases.
  But because of previously missing escaping allowed to input arbitrary html and as a consequence also arbitrary JavaScript.

  While this is in most usage scenarios not a relevant issue, some people work with more restrictive roles in the backend. Here the ability to inject JavaScript with these settings would be an unintended and unwanted privilege.
