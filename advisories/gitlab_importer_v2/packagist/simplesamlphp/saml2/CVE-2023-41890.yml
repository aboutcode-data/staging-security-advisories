summary: "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\nSustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support\
  \ to ASP.NET web sites, allowing the web site to act as a SAML2 Service Provider. \nPrior\
  \ to versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2, when a response is processed, the issuer of the Identity Provider\
  \ is not sufficiently validated. This could allow a malicious identity provider to craft a\
  \ Saml2 response that is processed as if issued by another identity provider. It is also possible\
  \ for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for one identity provider to be\
  \ used when processing the response from another provider. An application is impacted if they\
  \ rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization logic: the issuer of\
  \ the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request state (AuthenticationProperties).\
  \ This issue is patched in versions 2.9.2 and 1.0.3. The `AcsCommandResultCreated` notification\
  \ can be used to add the validation required if an upgrade to patched packages is not possible."
