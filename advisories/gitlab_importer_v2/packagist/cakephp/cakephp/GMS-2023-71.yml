  CakePHP vulnerable to Denial of Service attack through XML payloads
  RequestHandlerComponent had a vulnerability that would allow well crafted requests to create a denial of service attack. RequestHandlerComponent leverages `Xml::build()` which allows reading local files. We recommend that all applications using RequestHandlerComponent upgrade, or disable parsing XML payloads.
