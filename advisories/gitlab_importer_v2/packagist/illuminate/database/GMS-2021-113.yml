summary: |
  SQL Server LIMIT / OFFSET SQL Injection in laravel/framework and illuminate/database
  ### Impact

  Those using SQL Server with Laravel and allowing user input to be passed directly to the `limit` and `offset` functions is vulnerable to SQL injection. Other database drivers such as MySQL and Postgres are not affected by this vulnerability.

  ### Patches

  This problem has been patched on Laravel versions 6.20.26, 7.30.5, and 8.40.0.

  ### Workarounds

  You may workaround this vulnerability by ensuring that only integers are passed to the `limit` and `offset` functions, as well as the `skip` and `take` functions.
