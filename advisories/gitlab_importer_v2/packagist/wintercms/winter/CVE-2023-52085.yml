summary: |
  Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
  Winter is a free, open-source content management system. Users with access to backend forms that include a ColorPicker FormWidget can provide a value that would then be included without further processing in the compilation of custom stylesheets via LESS. This had the potential to lead to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability. This issue has been patched in v1.2.4.
