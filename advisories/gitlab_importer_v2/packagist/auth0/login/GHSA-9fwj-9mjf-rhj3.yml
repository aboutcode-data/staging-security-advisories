  laravel-auth0 SDK Vulnerable to Brute Force Authentication Tags of CookieStore Sessions
  **Overview**
  Session cookies of applications using the laravel-auth0 SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access.

  **Am I Affected?**
  You are affected by this vulnerability if you meet the following pre-conditions:
  1. Applications using laravel-auth0 SDK with version <=7.16.0
  2. laravel-auth0 SDK uses the Auth0-PHP SDK with version 8.0.0-BETA1 or higher and below 8.14.0.
  3. Session storage configured with CookieStore.

  **Fix**
  Upgrade Auth0/laravel-auth0 to v7.17.0. As an additional precautionary measure, we recommend rotating your cookie encryption keys. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected.

  **Acknowledgement**
  Okta would like to thank Félix Charette for discovering this vulnerability.
