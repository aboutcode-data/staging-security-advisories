summary: |
  league/commonmark's quadratic complexity bugs may lead to a denial of service
  Several polynomial time complexity issues in league/commonmark may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.

  Malicious users could trigger that inefficient code with carefully crafted Markdown inputs that are specifically designed to ensure the worst-case performance is reached.  Sending multiple such requests in parallel could tie up all available CPU resources and/or PHP-FPM processes, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.
