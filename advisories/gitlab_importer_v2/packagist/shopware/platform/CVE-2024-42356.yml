summary: |
  Shopware vulnerable to Server Side Template Injection in Twig using Context functions
  The `context` variable is injected into almost any Twig Template and allows to access to current language, currency information. The context object allows also to switch for a short time the scope of the Context as a helper with a callable function.

  Example call from PHP:

  ```php
  $context->scope(Context::SYSTEM_SCOPE, static function (Context $context) use ($mediaService, $media, &$fileBlob): void {
  $fileBlob = $mediaService->loadFile($media->getId(), $context);
  });
  ```

  This function can be called also from Twig and as the second parameter allows any callable, it's possible to call from Twig any statically callable PHP function/method.

  It's not possible as customer to provide any Twig code, the attacker would require access to Administration to exploit it using Mail templates or using App Scripts.
