  - CVE-2023-6551
  - GHSA-v6f4-jwv9-682w
summary: "Improper Input Validation\nAs a simple library, class.upload.php does not perform\
  \ an in-depth check on uploaded files, allowing a stored XSS vulnerability when the default\
  \ configuration is used. \n\n\nDevelopers must be aware of that fact and use extension allow\
  \ listing accompanied by forcing the server to always provide content-type based on the file\
  \ extension. \n\n\nThe README has been updated to include these guidelines."
