summary: |
  Pterodactyl does not revoke SFTP access when server is deleted or permissions reduced
  Pterodactyl does not revoke _active_ SFTP connections when a user is removed from a server instance or has their permissions changes with respect to file access over SFTP. This allows a user that was already connected to SFTP to remain connected and access files even after their permissions are revoked.
