  Drupal core Open Redirect vulnerability
  Drupal 7 has an Open Redirect vulnerability. For example, a user could be tricked into visiting a specially crafted link which would redirect them to an arbitrary external URL.

  The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the destination query parameter in the drupal_goto() function.

  Other versions of Drupal core are not vulnerable.
