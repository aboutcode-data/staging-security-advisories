  TYPO3 SQL Injection in dbal
  A flaw in the database escaping API results in a SQL injection vulnerability when extension dbal is enabled and configured for MySQL passthrough mode in its extension configuration. All queries which use the DatabaseConnection::sql_query are vulnerable, even if arguments were properly escaped with DatabaseConnection::quoteStr beforehand.
