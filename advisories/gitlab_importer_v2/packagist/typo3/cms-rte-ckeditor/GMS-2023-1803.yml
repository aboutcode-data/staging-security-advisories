summary: "Cross-Site Scripting in CKEditor4 WordCount Plugin\n> ### CVSS: `.4) \n\n### Problem\n\
  The [WordCount](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wordcount) plugin ([`npm:ckeditor-wordcount-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor-wordcount-plugin))\
  \ for CKEditor4 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when switching to the source code mode.\
  \ This plugin is enabled via the `Full.yaml` configuration present, but is not active in the\
  \ default configuration.\n\nIn default scenarios, exploiting this vulnerability requires a\
  \ valid backend user account. However, if custom plugins are used on the website frontend,\
  \ which accept and reflect rich-text content submitted by users, no authentication is required.\n\
  \n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30 that fix the problem\
  \ described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Sybille Peters who reported this issue, and to\
  \ TYPO3 core & security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n\
