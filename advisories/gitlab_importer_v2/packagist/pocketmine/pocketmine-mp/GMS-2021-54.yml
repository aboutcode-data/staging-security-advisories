summary: |
  Inability to de-op players if listed in ops.txt with non-lowercase letters
  ### Impact
  Originally reported in iTXTech/Genisys#1188

  ```txt
  PotterHarry98
  potterharry98
  ```

  `deop PotterHarry98`

  will remove `potterharry98` from the ops.txt but not `PotterHarry98`.

  Operator permissions are checked using `Config->exists()` with `lowercase=true`, which will result in a match:

  This means that it's possible to make yourself impossible to de-op (using commands) by adding your name to ops.txt with uppercase letters.

  ### Patches
  4d37b79ff7f9d9452e988387f97919a9a1c4954e

  ### Workarounds
  This can be easily addressed by removing the offending lines from ops.txt manually.
