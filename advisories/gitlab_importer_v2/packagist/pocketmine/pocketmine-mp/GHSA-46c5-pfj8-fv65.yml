summary: |
  Improperly checked metadata on tools/armour itemstacks received from the client
  Due to a workaround applied in 1.13, an attacker may send a negative damage/meta value in a tool or armour item's NBT, which `TypeConverter` then blindly uses as if it was valid without being checked.

  When this invalid metadata value reaches `Durable->setDamage()`, an exception is thrown because the metadata is not within the expected range for damage values.

  This can be reproduced with either a too-large damage value, or a negative one.
