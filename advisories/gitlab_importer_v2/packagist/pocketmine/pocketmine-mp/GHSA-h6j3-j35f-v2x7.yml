summary: |
  PocketMine-MP server crash with certain invalid JSON payloads in `LoginPacket` due to dependency vulnerability (3rd time)
  ### Impact
  An attacker could crash the server by sending malformed JWT JSON in LoginPacket due to a security vulnerability in [netresearch/jsonmapper](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper), due to attempting to construct objects from scalar types by default without any validation, with unexpected results that caused PocketMine-MP to crash.

  Due to the relatively high number of security issues arising from this specific dependency, the team is exploring options to replace it.

  ### Patches
  In the meantime, the issue was fixed by pmmp/netresearch-jsonmapper@b96a209f9e8b76b899a0d0918493cd87eb3c02a7 and 6872661fd03649cc7a8762c41c16e9ee5a4de1c9.

  ### Workarounds
  Detecting the malicious data that triggers this issue is of rather high difficulty, so it's not likely that a plugin would be able to easily remediate this.
