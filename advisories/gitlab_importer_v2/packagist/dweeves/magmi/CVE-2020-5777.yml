summary: |
  Improper Authentication
  MAGMI is vulnerable to a remote authentication bypass due to allowing default credentials in the event there is a database connection failure. A remote attacker can trigger this connection failure if the Mysql setting `max_connections` where the default is and is lower than Apache (or another web server) setting for `MaxRequestWorkers`, formerly `MaxClients`, where the default is This can be done by sending at least simultaneous requests to the Magento website to trigger a `Too many connections` error, then use default `magmi:magmi` basic authentication to remotely bypass authentication.
