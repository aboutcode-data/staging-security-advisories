summary: |
  Mautic does not shield .env files from web traffic
  This advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where sensitive `.env` configuration files may be directly accessible via a web browser. This exposure could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including database credentials, API keys, and other critical system configurations.

  Sensitive Information Disclosure via `.env` File Exposure: The `.env` file, which typically contains environment variables and sensitive application configurations, is directly accessible via a web browser due to missing web server configurations that restrict access to such files. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to view the contents of this file by simply navigating to its URL.
