summary: |
  Freeform Craft Plugin CP UI (builder/integrations) has Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue
  **Summary**
  An authenticated, low-privilege user (able to create/edit forms) can inject arbitrary HTML/JS into the Craft Control Panel (CP) builder and integrations views. User-controlled form labels and integration metadata are rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization, leading to stored XSS that executes when any admin views the builder/integration screens.

  **Affected Product**
  - Ecosystem: Packagist (Craft CMS plugin)
  - Package: solspace/craft-freeform
  - Version: <= 5.14.6 (latest observed). Likely all 5.x until patched.
