summary: |
  Cross-site Scripting
  A Stored XSS in YOOtheme Pagekit allows a user to upload malicious code via the picture upload feature. A user with elevated privileges could upload a photo to the system in an SVG format. This file will be uploaded to the system and it will not be stripped or filtered. The user can create a link on the website pointing to `/storage/poc.svg` that will point to `http://localhost/pagekit/storage/poc.svg.` When a user comes along to click that link, it will trigger a XSS attack.
