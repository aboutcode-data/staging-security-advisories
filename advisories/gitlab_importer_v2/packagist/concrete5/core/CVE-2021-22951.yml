summary: |
  Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
  Unauthorized individuals could view password protected files using view_inline in Concrete CMS (previously concrete 5) prior to version 8.5.7. Concrete CMS now checks to see if a file has a password in view_inline and, if it does, the file is not rendered.For version 8.5.6, the following mitigations were put in place a. restricting file types for view_inline to images only b. putting a warning in the file manager to advise users.Credit for discovery: "Solar Security Research Team"Concrete CMS security team CVSS scoring is 5.3: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:NThis fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0
