summary: |
  Livewire Remote Code Execution on File Uploads
  In livewire/livewire prior to `v2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension.
  If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack:

  - Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`
  - Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk
  - Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files
