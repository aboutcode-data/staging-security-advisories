aliases:
  - CVE-2025-65012
  - GHSA-84hf-8gh5-575j
summary: |
  Kirby CMS has cross-site scripting (XSS) in the changes dialog
  The "Changes" dialog in the Panel displays all content models (pages, files, users) with changed content, i.e. with content that has not yet been published. Each changed model is listed with its preview image/icon and its title/name.

  Attackers could change the title of any page or the name of any user to a malicious string. Then they could modify any content field of the same model without saving, making the model a candidate for display in the "Changes" dialog. If another authenticated user subsequently opened the dialog in their Panel, the malicious code would be executed.
