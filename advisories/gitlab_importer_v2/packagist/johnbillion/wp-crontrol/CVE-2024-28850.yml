summary: |
  WP Crontrol vulnerable to possible RCE when combined with a pre-condition
  WP Crontrol includes a feature that allows administrative users to create events in the WP-Cron system that store and execute PHP code [subject to the restrictive security permissions documented here](https://wp-crontrol.com/docs/php-cron-events/). While there is _no known vulnerability in this feature on its own_, there exists potential for this feature to be vulnerable to RCE if it were specifically targeted via vulnerability chaining that exploited a separate SQLi (or similar) vulnerability.

  This is exploitable on a site if one of the below preconditions are met:

  * The site is vulnerable to a writeable SQLi vulnerability in any plugin, theme, or WordPress core
  * The site's database is compromised at the hosting level
  * The site is vulnerable to a method of updating arbitrary options in the `wp_options` table
  * The site is vulnerable to a method of triggering an arbitrary action, filter, or function with control of the parameters
