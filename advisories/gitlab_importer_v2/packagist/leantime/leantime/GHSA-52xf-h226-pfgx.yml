summary: |
  Leantime allows Refelected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  The vulnerability in Leantime's "overdue" section allows attackers to upload malicious image files containing XSS payloads. When other users view these files, the scripts execute, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions. Improving input validation and output encoding in the file upload process can prevent this exploit. Accessing and enhancing the relevant source code modules is crucial for addressing this security flaw effectively.
