  Information disclosure in backend content tree menu
  If a view has been disabled in site.ini `SiteAccessRules` Rules, and an attacker accesses the backend with the URL to this module, then the tree menu may be displayed. Since the tree menu may contain hidden items, this may lead to information disclosure.
