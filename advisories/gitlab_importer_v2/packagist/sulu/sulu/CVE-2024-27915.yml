  The problem is patched with Version `2.4.17` and `2.5.13`.

  ### Workarounds

  _Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_

  Remove  following lines from `vendor/symfony/security-http/HttpUtils.php`:

  ```
  -            // Shortcut if request has already been matched before
  -            if ($request->attributes->has('_route')) {
  -                return $path === $request->attributes->get('_route');
   -           }
  ```

  Or do not install `symfony/security-http` versions greater equal than `v5.4.30` or `v6.3.6`.
