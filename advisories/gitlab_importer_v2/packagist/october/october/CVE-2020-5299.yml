summary: |
  Command Injection
  In OctoberCMS, any users with the ability to modify any data that could eventually be exported as a CSV file from the `ImportExportController` could potentially introduce a CSV injection into the data to cause the generated CSV export file to be malicious. This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful attack can be completed: Have found a vulnerability in the victim's spreadsheet software of choice. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software.
