aliases:
  - CVE-2024-24764
  - GHSA-v2vf-jv88-3fp5
summary: |
  October System module has an Open Redirect for Administrator Accounts
  This advisory affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect outside the scope of the active host.

  This vulnerability assumes a trusted user will attack another trusted user and cannot be actively exploited without access to the administration panel and interaction from the other user.
