  CSRF Vulnerability
  A number of form actions in the Forum module are directly accessible. A malicious user (e.g. spammer) can use GET requests to create Members and post to forums, bypassing CSRF and anti-spam measures. Additionally, a forum moderator could be tricked into clicking a specially crafted URL, resulting in a topic being moved.
