summary: |
  Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
  Metersphere is an opensource testing framework.

Attackers would be limited to overwriting files that the metersphere process has access to. This issue has been addressed in version 2.10.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
