  PowSyBl Core contains Polynomial REDoS’es
  _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

  This is an advisory for a **potential polynomial Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** vulnerability in the PowSyBl's DataSource mechanism. When the `listNames(String regex)` method is called on a DataSource, the user-supplied regular expression (which may be unvalidated) is compiled and evaluated against a collection of file-like resource names.

  To trigger a **polynomial ReDoS** via this mechanism, **two attacker-controlled conditions** must be met:
  - **Control over the regex input** passed into `listNames(String regex)`.
  - _Example:_ An attacker supplies a malicious pattern like `(.*a){10000}`.
  - **Control or influence over the file/resource names** being matched.
  - _Example:_ Filenames such as `"aaaa...!"` that induce regex engine backtracking.

  If both conditions are satisfied, a malicious actor can cause **significant CPU consumption** due to regex backtracking — even
  with polynomial patterns. Since both inputs can be controlled via a publicly accessible method or external filesystem handling,
  the `listNames(String regex)` method is considered vulnerable to polynomial **REDoS**.

  Unlike classic _catastrophic exponential_ ReDoS, this subtle attack exploits a greedy `.*` prefix followed by a fixed suffix, repeated multiple times.
  When applied to long filenames that almost match the pattern, the regex engine performs extensive backtracking, degrading performance predictably with input size. In a multi-tenant environment, an attacker can degrade the performance - and thereby the availability - of the server to an extent that it affects other users of the application. This can for example be useful if an attacker wants to delay other users in a scenario where a time advantage can be a competitive advantage.
  A tricky part in this is that the attacker needs to control both the pattern and the input which may not always be the case.
