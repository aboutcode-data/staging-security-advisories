summary: CKEditor Integration UI adds support for editing wiki pages using CKEditor. Prior to
  versions 1.64.3,t he `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked a protection against Cross-Site
  Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to execute macros with the rights of the current user. If
  a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to this
  document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a corresponding URL embedded in
  a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary remote code execution and the attacker
  could gain rights, access private information or impact the availability of the wiki. The
  issue has been patched in the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been patched
  in the version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting with XWiki 14.6 RC1. There
  are no known workarounds for this other than upgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed
  version.
