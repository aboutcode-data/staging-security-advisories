summary: |
  Opencast publishes global system account credentials
  The issue was mostly mitigated before, drastically reducing the risk. See references below for more information.

  ### Impact

  Opencast before version 10.6 will try to authenticate against any external services listed in a media package when it is trying to access the files, sending the global system user's credentials, regardless of the target being part of the Opencast cluster or not.

  Previous mitigations already prevented clear text authentications for such requests (e.g. HTTP Basic authentication), but with enough malicious intent, even hashed credentials can be broken.

  ### Patches

  Opencast 10.6 will now send authentication requests only against servers which are part of the Opencast cluster, preventing external services from getting any form of authentication attempt in the first place.

  ### Workarounds

  No workaround available.
