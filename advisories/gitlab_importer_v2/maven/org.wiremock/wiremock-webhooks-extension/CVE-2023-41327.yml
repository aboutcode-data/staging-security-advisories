  - GHSA-hq8w-9w8w-pmx7
summary: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\nWireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services.\
  \ WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain\
  \ addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address\
  \ rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension\
  \ 3.0.0-beta-15, the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks,\
  \ so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings.\
  \ Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded\
  \ to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s instance. For example, If someone is running\
  \ the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests\
  \ against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using\
  \ another exploit, via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1\
  \ and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users\
  \ unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations."
