summary: |
  GeoServer is vulnerable to Unauthenticated XML External Entities (XXE) attack via WMS GetMap feature
  An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability was identified. The application accepts XML input through a specific endpoint ``/geoserver/wms`` operation ``GetMap``. However, this input is not sufficiently sanitized or restricted, allowing an attacker to define external entities within the XML request.

  An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack that occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.

  By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can:
  - Read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
  - Conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to interact with internal systems.
  - Execute Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by exhausting resources.
