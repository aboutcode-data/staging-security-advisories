summary: |
  Field-level security issue with .keyword fields in OpenSearch
  ### Advisory title: Field-level security issue with .keyword fields

  ### Affected versions:
  OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1

  ### Patched versions:
  OpenSearch 1.3.8 and 2.5.0

  ### Impact:
  There is an issue in the implementation of field-level security (FLS) and field masking where rules written to explicitly exclude fields are not correctly applied for certain queries that rely on their auto-generated .keyword fields.

  This issue is only present for authenticated users with read access to the indexes containing the restricted fields.

  ### Workaround:
  FLS rules that use explicit exclusions can be written to grant explicit access instead. Policies authored in this way are not subject to this issue.

  ### Patches:
  OpenSearch versions 1.3.8 and 2.5.0 contain a fix for this issue.
