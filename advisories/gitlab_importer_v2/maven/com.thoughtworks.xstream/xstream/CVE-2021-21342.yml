summary: |
  Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream, there is a vulnerability where the processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information.
