summary: |
  XWiki exposes passwords and emails stored in fields not named password/email in xml.vm
  The XML export of a page in XWiki that can be triggered by any user with view rights on a page by appending `?xpage=xml` to the URL includes password and email properties stored on a document that aren't named `password` or `email`. This allows any user to obtain the salted and hashed user account validation or password reset token. As those tokens are randomly generated strings, the immediate impact of this should be low. The user's password and email itself aren't exposed as those fields are named `password` and `email` and thus aren't affected. However, depending on how the wiki is used, there could be extensions or custom code that store passwords in plain text in such password properties that would be exposed by this vulnerability.
