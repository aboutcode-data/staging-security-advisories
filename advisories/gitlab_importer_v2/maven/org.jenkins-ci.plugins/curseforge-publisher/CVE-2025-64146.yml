summary: |
  Jenkins Curseforge Publisher Plugin stores API Keys unencrypted in job config.xml files
  Jenkins Curseforge Publisher Plugin 1.0 and earlier stores API Keys unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

  These keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

  Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these keys, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

  As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
