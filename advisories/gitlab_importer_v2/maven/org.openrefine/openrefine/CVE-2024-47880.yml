  - CVE-2024-47880
  - GHSA-79jv-5226-783f
summary: |
  OpenRefine has a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) from POST request in ExportRowsCommand
  The `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also taken from the request.

  An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine.

  The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row.
