aliases:
  - CVE-2022-41946
  - GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h
summary: |
  TemporaryFolder on unix-like systems does not limit access to created files
  **Vulnerability**

  `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)`
  and

  `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)`

  will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 51k


  Example of vulnerable code:

  ```java
  String s = "some very large string greater than 51200 bytes";

  PreparedStatement.setInputStream(1, new ByteArrayInputStream(s.getBytes()) );
  ```
  This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS.

  Impact
  On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system.

  This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability.

  When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability, here are the important questions to ask:

  Is the driver running in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users.
  If yes, and you answered 'yes' to question 1, this vulnerability impacts you.
  If no, this vulnerability does not impact you.
  Patches
  Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using.

  Java 1.8 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 42.2.27, 42.3.8, 42.4.3, 42.5.1
  Java 1.7 users: this vulnerability is fixed in 42.2.27.jre7
  Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available; you must use the workaround below.
  Workarounds
  If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability.
