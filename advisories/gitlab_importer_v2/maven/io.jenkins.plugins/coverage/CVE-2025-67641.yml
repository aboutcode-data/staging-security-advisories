summary: |
  Jenkins Coverage Plugin has a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
  Jenkins Coverage Plugin 2.3054.ve1ff7b_a_a_123b_ and earlier does not validate the configured coverage results ID when creating coverage results, only when submitting the job configuration through the UI, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permission to use a `javascript:` scheme URL as identifier by configuring the job through the REST API, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
