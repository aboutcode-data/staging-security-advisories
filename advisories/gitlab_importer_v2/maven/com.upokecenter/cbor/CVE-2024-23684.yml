summary: |
  Denial of service in CBOR library
  Due to this library's use of an inefficient algorithm, it is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when a maliciously crafted input is passed to `DecodeFromBytes` or other CBOR decoding mechanisms in this library.

  Affected versions _include_ versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0.

  This vulnerability was privately reported to me.
