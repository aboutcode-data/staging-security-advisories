summary: "Validation bypass vulnerability\nBack in min June a security vulnerability was reported\
  \ to the team, the reason for the slow response was due to ownership of some packages\nwas\
  \ locked and we wanted to be sure to update all packages before any disclosure was released.\n\
  \nThe issue is deemed being a Low severity vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability\
  \ impacts users who rely on the for last digits of personnummer to be a _real_ personnummer.\
  \ \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue have been patched in all repositories. The following versions\
  \ should be updated to as soon as possible:\n\nC# 3.0.2 \nD 3.0.1 \nDart 3.0.3 \nElixir 3.0.0\
  \ \nGo 3.0.1 \nJava 3.3.0 \nJavaScript 3.1.0 \nKotlin 1.1.0 \nLua 3.0.1 \nPHP 3.0.2 \nPerl\
  \ 3.0.0 \nPython 3.0.2 \nRuby 3.0.1 \nRust 3.0.0 \nScala 3.0.1 \nSwift 1.0.1 \n\nIf you are\
  \ using any of the earlier packages, please update to latest.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue\
  \ arrieses from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the last four digits\
  \ of the personnummer to be\n000, which is invalid. To mitigate this without upgrading, a\
  \ check on the last four digits can be made to make sure it's not\n000x.\n\n### For more information\n\
