summary: |
  Eclipse Parsson Denial of Service vulnerability
  In Eclipse Parsson before versions 1.1.4 and 1.0.5, Parsing JSON from untrusted sources can lead malicious actors to exploit the fact that the built-in support for parsing numbers with large scale in Java has a number of edge cases where the input text of a number can lead to much larger processing time than one would expect.


  To mitigate the risk, parsson put in place a size limit for the numbers as well as their scale.
