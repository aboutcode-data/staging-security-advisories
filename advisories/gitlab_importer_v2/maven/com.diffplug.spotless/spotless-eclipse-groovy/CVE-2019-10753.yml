summary: |
  Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres
  Spotless was resolving dependencies over an insecure channel (http). If the build occurred over an insecure connection, a malicious user could perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the build and alter the build artifacts that were produced. In case that any of these artifacts were compromised, any developers using these could be altered.
