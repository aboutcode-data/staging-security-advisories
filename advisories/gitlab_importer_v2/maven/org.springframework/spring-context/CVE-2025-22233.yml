summary: |
  Spring Framework DataBinder Case Sensitive Match Exception
  CVE-2024-38820 ensured Locale-independent, lowercase conversion for both the configured disallowedFields patterns and for request parameter names. However, there are still cases where it is possible to bypass the disallowedFields checks.

  Affected Spring Products and Versions

  Spring Framework:
  *  6.2.0 - 6.2.6

  *  6.1.0 - 6.1.19

  *  6.0.0 - 6.0.27

  *  5.3.0 - 5.3.42
  *  Older, unsupported versions are also affected



  Mitigation

  Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

  | Affected version(s) | Fix Version | Availability |
  | - | - | - |
  | 6.2.x |  6.2.7 | OSS |
  | 6.1.x |  6.1.20 | OSS |
  | 6.0.x |  6.0.28 |  Commercial https://enterprise.spring.io/ |
  | 5.3.x |  5.3.43 | Commercial https://enterprise.spring.io/  |

  No further mitigation steps are necessary.


  Generally, we recommend using a dedicated model object with properties only for data binding, or using constructor binding since constructor arguments explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding through the declarativeBinding flag. See the Model Design section in the reference documentation.

  For setting binding, prefer the use of allowedFields (an explicit list) over disallowedFields.
