summary: "Grackle has StackOverflowError in GraphQL query processing\n### Impact\n\nPrior to\
  \ this fix, the GraphQL query parsing was vulnerable to `StackOverflowError`s. The possibility\
  \ of small queries resulting in stack overflow is a potential denial of service vulnerability.\n\
  \nThis potentially affects all applications using Grackle which have untrusted users.\n\n\
  > [!CAUTION] \n> **No specific knowledge of an application's GraphQL schema would be required\
  \ to construct a pathological query.**\n\n### Patches\nThe stack overflow issues have been\
  \ resolved in the v0.18.0 release of Grackle.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers could interpose a\
  \ sanitizing layer in between untrusted input and Grackle query processing."
