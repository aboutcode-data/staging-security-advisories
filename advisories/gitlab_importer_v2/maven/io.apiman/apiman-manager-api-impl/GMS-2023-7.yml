summary: |
  Apiman Manager API affected by Jackson denial of service vulnerability
  ### Impact

  Due to a vulnerability in `jackson-databind <= 2.12.6.0`, an authenticated attacker could craft an Apiman policy configuration which, when saved, may cause a denial of service on the Apiman Manager API.

  This does **not** affect the Apiman Gateway.

  ### Patches

  Upgrade to Apiman 3.0.0.Final or later.

  If you are using an older version of Apiman and need to remain on that version, contact your Apiman [support provider](https://www.apiman.io/support.html) for advice/long-term support.

  ### Workarounds

  If all users of the Apiman Manager are trusted then you may assess this is low risk, as an account is required to exploit the vulnerability.
