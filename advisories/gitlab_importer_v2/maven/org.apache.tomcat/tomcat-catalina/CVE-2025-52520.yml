summary: |
  Apache Tomcat Catalina is vulnerable to DoS attack through bypassing of size limits
  For some unlikely configurations of multipart upload, an Integer Overflow vulnerability in Apache Tomcat could lead to a DoS via bypassing of size limits.

  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.8, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.42, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.106. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected.

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.9, 10.1.43 or 9.0.107, which fix the issue.
