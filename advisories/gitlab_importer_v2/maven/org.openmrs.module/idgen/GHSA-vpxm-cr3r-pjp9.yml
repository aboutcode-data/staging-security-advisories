  General OpenMRS Security Advisory, January 2025: Penetration Testing Results and Patches
  We recently underwent Penetration Testing of OpenMRS by a third-party company. **Vulnerabilities were found, and fixes have been made and released.** We've released security updates that include critical fixes, and so, we strongly recommend upgrading affected modules.

  **This notice applies to _all_ OpenMRS instances.** The testers used the OpenMRS v3 Reference Application (O3 RefApp); however, their findings highlighted modules commonly used in older OpenMRS applications, including the O2 RefApp.
