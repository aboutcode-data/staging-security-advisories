summary: |
  Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
  The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat with a configuration edge case that was highly unlikely to be used, the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to CVE-2020-9494. Note that both the previously published prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and the previously published mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to this issue.
