summary: |
  Apache Tomcat: Potential RCE and/or information disclosure and/or information corruption with partial PUT
  Path Equivalence: 'file.Name' (Internal Dot) leading to Remote Code Execution and/or Information disclosure and/or malicious content added to uploaded files via write enabled Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat.

  This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected.

  If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:
  - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
  - support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
  - a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads
  - attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded
  - the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT

  If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to perform remote code execution:
  - writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
  - support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
  - application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the default storage location
  - application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack

  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99, which fixes the issue.
