summary: "Apache Derby: LDAP injection vulnerability in authenticator\nA cleverly devised username\
  \ might bypass LDAP authentication checks. In \nLDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this\
  \ could let an attacker fill \nup the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-authenticated\
  \ \nDerby installations, this could also allow the attacker to execute \nmalware which was\
  \ visible to and executable by the account which booted \nthe Derby server. In LDAP-protected\
  \ databases which weren't also \nprotected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this vulnerability\
  \ could \nalso let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive data and run sensitive \ndatabase\
  \ functions and procedures.\n\nMitigation:\n\nUsers should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby 10.17.1.0.\n\
  \nAlternatively, users who wish to remain on older Java versions should \nbuild their own\
  \ Derby distribution from one of the release families to \nwhich the fix was backported: 10.16,\
  \ 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the \nreleases which correspond, respectively, with Java LTS\
  \ versions 17, 11, \nand 8."
