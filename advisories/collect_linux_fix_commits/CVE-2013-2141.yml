  c61f13eaa1ee17728c41370100d2d45c254ce76f:gcc-plugins: Add structleak for more stack initialization

  This plugin detects any structures that contain __user attributes and
  makes sure it is being fully initialized so that a specific class of
  information exposure is eliminated. (This plugin was originally designed
  to block the exposure of siginfo in CVE-2013-2141.)

  Ported from grsecurity/PaX. This version adds a verbose option to the
  plugin and the Kconfig.
