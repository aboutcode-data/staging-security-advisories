  670ae9caaca467ea1bfd325cb2a5c98ba87f94ad:vhost: fix info leak due to uninitialized memory

  struct vhost_msg within struct vhost_msg_node is copied to userspace.
  Unfortunately it turns out on 64 bit systems vhost_msg has padding after
  type which gcc doesn't initialize, leaking 4 uninitialized bytes to
  userspace.

  This padding also unfortunately means 32 bit users of this interface are
  broken on a 64 bit kernel which will need to be fixed separately.
