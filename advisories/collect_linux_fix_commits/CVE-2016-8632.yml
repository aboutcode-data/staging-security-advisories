  3de81b758853f0b29c61e246679d20b513c4cfec:tipc: check minimum bearer MTU

  Qian Zhang (张谦) reported a potential socket buffer overflow in
  tipc_msg_build() which is also known as CVE-2016-8632: due to
  insufficient checks, a buffer overflow can occur if MTU is too short for
  even tipc headers. As anyone can set device MTU in a user/net namespace,
  this issue can be abused by a regular user.

  As agreed in the discussion on Ben Hutchings' original patch, we should
  check the MTU at the moment a bearer is attached rather than for each
  processed packet. We also need to repeat the check when bearer MTU is
  adjusted to new device MTU. UDP case also needs a check to avoid
  overflow when calculating bearer MTU.
