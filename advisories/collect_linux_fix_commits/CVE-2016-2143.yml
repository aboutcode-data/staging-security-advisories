  2da33f9f96dabd62d6c7780cbce15818c2a6ce24:Merge branch 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/s390/linux

  Pull s390 fixes from Martin Schwidefsky:
   "Three bug fixes:
     - The fix for the page table corruption (CVE-2016-2143)
     - The diagnose statistics introduced a regression for the dasd diag
       driver
     - Boot crash on systems without the set-program-parameters facility"

  * 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/s390/linux:
    s390/mm: four page table levels vs. fork
    s390/cpumf: Fix lpp detection
    s390/dasd: fix diag 0x250 inline assembly
  3446c13b268af86391d06611327006b059b8bab1:s390/mm: four page table levels vs. fork

  The fork of a process with four page table levels is broken since
  git commit 6252d702c5311ce9 "[S390] dynamic page tables."

  All new mm contexts are created with three page table levels and
  an asce limit of 4TB. If the parent has four levels dup_mmap will
  add vmas to the new context which are outside of the asce limit.
  The subsequent call to copy_page_range will walk the three level
  page table structure of the new process with non-zero pgd and pud
  indexes. This leads to memory clobbers as the pgd_index *and* the
  pud_index is added to the mm->pgd pointer without a pgd_deref
  in between.

  The init_new_context() function is selecting the number of page
  table levels for a new context. The function is used by mm_init()
  which in turn is called by dup_mm() and mm_alloc(). These two are
  used by fork() and exec(). The init_new_context() function can
  distinguish the two cases by looking at mm->context.asce_limit,
  for fork() the mm struct has been copied and the number of page
  table levels may not change. For exec() the mm_alloc() function
  set the new mm structure to zero, in this case a three-level page
  table is created as the temporary stack space is located at
  STACK_TOP_MAX = 4TB.

  This fixes CVE-2016-2143.
