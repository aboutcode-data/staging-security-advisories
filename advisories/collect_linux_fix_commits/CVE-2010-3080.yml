  27f7ad53829f79e799a253285318bff79ece15bd:ALSA: seq/oss - Fix double-free at error path of snd_seq_oss_open()

  The error handling in snd_seq_oss_open() has several bad codes that
  do dereferecing released pointers and double-free of kmalloc'ed data.
  The object dp is release in free_devinfo() that is called via
  private_free callback.  The rest shouldn't touch this object any more.

  The patch changes delete_port() to call kfree() in any case, and gets
  rid of unnecessary calls of destructors in snd_seq_oss_open().

  Fixes CVE-2010-3080.
