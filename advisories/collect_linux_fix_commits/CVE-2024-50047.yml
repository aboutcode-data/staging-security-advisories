  b220bed63330c0e1733dc06ea8e75d5b9962b6b6:smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto

  The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed asynchronous crypto handling from
  crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
  However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause
  use-after-free crashes:

    crypt_message()
      // Allocate the creq buffer containing the req
      creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &req);

      // Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately
      rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req) : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);

      // Free creq while async operation is still in progress
      kvfree_sensitive(creq, ...);

  Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for
  performance. When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,
  the operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),
  the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
  when the driver later accesses the freed memory.

  This results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto
  driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
  crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.

  The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't
  guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in
  the mask, async implementations can be selected.

  Fix by restoring the async crypto handling:
  - DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking
  - aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification
  - crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion

  This ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation
  completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the
  CVE-2024-50047 fix.
