  8f493d797bc1fe470377adc9d8775845427e240e:[PATCH] Make sure interleave masks have at least one node set

  Otherwise a bad mem policy system call can confuse the interleaving
  code into referencing undefined nodes.

  Originally reported by Doug Chapman

  I was told it's CVE-2005-3358
  (one has to love these security people - they make everything sound important)
