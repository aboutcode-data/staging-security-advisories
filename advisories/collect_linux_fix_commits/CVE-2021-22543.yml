  f8be156be163a052a067306417cd0ff679068c97:KVM: do not allow mapping valid but non-reference-counted pages

  It's possible to create a region which maps valid but non-refcounted
  pages (e.g., tail pages of non-compound higher order allocations). These
  host pages can then be returned by gfn_to_page, gfn_to_pfn, etc., family
  of APIs, which take a reference to the page, which takes it from 0 to 1.
  When the reference is dropped, this will free the page incorrectly.

  Fix this by only taking a reference on valid pages if it was non-zero,
  which indicates it is participating in normal refcounting (and can be
  released with put_page).

  This addresses CVE-2021-22543.
