  df09162550fbb53354f0c88e85b5d0e6129ee9cc:tracing: t_start: reset FTRACE_ITER_HASH in case of seek/pread

  Be sure to avoid entering t_show() with FTRACE_ITER_HASH set without
  having properly started the iterator to iterate the hash.  This case is
  degenerate and, as discovered by Robert Swiecki, can cause t_hash_show()
  to misuse a pointer.  This causes a NULL ptr deref with possible security
  implications.  Tracked as CVE-2010-3079.
