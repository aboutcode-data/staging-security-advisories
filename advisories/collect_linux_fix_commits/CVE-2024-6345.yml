  52e371914ed37f531a8d8c3b4cf1a1af2753eb6d:drm/ci: Upgrade setuptools requirement to 70.0.0

  GitHub Dependabot has issued the following alert:

  "Upgrade setuptools to version 70.0.0 or later.

   A vulnerability in the package_index module of pypa/setuptools
   versions up to 69.1.1 allows for remote code execution via its
   download functions. These functions, which are used to download
   packages from URLs provided by users or retrieved from package
   index servers, are susceptible to code injection. If these
   functions are exposed to user-controlled inputs, such as package
   URLs, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. The
   issue is fixed in version 70.0.

   Severity: 8.8 / 10 (High)
   Attack vector:        Network
   Attack complexity:        Low
   Privileges required:     None
   User interaction:    Required
   Scope:              Unchanged
   Confidentiality:         High
   Integrity:               High
   Availability:            High
   CVE ID:         CVE-2024-6345"

  To avoid disturbing everyone with the kernel repo hosted on GitHub,
  I suggest we upgrade our python dependencies once again to appease
  GitHub Dependabot.
