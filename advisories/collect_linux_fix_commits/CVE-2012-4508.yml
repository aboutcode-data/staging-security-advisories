  e589db7a6a9c8f1557007f2cc765ee28ad7a1edd:Merge tag 'ext4_for_linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4

  Pull ext4 fixes from Ted Ts'o:
   "Various bug fixes for ext4.  The most serious of them fixes a security
    bug (CVE-2012-4508) which leads to stale data exposure when we have
    fallocate racing against writes to files undergoing delayed
    allocation.  We also have two fixes for the metadata checksum feature,
    the most serious of which can cause the superblock to have a invalid
    checksum after a power failure."
