  e04480920d1eec9c061841399aa6f35b6f987d8b:Bluetooth: defer cleanup of resources in hci_unregister_dev()

  syzbot is hitting might_sleep() warning at hci_sock_dev_event() due to
  calling lock_sock() with rw spinlock held [1].

  It seems that history of this locking problem is a trial and error.

  Commit b40df5743ee8 ("[PATCH] bluetooth: fix socket locking in
  hci_sock_dev_event()") in 2.6.21-rc4 changed bh_lock_sock() to
  lock_sock() as an attempt to fix lockdep warning.

  Then, commit 4ce61d1c7a8e ("[BLUETOOTH]: Fix locking in
  hci_sock_dev_event().") in 2.6.22-rc2 changed lock_sock() to
  local_bh_disable() + bh_lock_sock_nested() as an attempt to fix the
  sleep in atomic context warning.

  Then, commit 4b5dd696f81b ("Bluetooth: Remove local_bh_disable() from
  hci_sock.c") in 3.3-rc1 removed local_bh_disable().

  Then, commit e305509e678b ("Bluetooth: use correct lock to prevent UAF
  of hdev object") in 5.13-rc5 again changed bh_lock_sock_nested() to
  lock_sock() as an attempt to fix CVE-2021-3573.

  This difficulty comes from current implementation that
  hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) is responsible for dropping all
  references from sockets because hci_unregister_dev() immediately
  reclaims resources as soon as returning from
  hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG).

  But the history suggests that hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) was not
  doing what it should do.

  Therefore, instead of trying to detach sockets from device, let's accept
  not detaching sockets from device at hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG),
  by moving actual cleanup of resources from hci_unregister_dev() to
  hci_cleanup_dev() which is called by bt_host_release() when all
  references to this unregistered device (which is a kobject) are gone.

  Since hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) no longer resets
  hci_pi(sk)->hdev, we need to check whether this device was unregistered
  and return an error based on HCI_UNREGISTER flag.  There might be subtle
  behavioral difference in "monitor the hdev" functionality; please report
  if you found something went wrong due to this patch.
