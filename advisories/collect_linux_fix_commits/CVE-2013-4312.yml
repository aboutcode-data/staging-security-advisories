  759c01142a5d0f364a462346168a56de28a80f52:pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes

  On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
  OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
  typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
  memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
  prevent this from happening.

  This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
  which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
  them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
  be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
  against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
  pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.

  The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
  pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
  default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
  to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
  before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
  to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
  1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
  default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
  of pipes (eg: for splicing).

  712f4aad406bb1ed67f3f98d04c044191f0ff593:unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets

  It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
  the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
  to keep the process' fd count low.

  This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
  in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
  more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.
