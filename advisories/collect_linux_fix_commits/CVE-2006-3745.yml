  c164a9ba0a8870c5c9d353f63085319931d69f23:Fix sctp privilege elevation (CVE-2006-3745)

  sctp_make_abort_user() now takes the msg_len along with the msg
  so that we don't have to recalculate the bytes in iovec.
  It also uses memcpy_fromiovec() so that we don't go beyond the
  length allocated.

  It is good to have this fix even if verify_iovec() is fixed to
  return error on overflow.
