  6eb3c2822e2c5ef8f1a215c44ac451653aec0c09:Merge branch 'for-davem' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless

  John W. Linville says:

  ====================
  Please consider pulling this batch of fixes for the 3.13 stream...

  For the mac80211 bits, Johannes says:

  "Here's a fix for another potential radiotap parser buffer overrun thanks
  to Evan Huus, and a fix for a cfg80211 warning in a certain corner case
  (reconnecting to the same BSS)."

  For the bluetooth bits, Gustavo says:

  "Two patches in this pull request. An important fix from Marcel in the
  permission check for HCI User Channels, there was a extra check for
  CAP_NET_RAW, and it was now removed. These channels should only require
  CAP_NET_ADMIN. The other patch is a device id addition."

  On top of that...

  Sujith Manoharan provides a workaround for a hardware problem that
  can result in lost interrupts.

  Larry Finger fixes an oops when unloading the rtlwifi driver (Red
  Hat bug 852761).

  Mathy Vanhoef fixes a somewhat minor MAC address privacy issue
  (CVE-2013-4579).
