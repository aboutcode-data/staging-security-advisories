  ce9d419dbecc292cc3e06e8b1d6d123d3fa813a4:drm/i915: Sanity check pread/pwrite

  Move the access control up from the fast paths, which are no longer
  universally taken first, up into the caller. This then duplicates some
  sanity checking along the slow paths, but is much simpler.
  Tracked as CVE-2010-2962.
