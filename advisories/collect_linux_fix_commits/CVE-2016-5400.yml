  aa93d1fee85c890a34f2510a310e55ee76a27848:media: fix airspy usb probe error path

  Fix a memory leak on probe error of the airspy usb device driver.

  The problem is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register with
  v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.

  The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
  mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
  when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.

  A badusb device can emulate 64 of these devices, and then through
  continual emulated connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the
  kernel to run out of RAM and crash the kernel, thus causing a local DOS
  vulnerability.

  Fixes CVE-2016-5400

  785ef73dba6e9fefd2e5dd24546e0efa8698e5cd:[media] airspy: fix error logic during device register

  This patch addresses CVE-2016-5400, a local DOS vulnerability caused by
  a memory leak in the airspy usb device driver.

  The vulnerability is triggered when more than 64 usb devices register
  with v4l2 of type VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV.A badusb device can
  emulate 64 of these devices then through continual emulated
  connect/disconnect of the 65th device, cause the kernel to run out of
  RAM and crash the kernel.

  The vulnerability exists in kernel versions from 3.17 to current 4.7.

  The memory leak is caused by the probe function of the airspy driver
  mishandeling errors and not freeing the corresponding control structures
  when an error occours registering the device to v4l2 core.
