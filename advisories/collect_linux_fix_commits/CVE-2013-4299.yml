  e9c6a182649f4259db704ae15a91ac820e63b0ca:dm snapshot: fix data corruption

  This patch fixes a particular type of data corruption that has been
  encountered when loading a snapshot's metadata from disk.

  When we allocate a new chunk in persistent_prepare, we increment
  ps->next_free and we make sure that it doesn't point to a metadata area
  by further incrementing it if necessary.

  When we load metadata from disk on device activation, ps->next_free is
  positioned after the last used data chunk. However, if this last used
  data chunk is followed by a metadata area, ps->next_free is positioned
  erroneously to the metadata area. A newly-allocated chunk is placed at
  the same location as the metadata area, resulting in data or metadata
  corruption.

  This patch changes the code so that ps->next_free skips the metadata
  area when metadata are loaded in function read_exceptions.

  The patch also moves a piece of code from persistent_prepare_exception
  to a separate function skip_metadata to avoid code duplication.
