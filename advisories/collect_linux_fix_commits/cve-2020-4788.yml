  From Daniel's cover letter:

  IBM Power9 processors can speculatively operate on data in the L1 cache
  before it has been completely validated, via a way-prediction mechanism. It
  is not possible for an attacker to determine the contents of impermissible
  memory using this method, since these systems implement a combination of
  hardware and software security measures to prevent scenarios where
  protected data could be leaked.

  However these measures don't address the scenario where an attacker induces
  the operating system to speculatively execute instructions using data that
  the attacker controls. This can be used for example to speculatively bypass
  "kernel user access prevention" techniques, as discovered by Anthony
  Steinhauser of Google's Safeside Project. This is not an attack by itself,
  but there is a possibility it could be used in conjunction with
  side-channels or other weaknesses in the privileged code to construct an
  attack.

  This issue can be mitigated by flushing the L1 cache between privilege
  boundaries of concern.

  This patch series flushes the L1 cache on kernel entry (patch 2) and after the
  kernel performs any user accesses (patch 3). It also adds a self-test and
  performs some related cleanups.
