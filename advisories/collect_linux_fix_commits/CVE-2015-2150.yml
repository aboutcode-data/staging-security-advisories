summary: |
  af6fc858a35b90e89ea7a7ee58e66628c55c776b:xen-pciback: limit guest control of command register

  Otherwise the guest can abuse that control to cause e.g. PCIe
  Unsupported Request responses by disabling memory and/or I/O decoding
  and subsequently causing (CPU side) accesses to the respective address
  ranges, which (depending on system configuration) may be fatal to the
  host.

  Note that to alter any of the bits collected together as
  PCI_COMMAND_GUEST permissive mode is now required to be enabled
  globally or on the specific device.

  This is CVE-2015-2150 / XSA-120.
