  acf69c946233259ab4d64f8869d4037a198c7f06:net/packet: fix overflow in tpacket_rcv

  Using tp_reserve to calculate netoff can overflow as
  tp_reserve is unsigned int and netoff is unsigned short.

  This may lead to macoff receving a smaller value then
  sizeof(struct virtio_net_hdr), and if po->has_vnet_hdr
  is set, an out-of-bounds write will occur when
  calling virtio_net_hdr_from_skb.

  The bug is fixed by converting netoff to unsigned int
  and checking if it exceeds USHRT_MAX.

  This addresses CVE-2020-14386
