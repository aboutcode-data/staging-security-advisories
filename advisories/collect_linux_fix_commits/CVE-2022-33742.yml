  Pull xen security fixes from Juergen Gross:

   - XSA-403 (4 patches for blkfront and netfront drivers):

     Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions
     before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365,
     CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table
     doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data
     residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being
     accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).

   - XSA-405 (1 patch for netfront driver, only 5.10 and newer):

     While adding logic to support XDP (eXpress Data Path), a code label
     was moved in a way allowing for SKBs having references (pointers)
     retained for further processing to nevertheless be freed.

   - XSA-406 (1 patch for Arm specific dom0 code):

     When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep
     track of the foreign mappings.

     Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the
     related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be
     used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies
     of the rbtree. These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service
     (DoS) of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform
     further mappings of other guests' memory pages.

  * tag 'xsa-5.19-tag' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xen/tip:
    xen/arm: Fix race in RB-tree based P2M accounting
    xen-netfront: restore __skb_queue_tail() positioning in xennet_get_responses()
    xen/blkfront: force data bouncing when backend is untrusted
    xen/netfront: force data bouncing when backend is untrusted
    xen/netfront: fix leaking data in shared pages
    xen/blkfront: fix leaking data in shared pages
  2400617da7eebf9167d71a46122828bc479d64c9:xen/blkfront: force data bouncing when backend is untrusted

  Split the current bounce buffering logic used with persistent grants
  into it's own option, and allow enabling it independently of
  persistent grants.  This allows to reuse the same code paths to
  perform the bounce buffering required to avoid leaking contiguous data
  in shared pages not part of the request fragments.

  Reporting whether the backend is to be trusted can be done using a
  module parameter, or from the xenstore frontend path as set by the
  toolstack when adding the device.

  This is CVE-2022-33742, part of XSA-403.
