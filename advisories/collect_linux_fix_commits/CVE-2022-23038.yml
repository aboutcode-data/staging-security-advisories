  33172ab50a53578a95691310f49567c9266968b0:xen/scsifront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access() for mapped status

  It isn't enough to check whether a grant is still being in use by
  calling gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as a mapping could be realized
  by the other side just after having called that function.

  In case the call was done in preparation of revoking a grant it is
  better to do so via gnttab_try_end_foreign_access() and check the
  success of that operation instead.

  This is CVE-2022-23038 / part of XSA-396.

  - use gnttab_try_end_foreign_access()
  6b1775f26a2da2b05a6dc8ec2b5d14e9a4701a1a:xen/grant-table: add gnttab_try_end_foreign_access()

  Add a new grant table function gnttab_try_end_foreign_access(), which
  will remove and free a grant if it is not in use.

  Its main use case is to either free a grant if it is no longer in use,
  or to take some other action if it is still in use. This other action
  can be an error exit, or (e.g. in the case of blkfront persistent grant
  feature) some special handling.

  This is CVE-2022-23036, CVE-2022-23038 / part of XSA-396.
