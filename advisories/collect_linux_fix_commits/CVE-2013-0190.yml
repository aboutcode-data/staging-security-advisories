  This fixes CVE-2013-0228 / XSA-42

  Drew Jones while working on CVE-2013-0190 found that that unprivileged guest user
  in 32bit PV guest can use to crash the > guest with the panic like this:

  Petr says: "
   I've analysed the bug and I think that xen_iret() cannot cope with
   mangled DS, in this case zeroed out (null selector/descriptor) by either
   xen_failsafe_callback() or RESTORE_REGS because the corresponding LDT
   entry was invalidated by the reproducer. "

  Jan took a look at the preliminary patch and came up a fix that solves
  this problem:

  "This code gets called after all registers other than those handled by
  IRET got already restored, hence a null selector in %ds or a non-null
  one that got loaded from a code or read-only data descriptor would
  cause a kernel mode fault (with the potential of crashing the kernel
  as a whole, if panic_on_oops is set)."

  The way to fix this is to realize that the we can only relay on the
  registers that IRET restores. The two that are guaranteed are the
  %cs and %ss as they are always fixed GDT selectors. Also they are
  inaccessible from user mode - so they cannot be altered. This is
  the approach taken in this patch.

  Another alternative option suggested by Jan would be to relay on
  the subtle realization that using the %ebp or %esp relative references uses
  the %ss segment.  In which case we could switch from using %eax to %ebp and
  would not need the %ss over-rides. That would also require one extra
  instruction to compensate for the one place where the register is used
  as scaled index. However Andrew pointed out that is too subtle and if
  further work was to be done in this code-path it could escape folks attention
  and lead to accidents.

  This fixes CVE-2013-0190 / XSA-40

  There has been an error on the xen_failsafe_callback path for failed
  iret, which causes the stack pointer to be wrong when entering the
  iret_exc error path.  This can result in the kernel crashing.

  In the classic kernel case, the relevant code looked a little like:

          popl %eax      # Error code from hypervisor
          jz 5f
          addl $16,%esp
          jmp iret_exc   # Hypervisor said iret fault
  5:      addl $16,%esp
                         # Hypervisor said segment selector fault

  Here, there are two identical addls on either option of a branch which
  appears to have been optimised by hoisting it above the jz, and
  converting it to an lea, which leaves the flags register unaffected.

  In the PVOPS case, the code looks like:

          popl_cfi %eax         # Error from the hypervisor
          lea 16(%esp),%esp     # Add $16 before choosing fault path
          CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET -16
          jz 5f
          addl $16,%esp         # Incorrectly adjust %esp again
          jmp iret_exc

  It is possible unprivileged userspace applications to cause this
  behaviour, for example by loading an LDT code selector, then changing
  the code selector to be not-present.  At this point, there is a race
  condition where it is possible for the hypervisor to return back to
  userspace from an interrupt, fault on its own iret, and inject a
  failsafe_callback into the kernel.

  This bug has been present since the introduction of Xen PVOPS support
  in commit 5ead97c84 (xen: Core Xen implementation), in 2.6.23.
