  7807dafda21a549403d922da98dde0ddfeb70d08:libceph: bump CephXAuthenticate encoding version

  A dummy v3 encoding (exactly the same as v2) was introduced so that
  the monitors can distinguish broken clients that may not include their
  auth ticket in CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY request on reconnects, thus
  failing to prove previous possession of their global_id (one part of
  CVE-2021-20288).

  The kernel client has always included its auth ticket, so it is
  compatible with enforcing mode as is.  However we want to bump the
  encoding version to avoid having to authenticate twice on the initial
  connect -- all legacy (CephXAuthenticate < v3) are now forced do so in
  order to expose insecure global_id reclaim.

  Marking for stable since at least for 5.11 and 5.12 it is trivial
  (v2 -> v3).
