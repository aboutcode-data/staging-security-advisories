  f43bfaeddc79effbf3d0fcb53ca477cca66f3db8:atl2: Disable unimplemented scatter/gather feature

  atl2 includes NETIF_F_SG in hw_features even though it has no support
  for non-linear skbs.  This bug was originally harmless since the
  driver does not claim to implement checksum offload and that used to
  be a requirement for SG.

  Now that SG and checksum offload are independent features, if you
  explicitly enable SG *and* use one of the rare protocols that can use
  SG without checkusm offload, this potentially leaks sensitive
  information (before you notice that it just isn't working).  Therefore
  this obscure bug has been designated CVE-2016-2117.
