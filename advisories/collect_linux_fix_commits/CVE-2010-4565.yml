  9f260e0efa4766e56d0ac14f1aeea6ee5eb8fe83:CAN: Use inode instead of kernel address for /proc file

  Since the socket address is just being used as a unique identifier, its
  inode number is an alternative that does not leak potentially sensitive
  information.

  CC-ing stable because MITRE has assigned CVE-2010-4565 to the issue.
