  330d57fb98a916fa8e1363846540dd420e99499a:[PATCH] Fix sysctl unregistration oops (CVE-2005-2709)

  You could open the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<if>/<whatever> file, then
  wait for interface to go away, try to grab as much memory as possible in
  hope to hit the (kfreed) ctl_table.  Then fill it with pointers to your
  function.  Then do read from file you've opened and if you are lucky,
  you'll get it called as ->proc_handler() in kernel mode.

  So this is at least an Oops and possibly more.  It does depend on an
  interface going away though, so less of a security risk than it would
  otherwise be.
