  56b88b50565cd8b946a2d00b0c83927b7ebb055e:ALSA: pcm: Move rwsem lock inside snd_ctl_elem_read to prevent UAF

  Takes rwsem lock inside snd_ctl_elem_read instead of snd_ctl_elem_read_user
  like it was done for write in commit 1fa4445f9adf1 ("ALSA: control - introduce
  snd_ctl_notify_one() helper"). Doing this way we are also fixing the following
  locking issue happening in the compat path which can be easily triggered and
  turned into an use-after-free.

  64-bits:
  snd_ctl_ioctl
    snd_ctl_elem_read_user
      [takes controls_rwsem]
      snd_ctl_elem_read [lock properly held, all good]
      [drops controls_rwsem]

  32-bits:
  snd_ctl_ioctl_compat
    snd_ctl_elem_write_read_compat
      ctl_elem_write_read
        snd_ctl_elem_read [missing lock, not good]

  CVE-2023-0266 was assigned for this issue.
