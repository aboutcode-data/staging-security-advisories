  Pull xen security fixes from Juergen Gross:

   - XSA-403 (4 patches for blkfront and netfront drivers):

     Linux Block and Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions
     before sharing them with the backend (CVE-2022-26365,
     CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table
     doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data
     residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being
     accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).

   - XSA-405 (1 patch for netfront driver, only 5.10 and newer):

     While adding logic to support XDP (eXpress Data Path), a code label
     was moved in a way allowing for SKBs having references (pointers)
     retained for further processing to nevertheless be freed.

   - XSA-406 (1 patch for Arm specific dom0 code):

     When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep
     track of the foreign mappings.

     Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the
     related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be
     used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies
     of the rbtree. These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service
     (DoS) of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform
     further mappings of other guests' memory pages.

  * tag 'xsa-5.19-tag' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xen/tip:
    xen/arm: Fix race in RB-tree based P2M accounting
    xen-netfront: restore __skb_queue_tail() positioning in xennet_get_responses()
    xen/blkfront: force data bouncing when backend is untrusted
    xen/netfront: force data bouncing when backend is untrusted
    xen/netfront: fix leaking data in shared pages
    xen/blkfront: fix leaking data in shared pages
  307c8de2b02344805ebead3440d8feed28f2f010:xen/netfront: fix leaking data in shared pages

  When allocating pages to be used for shared communication with the
  backend always zero them, this avoids leaking unintended data present
  on the pages.

  This is CVE-2022-33740, part of XSA-403.
