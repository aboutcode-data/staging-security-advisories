  176df2457ef6207156ca1a40991c54ca01fef567:x86_64: Zero extend all registers after ptrace in 32bit entry path.

  Strictly it's only needed for eax.

  It actually does a little more than strictly needed -- the other registers
  are already zero extended.

  Also remove the now unnecessary and non functional compat task check
  in ptrace.

  This is CVE-2007-4573
