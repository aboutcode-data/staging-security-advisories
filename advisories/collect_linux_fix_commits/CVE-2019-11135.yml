  f8c7600d468bdb6e44ed3b3247c6e53f5be5d8de:x86/tsx: Set default TSX mode to auto

  At SUSE we've been releasing our kernels with TSX enabled for the past 6
  years and some customers have started to rely on it. Furthermore, the last
  known vulnerability concerning TSX was TAA (CVE-2019-11135) and a
  significant amount time has passed since then without anyone reporting any
  issues. Intel has released numerous processors which do not have the
  TAA vulnerability (Cooper/Ice Lake, Sapphire/Emerald/Granite Rappids)
  yet TSX remains being disabled by default.

  The main aim of this patch is to reduce the divergence between SUSE's
  configuration and the upstream by switching the default TSX mode to
  auto. I believe this strikes the right balance between keeping it
  enabled where appropriate (i.e every machine which doesn't contain the
  TAA vulnerability) and disabling it preventively.
