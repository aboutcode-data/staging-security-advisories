  965a7d72e798eb7af0aa67210e37cf7ecd1c9cad:mac80211: assure all fragments are encrypted

  Do not mix plaintext and encrypted fragments in protected Wi-Fi
  networks. This fixes CVE-2020-26147.

  Previously, an attacker was able to first forward a legitimate encrypted
  fragment towards a victim, followed by a plaintext fragment. The
  encrypted and plaintext fragment would then be reassembled. For further
  details see Section 6.3 and Appendix D in the paper "Fragment and Forge:
  Breaking Wi-Fi Through Frame Aggregation and Fragmentation".

  Because of this change there are now two equivalent conditions in the
  code to determine if a received fragment requires sequential PNs, so we
  also move this test to a separate function to make the code easier to
  maintain.
