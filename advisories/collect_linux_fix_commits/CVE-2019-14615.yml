  63d264fe0868cb755a3a887ee7b7b6e3da786804:Merge tag 'Intel-CVE-2019-14615' from bundle by Akeem Abodunrin.

  Merge Intel Gen9 graphics fix from Akeem Abodunrin:
   "Insufficient control flow in certain data structures for some Intel
    Processors with Intel Processor Graphics may allow an unauthenticated
    user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access

    This provides mitigation for Gen9 hardware. Note that Gen8 is not
    impacted due to a previously implemented workaround.

    The mitigation involves using an existing hardware feature to forcibly
    clear down all EU state at each context switch"

  Intel ID: PSIRT-TA-201910-001
  CVEID: CVE-2019-14615

  Intel GPU Hardware prior to Gen11 does not clear EU state
  during a context switch. This can result in information
  leakage between contexts.

  For Gen8 and Gen9, hardware provides a mechanism for
  fast cleardown of the EU state, by issuing a PIPE_CONTROL
  with bit 27 set. We can use this in a context batch buffer
  to explicitly cleardown the state on every context switch.

  As this workaround is already in place for gen8, we can borrow
  the code verbatim for Gen9.
