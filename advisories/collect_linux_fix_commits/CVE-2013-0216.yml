  0c35565b460ff99f973fb4a9ec63fbcb4176d2e6:Merge branch 'netback'

  Ian Campbell says:

  ====================
  The Xen netback implementation contains a couple of flaws which can
  allow a guest to cause a DoS in the backend domain, potentially
  affecting other domains in the system.

  CVE-2013-0216 is a failure to sanity check the ring producer/consumer
  pointers which can allow a guest to cause netback to loop for an
  extended period preventing other work from occurring.

  CVE-2013-0217 is a memory leak on an error path which is guest
  triggerable.

  The following series contains the fixes for these issues, as previously
  included in Xen Security Advisory 39:
  http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-02/msg00001.html

  Changes in v2:
   - Typo and block comment format fixes
   - Added stable Cc
