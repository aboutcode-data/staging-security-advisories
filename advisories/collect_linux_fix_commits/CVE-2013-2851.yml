  ffc8b30866879ed9ba62bd0a86fecdbd51cd3d19:block: do not pass disk names as format strings

  Disk names may contain arbitrary strings, so they must not be
  interpreted as format strings.  It seems that only md allows arbitrary
  strings to be used for disk names, but this could allow for a local
  memory corruption from uid 0 into ring 0.
