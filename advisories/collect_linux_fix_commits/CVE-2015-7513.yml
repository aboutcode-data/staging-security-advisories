  0185604c2d82c560dab2f2933a18f797e74ab5a8:KVM: x86: Reload pit counters for all channels when restoring state

  Currently if userspace restores the pit counters with a count of 0
  on channels 1 or 2 and the guest attempts to read the count on those
  channels, then KVM will perform a mod of 0 and crash.  This will ensure
  that 0 values are converted to 65536 as per the spec.

  This is CVE-2015-7513.
