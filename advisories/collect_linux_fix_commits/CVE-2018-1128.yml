  6daca13d2e72bedaaacfc08f873114c9307d5aea:libceph: add authorizer challenge

  When a client authenticates with a service, an authorizer is sent with
  a nonce to the service (ceph_x_authorize_[ab]) and the service responds
  with a mutation of that nonce (ceph_x_authorize_reply).  This lets the
  client verify the service is who it says it is but it doesn't protect
  against a replay: someone can trivially capture the exchange and reuse
  the same authorizer to authenticate themselves.

  Allow the service to reject an initial authorizer with a random
  challenge (ceph_x_authorize_challenge).  The client then has to respond
  with an updated authorizer proving they are able to decrypt the
  service's challenge and that the new authorizer was produced for this
  specific connection instance.

  The accepting side requires this challenge and response unconditionally
  if the client side advertises they have CEPHX_V2 feature bit.

  This addresses CVE-2018-1128.
