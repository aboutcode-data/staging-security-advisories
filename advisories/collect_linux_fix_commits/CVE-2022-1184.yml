  61a1d87a324ad5e3ed27c6699dfc93218fcf3201:ext4: fix check for block being out of directory size

  The check in __ext4_read_dirblock() for block being outside of directory
  size was wrong because it compared block number against directory size
  in bytes. Fix it.

  Fixes: 65f8ea4cd57d ("ext4: check if directory block is within i_size")

  65f8ea4cd57dbd46ea13b41dc8bac03176b04233:ext4: check if directory block is within i_size

  Currently ext4 directory handling code implicitly assumes that the
  directory blocks are always within the i_size. In fact ext4_append()
  will attempt to allocate next directory block based solely on i_size and
  the i_size is then appropriately increased after a successful
  allocation.

  However, for this to work it requires i_size to be correct. If, for any
  reason, the directory inode i_size is corrupted in a way that the
  directory tree refers to a valid directory block past i_size, we could
  end up corrupting parts of the directory tree structure by overwriting
  already used directory blocks when modifying the directory.

  Fix it by catching the corruption early in __ext4_read_dirblock().
