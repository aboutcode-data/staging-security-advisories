  0ef3a56b1c466629cd0bf482b09c7b0e5a085bb5:Merge branch 'CVE-2014-7975' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/luto/linux

  Pull do_umount fix from Andy Lutomirski:
   "This fix really ought to be safe.  Inside a mountns owned by a
    non-root user namespace, the namespace root almost always has
    MNT_LOCKED set (if it doesn't, then there's a bug, because rootfs
    could be exposed).  In that case, calling umount on "/" will return
    -EINVAL with or without this patch.

    Outside a userns, this patch will have no effect.  may_mount, required
    by umount, already checks
       ns_capable(current->nsproxy->mnt_ns->user_ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN)
    so an additional capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) check will have no effect.

    That leaves anything that calls umount on "/" in a non-root userns
    while chrooted.  This is the case that is currently broken (it
    remounts ro, which shouldn't be allowed) and that my patch changes to
    -EPERM.  If anything relies on *that*, I'd be surprised"

  a1480dcc3c706e309a88884723446f2e84fedd5b:fs: Add a missing permission check to do_umount

  Accessing do_remount_sb should require global CAP_SYS_ADMIN, but
  only one of the two call sites was appropriately protected.

  Fixes CVE-2014-7975.
