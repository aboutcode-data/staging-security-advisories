  543ce63b664e2c2f9533d089a4664b559c3e6b5b:lockdown: Fix kexec lockdown bypass with ima policy

  The lockdown LSM is primarily used in conjunction with UEFI Secure Boot.
  This LSM may also be used on machines without UEFI.  It can also be
  enabled when UEFI Secure Boot is disabled.  One of lockdown's features
  is to prevent kexec from loading untrusted kernels.  Lockdown can be
  enabled through a bootparam or after the kernel has booted through
  securityfs.

  If IMA appraisal is used with the "ima_appraise=log" boot param,
  lockdown can be defeated with kexec on any machine when Secure Boot is
  disabled or unavailable.  IMA prevents setting "ima_appraise=log" from
  the boot param when Secure Boot is enabled, but this does not cover
  cases where lockdown is used without Secure Boot.

  To defeat lockdown, boot without Secure Boot and add ima_appraise=log to
  the kernel command line; then:

    $ echo "integrity" > /sys/kernel/security/lockdown
    $ echo "appraise func=KEXEC_KERNEL_CHECK appraise_type=imasig" > \
      /sys/kernel/security/ima/policy
    $ kexec -ls unsigned-kernel

  Add a call to verify ima appraisal is set to "enforce" whenever lockdown
  is enabled.  This fixes CVE-2022-21505.
