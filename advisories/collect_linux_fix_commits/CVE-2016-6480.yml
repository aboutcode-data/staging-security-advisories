  fa00c437eef8dc2e7b25f8cd868cfa405fcc2bb3:aacraid: Check size values after double-fetch from user

  In aacraid's ioctl_send_fib() we do two fetches from userspace, one the
  get the fib header's size and one for the fib itself. Later we use the
  size field from the second fetch to further process the fib. If for some
  reason the size from the second fetch is different than from the first
  fix, we may encounter an out-of- bounds access in aac_fib_send(). We
  also check the sender size to insure it is not out of bounds. This was
  reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116751 and was
  assigned CVE-2016-6480.
