  b8c75e4a1b325ea0a9433fa8834be97b5836b946:media: dvb-core: Fix kernel WARNING for blocking operation in wait_event*()

  Using a semaphore in the wait_event*() condition is no good idea.
  It hits a kernel WARN_ON() at prepare_to_wait_event() like:
    do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1 set at
    prepare_to_wait_event+0x6d/0x690

  For avoiding the potential deadlock, rewrite to an open-coded loop
  instead.  Unlike the loop in wait_event*(), this uses wait_woken()
  after the condition check, hence the task state stays consistent.

  CVE-2023-31084 was assigned to this bug.
