  55480b4d228986e502f4651f8e53a6f264a1858e:[playground] Downgrade Next.js to a secure version (#35317)

  Was bumped to a canary in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/34499/
  which got never released as stable.

  Presumeably to use `Activity` which only made it into Activity in later
  Next.js releases. However, `Activity` never ended up being used due to
  incompatibilities with Monaco Editor. Downgrading should be safe.

  Downgrading to fix
  https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp.
  This will allow new deploys since Vercel is currently blocking new
  deploys of unsafe version
