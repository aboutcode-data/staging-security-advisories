  fbfe878f9777d4d52e1eaef1fca5170b9efee99a:Merge branch 'ps/http-gssapi-cred-delegation'

  In recent versions of cURL, GSSAPI credential delegation is
  disabled by default due to CVE-2011-2192; introduce a configuration
  to selectively allow enabling this.

  * ps/http-gssapi-cred-delegation:
    http: control GSSAPI credential delegation
  26a7b2342980f2eb46b47122d1d6dfbf13ed4ccb:http: control GSSAPI credential delegation

  Delegation of credentials is disabled by default in libcurl since
  version 7.21.7 due to security vulnerability CVE-2011-2192. Which
  makes troubles with GSS/kerberos authentication when delegation
  of credentials is required. This can be changed with option
  CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION in libcurl with set expected parameter
  since libcurl version 7.22.0.

  This patch provides new configuration variable http.delegation
  which corresponds to curl parameter "--delegation" (see man 1 curl).

  The following values are supported:

  * none (default).
  * policy
  * always
