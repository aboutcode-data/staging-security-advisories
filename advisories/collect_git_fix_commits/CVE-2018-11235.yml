  bb3a9265e505e9593faa260860f9b8929af0963e:fsck: refactor `fsck_blob()` to allow for more checks

  In general, we don't need to validate blob contents as they are opaque
  blobs about whose content Git doesn't need to care about. There are some
  exceptions though when blobs are linked into trees so that they would be
  interpreted by Git. We only have a single such check right now though,
  which is the one for gitmodules that has been added in the context of
  CVE-2018-11235.

  Now we have found another vulnerability with gitattributes that can lead
  to out-of-bounds writes and reads. So let's refactor `fsck_blob()` so
  that it is more extensible and can check different types of blobs.
