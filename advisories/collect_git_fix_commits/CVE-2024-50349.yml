summary: "08756131a3b7038a60365ae56804cea4301082a9:Merge branch 'disallow-control-characters-in-credential-urls-by-default'\n\
  \nThis addresses two vulnerabilities:\n\n- CVE-2024-50349:\n\n\tPrinting unsanitized URLs\
  \ when asking for credentials made the\n\tuser susceptible to crafted URLs (e.g. in recursive\
  \ clones) that\n\tmislead the user into typing in passwords for trusted sites that\n\twould\
  \ then be sent to untrusted sites instead.\n\n- CVE-2024-52006\n\n\tGit may pass on Carriage\
  \ Returns via the credential protocol to\n\tcredential helpers which use line-reading functions\
  \ that\n\tinterpret said Carriage Returns as line endings, even though Git\n\tdid not intend\
  \ that.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Schindelin <johannes.schindelin@gmx.de>"
