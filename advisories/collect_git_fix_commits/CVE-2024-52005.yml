  d3a5fddcad7d21e171c449472a69185bfb85535c:sideband: delay sanitizing by default to Git v3.0

  The sideband sanitization patches allow ANSI color sequences through
  by default, preserving compatibility with pre-receive hooks that
  provide colored output during `git push`.

  Even so, there is concern that changing any default behavior in a
  minor release may have unforeseen consequences. To accommodate this,
  defer the secure-by-default behavior to Git v3.0, where breaking
  changes are expected.

  This gives users and tooling time to prepare, while committing to
  address CVE-2024-52005 in Git v3.0.
