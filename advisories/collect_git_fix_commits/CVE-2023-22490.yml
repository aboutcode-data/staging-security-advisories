  2c9a4c731010685b86559c06637aeef2ac5ea06e:Merge branch 'tb/clone-local-symlinks' into maint-2.30

  Resolve a security vulnerability (CVE-2023-22490) where `clone_local()`
  is used in conjunction with non-local transports, leading to arbitrary
  path exfiltration.

  * tb/clone-local-symlinks:
    dir-iterator: prevent top-level symlinks without FOLLOW_SYMLINKS
    clone: delay picking a transport until after get_repo_path()
    t5619: demonstrate clone_local() with ambiguous transport
