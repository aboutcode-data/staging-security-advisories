  ace8c9c94f704482a1714400dd7d238a3c98e7bf:vendor: golang.org/x/net v0.36.0

  full diff: https://github.com/golang/net/compare/v0.35.0...v0.36.0

  Version v0.36.0 of golang.org/x/net fixes a vulnerability in the
  golang.org/x/net/proxy and golang.org/x/net/http/httpproxy packages
  which could cause the proxy to be bypassed.

  Matching of hosts against proxy patterns could improperly treat an IPv6
  zone ID as a hostname component. For example, when the NO_PROXY
  environment variable was set to "*.example.com", a request to
  "[::1%25.example.com]:80` would incorrectly match and not be proxied.

  Thanks to Juho Forsén of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2025-22870 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/71984.
