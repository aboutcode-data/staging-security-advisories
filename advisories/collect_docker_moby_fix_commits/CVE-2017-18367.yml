  full diff: https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp-golang/compare/32f571b70023028bd57d9288c20efbcb237f3ce0...689e3c1541a84461afc49c1c87352a6cedf72e9c

  Release notes:

  * Version 0.9.1 - May 21, 2019
  - Minimum supported version of libseccomp bumped to v2.2.0
  - Use Libseccomp's `seccomp_version` API to retrieve library version
  - Unconditionally set TSync attribute for filters, due to Go's heavily threaded nature
  - Fix CVE-2017-18367 - Multiple syscall arguments were incorrectly combined with logical-OR, instead of logical-AND
  - Fix a failure to build on Debian-based distributions due to CGo code
  - Fix unit test failures on 32-bit architectures
  - Improve several errors to be more verbose about their causes
  - Add support for SCMP_ACT_LOG (with libseccomp versions 2.4.x and higher), permitting syscalls but logging their execution
  - Add support for SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_LOG (with libseccomp versions 2.4.x and higher), logging not-allowed actions when they are denied
