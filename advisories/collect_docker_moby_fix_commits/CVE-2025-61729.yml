  - crypto/x509: excessive resource consumption in printing error string for host certificate validation

      Within HostnameError.Error(), when constructing an error string, there is no limit to the number of hosts that will be printed out.
      Furthermore, the error string is constructed by repeated string concatenation, leading to quadratic runtime.

      Therefore, a certificate provided by a malicious actor can result in excessive resource consumption.
      HostnameError.Error() now limits the number of hosts and utilizes strings.Builder when constructing an error string.

      Thanks to Philippe Antoine (Catena cyber) for reporting this issue.

      This is CVE-2025-61729 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/76445.

  - crypto/x509: excluded subdomain constraint does not restrict wildcard SANs

      An excluded subdomain constraint in a certificate chain does not restrict the
      usage of wildcard SANs in the leaf certificate. For example a constraint that
      excludes the subdomain test.example.com does not prevent a leaf certificate from
      claiming the SAN *.example.com.

      This is CVE-2025-61727 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/76442.
