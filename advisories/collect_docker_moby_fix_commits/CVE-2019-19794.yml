  021258661bc865f581a98cfe75e79af46dd91cb7:Update libnetwork and DNS library

  This makes sure that we don't become vulnerable to CVE-2018-17419 or
  CVE-2019-19794 in the future. While we are not currently vulnerable to
  either, there is a risk that a PR could be made which uses one of the
  vulnerable methods in the future, so it's worth going ahead and updating
  to ensure that a simple PR that would easily pass code review doesn't
  lead to a vulnerability.
