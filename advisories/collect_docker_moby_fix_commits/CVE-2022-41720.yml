  82b0ac1166cc553e2757c5d490ce69078064ef6e:update to go1.19.4

  Includes security fixes for net/http (CVE-2022-41717, CVE-2022-41720),
  and os (CVE-2022-41720).

  These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:

  - os, net/http: avoid escapes from os.DirFS and http.Dir on Windows

    The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files
    rooted at a given directory. These functions permitted access to Windows
    device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS("C:/tmp").Open("COM1")
    would open the COM1 device.
    Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access.

    In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory \(the root of the
    current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the
    drive and access any path on the system.

    The behavior of os.DirFS("") has changed. Previously, an empty root was
    treated equivalently to "/", so os.DirFS("").Open("tmp") would open the
    path "/tmp". This now returns an error.

    This is CVE-2022-41720 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/56694.

  - net/http: limit canonical header cache by bytes, not entries

    An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting
    HTTP/2 requests.

    HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP header keys sent by
    the client. While the total number of entries in this cache is capped,
    an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate
    approximately 64 MiB per open connection.

    This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 vX.Y.Z, for users
    manually configuring HTTP/2.

    Thanks to Josselin Costanzi for reporting this issue.

    This is CVE-2022-41717 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/56350.

    HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP header keys sent by
    the client. While the total number of entries in this cache is capped,
    an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate
    approximately 64 MiB per open connection.

    This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 vX.Y.Z, for users
    manually configuring HTTP/2.

    Thanks to Josselin Costanzi for reporting this issue.

    This is CVE-2022-41717 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/56350.

  52bc1ad744345b5dd9ec4d3af24ff66cdb23865f:update to go1.19.4

  Includes security fixes for net/http (CVE-2022-41717, CVE-2022-41720),
  and os (CVE-2022-41720).

  These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:

  - os, net/http: avoid escapes from os.DirFS and http.Dir on Windows

    The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files
    rooted at a given directory. These functions permitted access to Windows
    device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS("C:/tmp").Open("COM1")
    would open the COM1 device.
    Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access.

    In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory \(the root of the
    current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the
    drive and access any path on the system.

    The behavior of os.DirFS("") has changed. Previously, an empty root was
    treated equivalently to "/", so os.DirFS("").Open("tmp") would open the
    path "/tmp". This now returns an error.

    This is CVE-2022-41720 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/56694.

  - net/http: limit canonical header cache by bytes, not entries

    An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting
    HTTP/2 requests.

    the client. While the total number of entries in this cache is capped,
    an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate
