  19675151a3d3b947501fcad1dcacbd00e6f4b23e:Dockerfile: update runc binary to v1.3.3

  Update the version used in CI and for the static binaries.

  - release notes: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.3.3
  - full diff: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3

  This release contains fixes for three high-severity security
  vulnerabilities in runc (CVE-2025-31133, CVE-2025-52565, and
  CVE-2025-52881). All three vulnerabilities ultimately allow (through
  different methods) for full container breakouts by bypassing runc's
  restrictions for writing to arbitrary /proc files.

  (cherry picked from commit 35f6a780829fca1d3ef49ff96a0b3031462faeed)
