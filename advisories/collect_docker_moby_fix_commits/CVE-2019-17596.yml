      [security] Go 1.13.2 and Go 1.12.11 are released

      Hi gophers,

      We have just released Go 1.13.2 and Go 1.12.11 to address a recently reported
      security issue. We recommend that all affected users update to one of these
      releases (if you're not sure which, choose Go 1.13.2).

      Invalid DSA public keys can cause a panic in dsa.Verify. In particular, using
      crypto/x509.Verify on a crafted X.509 certificate chain can lead to a panic,
      even if the certificates don't chain to a trusted root. The chain can be
      delivered via a crypto/tls connection to a client, or to a server that accepts
      and verifies client certificates. net/http clients can be made to crash by an
      HTTPS server, while net/http servers that accept client certificates will
      recover the panic and are unaffected.

      Moreover, an application might crash invoking
      crypto/x509.(*CertificateRequest).CheckSignature on an X.509 certificate
      request, parsing a golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp Entity, or during a
      golang.org/x/crypto/otr conversation. Finally, a golang.org/x/crypto/ssh client
      can panic due to a malformed host key, while a server could panic if either
      PublicKeyCallback accepts a malformed public key, or if IsUserAuthority accepts
      a certificate with a malformed public key.

      The issue is CVE-2019-17596 and Go issue golang.org/issue/34960.

      Thanks to Daniel Mandragona for discovering and reporting this issue. We'd also
      like to thank regilero for a previous disclosure of CVE-2019-16276.
