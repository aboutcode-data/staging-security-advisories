  1ecd8ed5186a161c1c43ae7c99b1c81b97188619:Update frozen images in Dockerfiles

  This updates the versions of the frozen images used to their current
  version. The original reason for updating these images was to make sure
  they are not affected by [CVE-2016-1252 / DSA-3733-1](https://lwn.net/Articles/709119/),
  which is fixed in apt 1.0.9.8.4 and up.

  Note that `CVE-2016-1252` won't affect our test-suite, because no packages
  are installed during out tests. It is just "good practice" to keep these
  images up to date.

  The `debian:jessie`, and `buildpack-deps:jessie` in  `Dockerfile.s390x`,
  and `Dockerfile.armhf` have not been updated in this patch, because
  those images have not yet been updated to contain apt 1.0.9.8.4.

  While working on this, the `busybox` and `hello-world` were also updated
  to their latest version.

  Also removes a reference to `hack/make/.ensure-frozen-images`, which
  was removed in ff91276d1f5beab5582d9ca582ee01af13198333.

  The new busybox image has one layer less than the original,
  so updated `TestBuildSquashParent` to take that into account.
