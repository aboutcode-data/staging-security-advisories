  bda87b7de87be2bea500b5fe0afde2fb38e99b88:vendor: golang.org/x/crypto v0.45.0

  full diff: https://github.com/golang/crypto/compare/v0.44.0...v0.45.0

  Hello gophers,

  We have tagged version v0.45.0 of golang.org/x/crypto in order to address two
  security issues.

  This version fixes a vulnerability in the golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package and a
  vulnerability in the golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/agent package which could cause
  programs to consume unbounded memory or panic respectively.

  SSH servers parsing GSSAPI authentication requests don't validate the number of
  mechanisms specified in the request, allowing an attacker to cause unbounded
  memory consumption.

  Thanks to Jakub Ciolek for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2025-58181 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/76363.

  SSH Agent servers do not validate the size of messages when processing new
  identity requests, which may cause the program to panic if the message is
  malformed due to an out of bounds read.

  Thanks to Jakub Ciolek for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2025-47914 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/76364.

  Cheers, Go Security team
