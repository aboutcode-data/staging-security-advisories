  4701ca9f719f5386d2ca2417b566b5950aa8a929:Update to Go 1.19.3 to address CVE-2022-41716

      On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly
      check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious
      environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a
      value for a different environment variable. For example, the
      environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" set the variables "A=B" and
      "C=D".

      Thanks to RyotaK (https://twitter.com/ryotkak) for reporting this
      issue.

      This is CVE-2022-41716 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/56284.

  This Go release also fixes https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56309, a
  runtime bug which can cause random memory corruption when a goroutine
  exits with runtime.LockOSThread() set. This fix is necessary to unblock
  work to replace certain uses of pkg/reexec with unshared OS threads.
