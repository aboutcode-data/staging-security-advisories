  from the security mailing:

  > Hello gophers,
  >
  > Version v0.17.0 of golang.org/x/crypto fixes a protocol weakness in the
  > golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package that allowed a MITM attacker to compromise
  > the integrity of the secure channel before it was established, allowing
  > them to prevent transmission of a number of messages immediately after
  > the secure channel was established without either side being aware.
  >
  > The impact of this attack is relatively limited, as it does not compromise
  > confidentiality of the channel. Notably this attack would allow an attacker
  > to prevent the transmission of the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message, disabling a
  > handful of newer security features.
  >
  > This protocol weakness was also fixed in OpenSSH 9.6.
  >
  > Thanks to Fabian Bäumer, Marcus Brinkmann, and Jörg Schwenk from Ruhr
  > University Bochum for reporting this issue.
  >
  > This is CVE-2023-48795 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/64784.

  > Cheers,
  > Roland on behalf of the Go team
