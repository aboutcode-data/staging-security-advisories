  d664cfe1390eb623963dfc6f2d8bf02e6875ca60:update to go1.24.7

  This includes 1 security fix:

  - net/http: CrossOriginProtection bypass patterns are over-broad

      When passing patterns to CrossOriginProtection.AddInsecureBypassPattern,
      requests that would have redirected to those patterns (e.g. without a trailing
      slash) were also exempted, which might be unexpected.

      Thanks to Marco Gazerro for reporting this issue.

      This is CVE-2025-47910 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/75054.
