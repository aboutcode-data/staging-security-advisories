  [security] Go 1.21.2 and Go 1.20.9 are released

  Hello gophers,

  We have just released Go versions 1.21.2 and 1.20.9, minor point releases.

  These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the security policy:

  - cmd/go: line directives allows arbitrary execution during build

    "//line" directives can be used to bypass the restrictions on "//go:cgo_"
    directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to be passed during
    compliation. This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when
    running "go build". The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in
    which the directive lives, which makes exploting this issue significantly more
    complex.

    This is CVE-2023-39323 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/63211.
