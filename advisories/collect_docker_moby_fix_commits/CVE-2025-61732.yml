  go1.25.7 (released 2026-02-04) includes security fixes to the go command
  and the crypto/tls package, as well as bug fixes to the compiler and the
  crypto/x509 package. See the Go 1.25.7 milestone on our issue tracker for
  details:

  From the security mailing list:

  > Hello gophers,
  >
  > We have just released Go versions 1.25.7 and 1.24.13, minor point releases.
  >
  > These releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:
  >
  > - cmd/cgo: remove user-content from doc strings in cgo ASTs
  >
  >   A discrepancy between how Go and C/C++ comments
  >   were parsed allowed for code smuggling into the
  >   resulting cgo binary.
  >
  >   To prevent this behavior, the cgo compiler
  >   will no longer parse user-provided doc
  >   comments.
  >
  >   Thank you to RyotaK (https://ryotak.net) of
  >   GMO Flatt Security Inc. for reporting this issue.

  >   This is CVE-2025-61732 and https://go.dev/issue/76697.

  > - crypto/tls: unexpected session resumption when using Config.GetConfigForClient
  >
  >   Config.GetConfigForClient is documented to use the original Config's session
  >   ticket keys unless explicitly overridden. This can cause unexpected behavior if
  >   the returned Config modifies authentication parameters, like ClientCAs: a
  >   connection initially established with the parent (or a sibling) Config can be
  >   resumed, bypassing the modified authentication requirements.
  >
  >   If ClientAuth is VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert (on the
  >   server) or InsecureSkipVerify is false (on the client), crypto/tls now checks
  >   that the root of the previously-verified chain is still in ClientCAs/RootCAs
  >   when resuming a connection.
  >
  >   Go 1.26 Release Candidate 2, Go 1.25.6, and Go 1.24.12 had fixed a similar issue
  >   related to session ticket keys being implicitly shared by Config.Clone. Since
  >   this fix is broader, the Config.Clone behavior change has been reverted.
  >
  >   Note that VerifyPeerCertificate still behaves as documented: it does not apply
  >   to resumed connections. Applications that use Config.GetConfigForClient or
  >   Config.Clone and do not wish to blindly resume connections established with the
  >   original Config must use VerifyConnection instead (or SetSessionTicketKeys or
  >   SessionTicketsDisabled).
  >
  >   Thanks to Coia Prant (github.com/rbqvq) for reporting this issue.

  >   This updates CVE-2025-68121 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/77217.
