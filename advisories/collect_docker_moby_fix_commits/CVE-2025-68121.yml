  8f66e0c150a73bdeb5f14d01a1e62b4173ea2bbc:update to go1.25.7

  go1.25.7 (released 2026-02-04) includes security fixes to the go command
  and the crypto/tls package, as well as bug fixes to the compiler and the
  crypto/x509 package. See the Go 1.25.7 milestone on our issue tracker for
  details:
  https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.25.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved

  From the security mailing list:

  > Hello gophers,
  >
  > We have just released Go versions 1.25.7 and 1.24.13, minor point releases.
  >
  > These releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:
  >
  > - cmd/cgo: remove user-content from doc strings in cgo ASTs
  >
  >   A discrepancy between how Go and C/C++ comments
  >   were parsed allowed for code smuggling into the
  >   resulting cgo binary.
  >
  >   To prevent this behavior, the cgo compiler
  >   will no longer parse user-provided doc
  >   comments.
  >
  >   Thank you to RyotaK (https://ryotak.net) of
  >   GMO Flatt Security Inc. for reporting this issue.

  >
  > - crypto/tls: unexpected session resumption when using Config.GetConfigForClient
  >
  >   Config.GetConfigForClient is documented to use the original Config's session
  >   ticket keys unless explicitly overridden. This can cause unexpected behavior if
  >   the returned Config modifies authentication parameters, like ClientCAs: a
  >   connection initially established with the parent (or a sibling) Config can be
  >   resumed, bypassing the modified authentication requirements.
  >
  >   If ClientAuth is VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert (on the
  >   server) or InsecureSkipVerify is false (on the client), crypto/tls now checks
  >   that the root of the previously-verified chain is still in ClientCAs/RootCAs
  >   when resuming a connection.
  >
  >   Go 1.26 Release Candidate 2, Go 1.25.6, and Go 1.24.12 had fixed a similar issue
  >   related to session ticket keys being implicitly shared by Config.Clone. Since
  >   this fix is broader, the Config.Clone behavior change has been reverted.
  >
  >   Note that VerifyPeerCertificate still behaves as documented: it does not apply
  >   to resumed connections. Applications that use Config.GetConfigForClient or
  >   Config.Clone and do not wish to blindly resume connections established with the
  >   original Config must use VerifyConnection instead (or SetSessionTicketKeys or
  >   SessionTicketsDisabled).
  >
  >   Thanks to Coia Prant (github.com/rbqvq) for reporting this issue.

  480df696969c7a7c78a218c6e08cd333b2128dfe:update to go1.25.6

  This releases includes 6 security fixes following the security policy:

  - archive/zip: denial of service when parsing arbitrary ZIP archives

      archive/zip used a super-linear file name indexing algorithm that is invoked the first time a file in an archive is opened. This can lead to a denial of service when consuming a maliciously constructed ZIP archive.

      Thanks to Thanks to Jakub Ciolek for reporting this issue.

      This is CVE-2025-61728 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/77102.

  - net/http: memory exhaustion in Request.ParseForm

      When parsing a URL-encoded form net/http may allocate an unexpected amount of
      memory when provided a large number of key-value pairs. This can result in a
      denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

      Thanks to jub0bs for reporting this issue.

      This is CVE-2025-61726 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/77101.

  - crypto/tls: Config.Clone copies automatically generated session ticket keys, session resumption does not account for the expiration of full certificate chain

      The Config.Clone methods allows cloning a Config which has already been passed
      to a TLS function, allowing it to be mutated and reused.

      If Config.SessionTicketKey has not been set, and Config.SetSessionTicketKeys has
      not been called, crypto/tls will generate random session ticket keys and
      automatically rotate them. Config.Clone would copy these automatically generated
      keys into the returned Config, meaning that the two Configs would share session
      ticket keys, allowing sessions created using one Config could be used to resume
      sessions with the other Config. This can allow clients to resume sessions even
      though the Config may be configured such that they should not be able to do so.

      Config.Clone no longer copies the automatically generated session ticket keys.
      Config.Clone still copies keys which are explicitly provided, either by setting
      Config.SessionTicketKey or by calling Config.SetSessionTicketKeys.

      This issue was discoverd by the Go Security team while investigating another
      issue reported by Coia Prant (github.com/rbqvq).

      Additionally, on the server side only the expiration of the leaf certificate, if
      one was provided during the initial handshake, was checked when considering if a
      session could be resumed. This allowed sessions to be resumed if an intermediate
      or root certificate in the chain had expired.

      Session resumption now takes into account of the full chain when determining if
      the session can be resumed.

      Thanks to Coia Prant (github.com/rbqvq) for reporting this issue.

      This is CVE-2025-68121 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/77113.

  - cmd/go: bypass of flag sanitization can lead to arbitrary code execution

      Usage of 'CgoPkgConfig' allowed execution of the pkg-config
      binary with flags that are not explicitly safe-listed.

      To prevent this behavior, compiler flags resulting from usage
      of 'CgoPkgConfig' are sanitized prior to invoking pkg-config.

      Thank you to RyotaK (https://ryotak.net) of GMO Flatt Security Inc.
      for reporting this issue.

      This is CVE-2025-61731 and go.dev/issue/77100.

  - cmd/go: unexpected code execution when invoking toolchain

      The Go toolchain supports multiple VCS which are used retrieving modules and
      embedding build information into binaries.

      On systems with Mercurial installed (hg) downloading modules (e.g. via go get or
      go mod download) from non-standard sources (e.g. custom domains) can cause
      unexpected code execution due to how external VCS commands are constructed.

      On systems with Git installed, downloading and building modules with malicious
      version strings could allow an attacker to write to arbitrary files on the
      system the user has access to. This can only be triggered by explicitly
      providing the malicious version strings to the toolchain, and does not affect
      usage of @latest or bare module paths.

      The toolchain now uses safer VCS options to prevent misinterpretation of
      untrusted inputs. In addition, the toolchain now disallows module version
      strings prefixed with a "-" or "/" character.

      Thanks to splitline (@splitline) from DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this
      issue.

      This is CVE-2025-68119 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/77099.

  - crypto/tls: handshake messages may be processed at the incorrect encryption level

      During the TLS 1.3 handshake if multiple messages are sent in records that span
      encryption level boundaries (for instance the Client Hello and Encrypted
      Extensions messages), the subsequent messages may be processed before the
      encryption level changes. This can cause some minor information disclosure if a
      network-local attacker can inject messages during the handshake.

      Thanks to Coia Prant (github.com/rbqvq) for reporting this issue.
