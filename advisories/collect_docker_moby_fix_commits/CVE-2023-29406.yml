  net/http: insufficient sanitization of Host header

  The HTTP/1 client did not fully validate the contents of the Host header.
  A maliciously crafted Host header could inject additional headers or entire
  requests. The HTTP/1 client now refuses to send requests containing an
  invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.

  1603196c5bc3e3b826c841e599bc45fc33562633:pkg/plugins: use a dummy hostname for local connections

  For local communications (npipe://, unix://), the hostname is not used,
  but we need valid and meaningful hostname.

  The current code used the socket path as hostname, which gets rejected by
  go1.20.6 and go1.19.11 because of a security fix for [CVE-2023-29406 ][1],
  which was implemented in  https://go.dev/issue/60374.

  Prior versions go Go would clean the host header, and strip slashes in the
  process, but go1.20.6 and go1.19.11 no longer do, and reject the host
  header.

  Before this patch, tests would fail on go1.20.6:

  For local communications (npipe://, unix://), the hostname is not used,
  but we need valid and meaningful hostname.

  The current code used the client's `addr` as hostname in some cases, which
  could contain the path for the unix-socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`), which
  gets rejected by go1.20.6 and go1.19.11 because of a security fix for

  Prior versions go Go would clean the host header, and strip slashes in the
  process, but go1.20.6 and go1.19.11 no longer do, and reject the host
  header.

  This patch introduces a `DummyHost` const, and uses this dummy host for
  cases where we don't need an actual hostname.

  gets rejected by go1.20.6 and go1.19.11 because of a security fix for
  [CVE-2023-29406 ][1], which was implemented in  https://go.dev/issue/60374.

  Prior versions go Go would clean the host header, and strip slashes in the
  process, but go1.20.6 and go1.19.11 no longer do, and reject the host
  header.

  This patch introduces a `DummyHost` const, and uses this dummy host for
  cases where we don't need an actual hostname.

  Before this patch (using go1.20.6):

      make GO_VERSION=1.20.6 TEST_FILTER=TestAttach test-integration
      === RUN   TestAttachWithTTY
          attach_test.go:46: assertion failed: error is not nil: http: invalid Host header
      --- FAIL: TestAttachWithTTY (0.11s)
      === RUN   TestAttachWithoutTTy
          attach_test.go:46: assertion failed: error is not nil: http: invalid Host header
      --- FAIL: TestAttachWithoutTTy (0.02s)
      FAIL

  With this patch applied:

      make GO_VERSION=1.20.6 TEST_FILTER=TestAttach test-integration
      INFO: Testing against a local daemon
      === RUN   TestAttachWithTTY
      --- PASS: TestAttachWithTTY (0.12s)
      === RUN   TestAttachWithoutTTy
      --- PASS: TestAttachWithoutTTy (0.02s)
      PASS
