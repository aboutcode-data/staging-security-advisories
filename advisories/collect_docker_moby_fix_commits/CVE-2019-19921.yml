  40ec0eb9fe21d5fe8a9e98c8aa26e49a442f6036:vendor: github.com/opencontainers/runc v1.1.5

  no changes in vendored code, just keeping scanners happy :)

  release notes: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.5
  diff: https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/compare/v1.1.4...v1.1.5

  This is the fifth patch release in the 1.1.z series of runc, which fixes
  three CVEs found in runc.

  * CVE-2023-25809 is a vulnerability involving rootless containers where
    (under specific configurations), the container would have write access
    to the /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/... cgroup hierarchy. No other
    hierarchies on the host were affected. This vulnerability was
    discovered by Akihiro Suda.
    <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-m8cg-xc2p-r3fc>

  * CVE-2023-27561 was a regression which effectively re-introduced
    CVE-2019-19921. This bug was present from v1.0.0-rc95 to v1.1.4. This
    regression was discovered by @Beuc.
    <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vpvm-3wq2-2wvm>

  * CVE-2023-28642 is a variant of CVE-2023-27561 and was fixed by the same
    patch. This variant of the above vulnerability was reported by Lei
    Wang.
    <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c>

  In addition, the following other fixes are included in this release:

  * Fix the inability to use `/dev/null` when inside a container.
  * Fix changing the ownership of host's `/dev/null` caused by fd redirection
    (a regression in 1.1.1).
  * Fix rare runc exec/enter unshare error on older kernels, including
    CentOS < 7.7.
  * nsexec: Check for errors in `write_log()`.
