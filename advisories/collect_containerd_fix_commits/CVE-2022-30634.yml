  5c9c83d3e0f03d86644c448d23dc67c7433a2410:[release/1.6] update golang to 1.17.11

  go1.17.11 (released 2022-06-01) includes security fixes to the crypto/rand,
  crypto/tls, os/exec, and path/filepath packages, as well as bug fixes to the
  crypto/tls package. See the Go 1.17.11 milestone on our issue tracker for details.

  https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.17.11+label%3ACherryPickApproved

  Hello gophers,

  We have just released Go versions 1.18.3 and 1.17.11, minor point releases.

  These minor releases include 4 security fixes following the security policy:

  - crypto/rand: rand.Read hangs with extremely large buffers
    On Windows, rand.Read will hang indefinitely if passed a buffer larger than
    1 << 32 - 1 bytes.

    Thanks to Davis Goodin and Quim Muntal, working at Microsoft on the Go toolset,
    for reporting this issue.

    This is [CVE-2022-30634][CVE-2022-30634] and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/52561.
  - crypto/tls: session tickets lack random ticket_age_add
    Session tickets generated by crypto/tls did not contain a randomly generated
    ticket_age_add. This allows an attacker that can observe TLS handshakes to
    correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session
    resumption.

    Thanks to GitHub user nervuri for reporting this.

    This is [CVE-2022-30629][CVE-2022-30629] and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/52814.
  - `os/exec`: empty `Cmd.Path` can result in running unintended binary on Windows

    If, on Windows, `Cmd.Run`, `cmd.Start`, `cmd.Output`, or `cmd.CombinedOutput`
    are executed when Cmd.Path is unset and, in the working directory, there are
    binaries named either "..com" or "..exe", they will be executed.

    Thanks to Chris Darroch, brian m. carlson, and Mikhail Shcherbakov for reporting
    this.

    This is [CVE-2022-30580][CVE-2022-30580] and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/52574.
  - `path/filepath`: Clean(`.\c:`) returns `c:` on Windows

    On Windows, the `filepath.Clean` function could convert an invalid path to a
    valid, absolute path. For example, Clean(`.\c:`) returned `c:`.

  - `path/filepath`: Clean(`.\c:`) returns `c:` on Windows

    On Windows, the `filepath.Clean` function could convert an invalid path to a
    valid, absolute path. For example, Clean(`.\c:`) returned `c:`.

  go1.18.3 (released 2022-06-01) includes security fixes to the crypto/rand,
  crypto/tls, os/exec, and path/filepath packages, as well as bug fixes to the
  compiler, and the crypto/tls and text/template/parse packages. See the Go
  1.18.3 milestone on our issue tracker for details:

  crypto/tls, os/exec, and path/filepath packages, as well as bug fixes to the
  crypto/tls package. See the Go 1.17.11 milestone on our issue tracker for details.

  https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.17.11+label%3ACherryPickApproved

  Hello gophers,

  We have just released Go versions 1.18.3 and 1.17.11, minor point releases.

  These minor releases include 4 security fixes following the security policy:

  - crypto/rand: rand.Read hangs with extremely large buffers
    On Windows, rand.Read will hang indefinitely if passed a buffer larger than
    1 << 32 - 1 bytes.

    Thanks to Davis Goodin and Quim Muntal, working at Microsoft on the Go toolset,
    for reporting this issue.

    This is [CVE-2022-30634][CVE-2022-30634] and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/52561.
  - crypto/tls: session tickets lack random ticket_age_add
    Session tickets generated by crypto/tls did not contain a randomly generated
    ticket_age_add. This allows an attacker that can observe TLS handshakes to
    correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session
    resumption.

    Thanks to GitHub user nervuri for reporting this.

    This is [CVE-2022-30629][CVE-2022-30629] and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/52814.
  - `os/exec`: empty `Cmd.Path` can result in running unintended binary on Windows

    If, on Windows, `Cmd.Run`, `cmd.Start`, `cmd.Output`, or `cmd.CombinedOutput`
    are executed when Cmd.Path is unset and, in the working directory, there are
    binaries named either "..com" or "..exe", they will be executed.

    Thanks to Chris Darroch, brian m. carlson, and Mikhail Shcherbakov for reporting
    this.
