  951af274c4154f353a624b8004c400d6aed13088:update to go1.22.7, go1.23.1

  - https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.27.7+label%3ACherryPickApproved
  - full diff: https://github.com/golang/go/compare/go1.22.6...go1.22.7

  These minor releases include 3 security fixes following the security policy:

  - go/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse* functions

      Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains
      deeply nested literals can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

      This is CVE-2024-34155 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/69138.

  - encoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode

      Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested
      structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

      This is a follow-up to CVE-2022-30635.

      Thanks to Md Sakib Anwar of The Ohio State University for reporting
      this issue.

      This is CVE-2024-34156 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/69139.

  - go/build/constraint: stack exhaustion in Parse

      Calling Parse on a "// +build" build tag line with deeply nested
      expressions can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

      This is CVE-2024-34158 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/69141.
