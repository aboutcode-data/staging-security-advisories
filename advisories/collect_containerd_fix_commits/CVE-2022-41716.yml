  e1a2bb0ee51594dadff93f740cdb76d5affe614a:Merge pull request #7633 from thaJeztah/1.5_bump_go1.18.8

  [release/1.5] update to Go 1.18.8 to address CVE-2022-41716
  f69fbace7c2b24bf3fa84279aef4ae6fc11b6c66:Merge pull request #7634 from thaJeztah/1.6_bump_go1.18.8

  [release/1.6] update to Go 1.18.8 to address CVE-2022-41716
  9d9bd10b462c099a7e2cd028da5b8d65cd6f5f35:[release/1.5] update to Go 1.18.8 to address CVE-2022-41716

      On Windows, syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd did not properly
      check for invalid environment variable values. A malicious
      environment variable value could exploit this behavior to set a
      value for a different environment variable. For example, the
      environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D" set the variables "A=B" and
      "C=D".

      Thanks to RyotaK (https://twitter.com/ryotkak) for reporting this
      issue.

      This is CVE-2022-41716 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/56284.

  This Go release also fixes https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56309, a
  runtime bug which can cause random memory corruption when a goroutine
  exits with runtime.LockOSThread() set. This fix is necessary to unblock
  work to replace certain uses of pkg/reexec with unshared OS threads.
