  ea9a8c608404d421c481d9bddd4f9a56c20762f0:update to go1.21.9, go1.22.2

  go1.21.9 (released 2024-04-03) includes a security fix to the net/http
  package, as well as bug fixes to the linker, and the go/types and
  net/http packages. See the Go 1.21.9 milestone for more details;
  https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.21.9+label%3ACherryPickApproved

  These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the security policy:

  - http2: close connections when receiving too many headers

  Maintaining HPACK state requires that we parse and process all HEADERS
  and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed
  MaxHeaderBytes, we don't allocate memory to store the excess headers but
  we do parse them. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint
  to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request
  which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded
  data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode
  than for an attacker to send.

  Set a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before
  closing a connection.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski (https://nowotarski.info/) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-45288 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/65051.
