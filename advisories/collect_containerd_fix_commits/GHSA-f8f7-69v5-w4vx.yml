  net/http: insufficient sanitization of Host header

  The HTTP/1 client did not fully validate the contents of the Host header.
  A maliciously crafted Host header could inject additional headers or entire
  requests. The HTTP/1 client now refuses to send requests containing an
  invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.

  Includes security fixes for [CVE-2023-29406 ][1] and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/60374
