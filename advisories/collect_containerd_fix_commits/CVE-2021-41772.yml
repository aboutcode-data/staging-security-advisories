  go1.16.10 (released 2021-11-04) includes security fixes to the archive/zip and
  debug/macho packages, as well as bug fixes to the compiler, linker, runtime, the
  misc/wasm directory, and to the net/http package. See the Go 1.16.10 milestone
  for details: https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.16.10+label%3ACherryPickApproved

  From the announcement e-mail:

  [security] Go 1.17.3 and Go 1.16.10 are released

  We have just released Go versions 1.17.3 and 1.16.10, minor point releases.
  These minor releases include two security fixes following the security policy:

  - archive/zip: don't panic on (*Reader).Open
    Reader.Open (the API implementing io/fs.FS introduced in Go 1.16) can be made
    to panic by an attacker providing either a crafted ZIP archive containing
    completely invalid names or an empty filename argument.
    Thank you to Colin Arnott, SiteHost and Noah Santschi-Cooney, Sourcegraph Code
    Intelligence Team for reporting this issue. This is CVE-2021-41772 and Go issue
    golang.org/issue/48085.
  - debug/macho: invalid dynamic symbol table command can cause panic
    Malformed binaries parsed using Open or OpenFat can cause a panic when calling
    ImportedSymbols, due to an out-of-bounds slice operation.
    Thanks to Burak Çarıkçı - Yunus Yıldırım (CT-Zer0 Crypttech) for reporting this
    issue. This is CVE-2021-41771 and Go issue golang.org/issue/48990.
