  4ffef752d0bb5b41488848d617c21759fd29b31e:update golang to 1.18.4, 1.17.12

  go1.18.4 (released 2022-07-12) includes security fixes to the compress/gzip,
  encoding/gob, encoding/xml, go/parser, io/fs, net/http, and path/filepath
  packages, as well as bug fixes to the compiler, the go command, the linker,
  the runtime, and the runtime/metrics package. See the Go 1.18.4 milestone on the
  issue tracker for details:

  https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=milestone%3AGo1.18.4+label%3ACherryPickApproved

  This update addresses:

  CVE-2022-1705, CVE-2022-1962, CVE-2022-28131, CVE-2022-30630, CVE-2022-30631,
  CVE-2022-30632, CVE-2022-30633, CVE-2022-30635, and CVE-2022-32148.

  Full diff: https://github.com/golang/go/compare/go1.18.3...go1.18.4

  From the security announcement;
  https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/nqrv9fbR0zE

  We have just released Go versions 1.18.4 and 1.17.12, minor point releases. These
  minor releases include 9 security fixes following the security policy:

  - net/http: improper sanitization of Transfer-Encoding header

    The HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as indicating
    a "chunked" encoding. This could potentially allow for request smuggling, but
    only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly failed to
    reject the header as invalid.

    This is CVE-2022-1705 and https://go.dev/issue/53188.

  - When `httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP` was called with a `Request.Header` map
    containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy would set
    the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to its
    documentation. In the more usual case where a Director function set the
    X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy would leave the header
    unmodified as expected.

    This is https://go.dev/issue/53423 and CVE-2022-32148.

    Thanks to Christian Mehlmauer for reporting this issue.

  - compress/gzip: stack exhaustion in Reader.Read

    Calling Reader.Read on an archive containing a large number of concatenated
    0-length compressed files can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

    This is CVE-2022-30631 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/53168.

  - encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Unmarshal

    Calling Unmarshal on a XML document into a Go struct which has a nested field
    that uses the any field tag can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

    This is CVE-2022-30633 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/53611.

  - encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Skip

    Calling Decoder.Skip when parsing a deeply nested XML document can cause a
    panic due to stack exhaustion. The Go Security team discovered this issue, and
    it was independently reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost.

    This is CVE-2022-28131 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/53614.

  - encoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode

    Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures
    can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

    This is CVE-2022-30635 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/53615.

  - path/filepath: stack exhaustion in Glob

    Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can
    cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

    Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

    This is CVE-2022-30632 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/53416.

  - io/fs: stack exhaustion in Glob

    Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can
    cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

    This is CVE-2022-30630 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/53415.

  - go/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse* functions

    Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply
    nested types or declarations can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

    Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

    This is CVE-2022-1962 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/53616.
