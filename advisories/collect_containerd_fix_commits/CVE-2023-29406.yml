  - net/http: insufficient sanitization of Host header

  The HTTP/1 client did not fully validate the contents of the Host header.
  A maliciously crafted Host header could inject additional headers or
  entire requests. The HTTP/1 client now refuses to send requests containing
  an invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.
