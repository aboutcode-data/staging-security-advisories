  update to the latest version of this dependency, which has a fix for a
  authorization bypass in the ssh package. We don't use this functionality,
  so there's no need to backport this change (other than de-noising false positives).

  This is CVE-2024-45337 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/70779.
