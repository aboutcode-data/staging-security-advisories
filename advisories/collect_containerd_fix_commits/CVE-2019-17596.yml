  -------------------------------

  syscall and net packages. See the Go 1.12.12 milestone on our issue tracker for
  details.

  [security] Go 1.13.2 and Go 1.12.11 are released

  Hi gophers,

  We have just released Go 1.13.2 and Go 1.12.11 to address a recently reported
  security issue. We recommend that all affected users update to one of these
  releases (if you're not sure which, choose Go 1.13.2).

  Invalid DSA public keys can cause a panic in dsa.Verify. In particular, using
  crypto/x509.Verify on a crafted X.509 certificate chain can lead to a panic,
  even if the certificates don't chain to a trusted root. The chain can be
  delivered via a crypto/tls connection to a client, or to a server that accepts
  and verifies client certificates. net/http clients can be made to crash by an
  HTTPS server, while net/http servers that accept client certificates will
  recover the panic and are unaffected.

  Moreover, an application might crash invoking
  crypto/x509.(*CertificateRequest).CheckSignature on an X.509 certificate
  request, parsing a golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp Entity, or during a
  golang.org/x/crypto/otr conversation. Finally, a golang.org/x/crypto/ssh client
  can panic due to a malformed host key, while a server could panic if either
  PublicKeyCallback accepts a malformed public key, or if IsUserAuthority accepts
  a certificate with a malformed public key.

  The issue is CVE-2019-17596 and Go issue golang.org/issue/34960.

  Thanks to Daniel Mandragona for discovering and reporting this issue. We'd also
  like to thank regilero for a previous disclosure of CVE-2019-16276.

  The Go 1.13.2 release also includes a fix to the compiler that prevents improper
  access to negative slice indexes in rare cases. Affected code, in which the
  compiler can prove that the index is zero or negative, would have resulted in a
  panic in Go 1.12, but could have led to arbitrary memory read and writes in Go
  1.13 and Go 1.13.1. This is Go issue golang.org/issue/34802.

  Hi gophers,

  We have just released Go 1.13.2 and Go 1.12.11 to address a recently reported
  security issue. We recommend that all affected users update to one of these
  releases (if you're not sure which, choose Go 1.13.2).

  Invalid DSA public keys can cause a panic in dsa.Verify. In particular, using
  crypto/x509.Verify on a crafted X.509 certificate chain can lead to a panic,
  even if the certificates don't chain to a trusted root. The chain can be
  delivered via a crypto/tls connection to a client, or to a server that accepts
  and verifies client certificates. net/http clients can be made to crash by an
  HTTPS server, while net/http servers that accept client certificates will
  recover the panic and are unaffected.

  Moreover, an application might crash invoking
  crypto/x509.(*CertificateRequest).CheckSignature on an X.509 certificate
  request, parsing a golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp Entity, or during a
  golang.org/x/crypto/otr conversation. Finally, a golang.org/x/crypto/ssh client
  can panic due to a malformed host key, while a server could panic if either
  PublicKeyCallback accepts a malformed public key, or if IsUserAuthority accepts
  a certificate with a malformed public key.

  The issue is CVE-2019-17596 and Go issue golang.org/issue/34960.

  Thanks to Daniel Mandragona for discovering and reporting this issue. We'd also
  like to thank regilero for a previous disclosure of CVE-2019-16276.

  The Go 1.13.2 release also includes a fix to the compiler that prevents improper
  access to negative slice indexes in rare cases. Affected code, in which the
  compiler can prove that the index is zero or negative, would have resulted in a
  panic in Go 1.12, but could have led to arbitrary memory read and writes in Go
  1.13 and Go 1.13.1. This is Go issue golang.org/issue/34802.
