  8e6a9de5b5291b97684e948be096317611b37930:update to go1.20.7, go1.19.12

  Includes a fix for CVE-2023-29409

  go1.20.7 (released 2023-08-01) includes a security fix to the crypto/tls
  package, as well as bug fixes to the assembler and the compiler. See the
  Go 1.20.7 milestone on our issue tracker for details:

  - full diff: https://github.com/golang/go/compare/go1.20.6...go1.20.7

  go1.19.12 (released 2023-08-01) includes a security fix to the crypto/tls
  package, as well as bug fixes to the assembler and the compiler. See the
  Go 1.19.12 milestone on our issue tracker for details.

  From the mailing list announcement:

  [security] Go 1.20.7 and Go 1.19.12 are released

  Hello gophers,

  We have just released Go versions 1.20.7 and 1.19.12, minor point releases.

  These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the security policy:

  - crypto/tls: restrict RSA keys in certificates to <= 8192 bits

    Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server
    to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. Limit this by
    restricting the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes to <=
    8192 bits.

    Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only
    three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all
    three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It
    is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target
    the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the
    default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.

    Thanks to Mateusz Poliwczak for reporting this issue.
