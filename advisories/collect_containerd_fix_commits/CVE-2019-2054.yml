  e224f77eb7b4bd062485d6b0a3b8ba7181861bca:Add process_vm read and write calls to default seccomp profile

  Follow up to 94faa70df4d78538605bb492010954a7e3bec67a. The commit referenced allowed `ptrace` calls in the default seccomp profile following the usual tracing security checks in for Kernels newer than 4.8. Kernels prior to this version are susceptible to [CVE-2019-2054](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qgfr-27qf-f323).  Moby's default had allowed for `ptrace` for kernels newer than 4.8 at the time the commit was created. The current [seccomp default](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default_linux.go#L405-L417) has been updated to include `process_vm_read` and `process_vm_write`. Mirror that policy to complete the classic ptrace set of APIs.
