  8f2bbd5e8f53faaf74a9806786b48cf081d4fe9b:Update to go 1.19.1, 1.18.6 to address CVE-2022-27664, CVE-2022-32190

  From the mailing list:

  We have just released Go versions 1.19.1 and 1.18.6, minor point releases.
  These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:

  - net/http: handle server errors after sending GOAWAY
    A closing HTTP/2 server connection could hang forever waiting for a clean
    shutdown that was preempted by a subsequent fatal error. This failure mode
    could be exploited to cause a denial of service.

    Thanks to Bahruz Jabiyev, Tommaso Innocenti, Anthony Gavazzi, Steven Sprecher,
    and Kaan Onarlioglu for reporting this.

    This is CVE-2022-27664 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/54658.

  - net/url: JoinPath does not strip relative path components in all circumstances
    JoinPath and URL.JoinPath would not remove `../` path components appended to a
    relative path. For example, `JoinPath("https://go.dev", "../go")` returned the
    URL `https://go.dev/../go`, despite the JoinPath documentation stating that
    `../` path elements are cleaned from the result.

    Thanks to q0jt for reporting this issue.

    This is CVE-2022-32190 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/54385.

  Release notes:

  go1.19.1 (released 2022-09-06) includes security fixes to the net/http and
  net/url packages, as well as bug fixes to the compiler, the go command, the pprof
  command, the linker, the runtime, and the crypto/tls and crypto/x509 packages.
  See the Go 1.19.1 milestone on the issue tracker for details.
