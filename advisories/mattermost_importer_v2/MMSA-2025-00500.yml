  - CVE-2025-36530
summary: (CWE-74) Fixed an issue where a path-traversal vulnerability in the import functionality
  allowed restricted system admin users (an experimental configuration option) to bypass plugin
  signature enforcement and marketplace restrictions, install custom unsigned plugins, and potentially
  achieve remote code execution. Thanks to  Dawid Kulikowski (daw10) for contributing to this
  improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
