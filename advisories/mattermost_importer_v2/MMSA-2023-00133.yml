summary: (Information Disclosure) Fixed an issue where an authenticated user with team admin
  privileges could view the team owner email address by invoking the “Regenerate invite ID”
  API endpoint at /api/v4/teams/[teamId]/regenerate_invite_id, which failed to honor the ShowEmailAddress
  setting. The ShowEmailAddress setting, when set to False, hides email addresses to all members
  except system administrators. Thanks to foobar7 for contributing to this improvement under
  the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
