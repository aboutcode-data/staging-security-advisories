  - CVE-2024-39613
summary: (CWE-427) Fixed an issue where the Windows Desktop app failed to use an absolute path
  when searching the cmd.exe file, which allowed a local attacker who was able to put an cmd.exe
  file in the Downloads folder of a user's machine to cause remote code execution on that machine.
