summary: (CWE-284) Fixed an issue where no authentication method other than the email/password
  one was forbidding a remote user from joining. This issue was not exploitable on its own,
  but could be chained with other vulnerabilities. Thanks to Juho Forsén for contributing to
  this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
