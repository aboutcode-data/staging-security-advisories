summary: (Information Disclosure) Fixed an issue where an authenticated user with team admin
  privileges could view the team owner email address by calling the /api/v4/users/me/teams API
  endpoint as the ShowEmailAddress setting was not honored by said endpoint. The ShowEmailAddress
  setting, when set to False, hides email addresses to all members except system administrators.
  Thanks to foobar7 for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure
  policy.
