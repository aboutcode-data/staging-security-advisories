  - CVE-2025-22445
summary: (CWE-284) Fixed an issue where when the setting was missing (e.g. new installation),
  the admin console UI would incorrectly report it as disabled (false) since it was undefined,
  although the the setting was enabled, since that is the default value. This could cause confusion
  on the state of a possibly security-sensitive configuration option in Calls. Thanks to Leandro
  Chaves  for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
