summary: (CWE-200) Fixed an issue where a member could get the full name of another user even
  if the Show Full Name option was disabled by sending a request to /plugins/focalboard/api/v2/users/<user_id>?teamID=<team_id>&channelID=<channel_id>.
  Thanks to Pyae Phyo for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible
  disclosure policy.
