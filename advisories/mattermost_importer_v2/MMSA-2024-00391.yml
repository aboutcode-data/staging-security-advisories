  - CVE-2025-35965
summary: (CWE-400) Fixed an issue in the Playbooks plugin where the UpdateRunTaskActions GraphQL
  operation did not properly validate the uniqueness or quantity of task actions, allowing users
  to create an excessive number of actions on task items, which could result in denial-of-service
  (DoS) by crashing the application server. Thanks to vultza for contributing to this improvement
  under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
