  - CVE-2025-41436
summary: (CWE-284) Fixed an issue where users could access archived channel content and files
  through the threads interface even when the "Allow users to view archived channels" setting
  was disabled by the system administrator. This setting has been retired and viewing archived
  channels is now the expected behavior. Thanks to BhaRat (hackit_bharat) for contributing to
  this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
