  - CVE-2025-4981
summary: (CWE-427) Fixed a path traversal vulnerability in the document extraction functionality
  that could be used to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, potentially leading
  to remote code execution. It could be exploited by any authenticated user by uploading an
  archive with specially crafted filenames. The vulnerability impacts instances where file uploads
  and document search by content are enabled (FileSettings.EnableFileAttachments = true and
  FileSettings.ExtractContent = true). These configuration settings are enabled by default.
  Thanks to Dawid Kulikowski (daw10) for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost
