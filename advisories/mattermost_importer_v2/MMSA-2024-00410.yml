summary: (CWE-284) Fixed an issue where a user without access to the AI bot could trigger the
  bot by using Wrangler to attach the activate_ai override prop to the post. This can be achieved
  only if both AI and Wrangler Mattermost plugins are enabled. Thanks to Juho Forsén for contributing
  to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
