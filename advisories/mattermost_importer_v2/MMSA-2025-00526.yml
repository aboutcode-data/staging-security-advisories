  - CVE-2025-12559
summary: (CWE-200) Fixed an issue where the GET /api/v4/channels/{channel_id}/common_teams endpoint
  did not sanitize team email addresses to be visible only to Team Admins which allowed any
  authenticated user to view team email addresses. Thanks to hainguyen0207 for contributing
  to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
