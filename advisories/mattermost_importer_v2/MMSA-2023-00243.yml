summary: (CWE-200) Fixed an issue where the WebSocket would broadcast the information about
  who was notified about a post to everyone else in the channel, by introducing hooks that would
  scope the response to a specific user. Thanks to Daniel Espino Garcia for contributing to
  this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
