  - CVE-2025-54478
summary: (CWE-287) Fixed an issue where the Edit Channel Subscription endpoint allows unauthenticated
  access, allowing any user to update channel subscription without checking ‘mattermost-user-id’
  from the request header. This vulnerability is only exposed when accessing the API endpoint
  from an external source and cannot be exploited through the UI. Thanks to Lorenzo Gallegos
  for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
