  - CVE-2025-27538
summary: (CWE-287) Fixed an issue where MFA where MFA enforcement was not applied in PUT /api/v4/users/user-id/mfa
  when the requesting user differed from the target user ID. This allowed users with the edit_other_users
  permission to activate or deactivate MFA for other users, even if those users hadn't set up
  MFA themselves. Thanks to 0x7oda7123 for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost
  responsible disclosure policy.
