summary: (CWE-200) Fixed an issue where a member could get the full name of another user even
  if the Show Full Name option was disabled by sending a request to /api/v4/teams/<team_ID>/top/team_members?page=0&per_page=10&time_range=28_day.
  Thanks to Hack Cats for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible
  disclosure policy.
