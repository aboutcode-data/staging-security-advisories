  - CVE-2025-27715
summary: (CWE-284) Fixed an issue where team admins were automatically added to a private channel
  when clicking on its permalink, instead of being shown a warning modal informing them that
  they were about to join a private channel without explicit approval from the channel admin.
  Thanks to Joram Wilander for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible
  disclosure policy.
