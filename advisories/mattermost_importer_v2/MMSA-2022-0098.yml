summary: (Reducing Attack Surface) Fixed an issue where users with Plugin Management permissions
  were allowed to bypass the restriction and upload any custom plugins, even when the upload
  plugin config was disabled in the server’s config.json file. Thanks to Rohitesh Gupta for
  contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
