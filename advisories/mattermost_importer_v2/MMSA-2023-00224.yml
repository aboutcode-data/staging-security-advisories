summary: (CWE-400) Fixed an issue where an attacker could send a really long value for a notification_prop
  in the /api/v4/channels/<channel-id>/members/<user-id>/notify_props resulting in the server
  consuming an abnormal quantity of computing resources and possibly becoming temporarily unavailable
  for its users. Thanks to vulza for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible
  disclosure policy.
