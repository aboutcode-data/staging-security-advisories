summary: (CWE-284) Fixed an issue where, if settings allowed integrations to override the username
  and profile picture when posting, a member could also override the username and Icon when
  making a post even if the Hardened Mode setting was enabled. Thanks to Eva Sarafianou for
  contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
