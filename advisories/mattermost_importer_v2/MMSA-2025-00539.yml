  - CVE-2025-12689
summary: (CWE-754) Fixed an issue where the websocket request field was not checked for proper
  UTF-8 format. Each request is sent to Prometheus metrics by plugin; malformed UTF-8 caused
  Prometheus to panic resulting in plug-in crashing. Thanks to National Security Agency for
  contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
