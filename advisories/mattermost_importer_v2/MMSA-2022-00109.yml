summary: (Reducing Attack Surface) Fixed an issue with the default config generation for trusted
  IP header, which could allow attackers to bypass some of the rate limitations in place or
  use manipulated IPs for audit logging via manipulating the request headers. Thanks to Adam
  Pritchard for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure
  policy.
