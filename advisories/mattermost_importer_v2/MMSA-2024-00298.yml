  - CVE-2024-5272
summary: (CWE-284) Fixed an issue where a guest, who's in a channel with a playbook run that
  they don't have access to, could get access to details of the playbook run due to a webhook
  event being broadcasted to everyone in the channel when the run is marked as finished. Thanks
  to BhaRat for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure
  policy.
