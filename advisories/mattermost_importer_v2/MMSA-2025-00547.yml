  - CVE-2025-12419
summary: '(CWE-287) Fixed an issue where OAuth state tokens were not properly validated during
  OpenID Connect authentication, allowing an authenticated attacker with team creation privileges
  to take over user accounts by manipulating authentication data. This required email verification
  to be disabled (default: disabled), OAuth/OpenID Connect to be enabled, and the attacker to
  control two users in the SSO system with one of them never having logged into Mattermost.
  Thanks to daw10 for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure
  policy.'
