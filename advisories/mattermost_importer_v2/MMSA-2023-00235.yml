summary: (CWE-200) Fixed an issue where the Desktop App would default to the “Silly” logging
  level, potentially exposing all of the user’s keystrokes and filling up the user’s hard drive
  quickly. Thanks to Patrice Kolb for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost
  responsible disclosure policy.
