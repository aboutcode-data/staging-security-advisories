summary: (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component
  (‘Injection’)) Fixed an issue in the GitHub plugin where posting a specially crafted message
  with a link to contents of a Github private repository would result in the private code being
  previewed in Mattermost even if the configuration settings allowed preview only for public
  repositories. Thanks to Juho Nurminen for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost
  responsible disclosure policy.
