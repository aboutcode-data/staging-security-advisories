  - CVE-2025-13523
summary: (CWE-79) Fixed an issue where user-controlled display names from Confluence were not
  properly sanitized when rendered in the OAuth2 account connection flow, allowing authenticated
  Confluence users to set malicious display names and send a crafted connection link to other
  users that would execute arbitrary JavaScript in their browsers when visited. Thanks to daw10
  for contributing to this improvement under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy.
