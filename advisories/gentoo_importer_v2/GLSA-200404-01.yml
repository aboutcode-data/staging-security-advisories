summary: |
  A flaw has been found in the temporary file handling algorithms for the
      sandboxing code used within Portage. Lockfiles created during normal Portage
      operation of portage could be manipulated by local users resulting in the
      truncation of hard linked files; causing a Denial of Service attack on
      the system.
