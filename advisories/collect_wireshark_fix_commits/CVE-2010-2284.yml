summary: |
  041cd31c9ed1d265b344872278ca1928918e5863:Revert get_ber_length() back to r32530, which removes all of the changes
  back to and including my attempt to make it iterative. Move its guts
  back into try_get_ber_length() and add a recursion level check.

  This should fix CVE-2010-2284 and preserve existing behavior without
  introducing any new regressions (such as bug 5000).
