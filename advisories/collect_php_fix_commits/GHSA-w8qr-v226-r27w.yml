  5c6d47372cff9ac01113763cce5bdc097bb90f33:Fix GHSA-w8qr-v226-r27w

  We should not early-out with success status if we found an ipv6
  hostname, we should keep checking the rest of the conditions.
  Because integrating the if-check of the ipv6 hostname in the
  "Validate domain" if-check made the code hard to read, I extracted the
  condition out to a separate function. This also required to make
  a few pointers const in order to have some clean code.
