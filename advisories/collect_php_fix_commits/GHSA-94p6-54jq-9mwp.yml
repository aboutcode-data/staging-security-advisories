  61c8b7851b68aa5e8c2b2cfe9f35ba9107d171be:Fix GHSA-94p6-54jq-9mwp

  Apache only generates REDIRECT_STATUS, so explicitly check for that
  if the server name is Apache, don't allow other variable names.
  Furthermore, redirect.so and Netscape no longer exist, so
  remove those entries as we can't check their server name anymore.

  We now also check for the configuration override *first* such that it
  always take precedence. This would allow for a mitigation path if
  something like this happens in the future.
