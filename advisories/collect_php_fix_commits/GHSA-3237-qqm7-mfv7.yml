  c5f28c7cf0a052f48e47877c7aa5c5bcc54f1cfc:Fix GH-20584: Information Leak of Memory

  The string added had uninitialized memory due to
  php_read_stream_all_chunks() not moving the buffer position, resulting
  in the same data always being overwritten instead of new data being
  added to the end of the buffer.

  This is backport as there is a security impact as described in
  GHSA-3237-qqm7-mfv7 .
