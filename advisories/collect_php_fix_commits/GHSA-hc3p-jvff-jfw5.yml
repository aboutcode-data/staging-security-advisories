summary: "11d701a6abc86e51ce09aaa5c6f55019e54c2bb2:Port fix for libgd bug 447 (GH-17320)\n\n\
  That bug has been potentially exploitable[1], but the GD extension was\r\nnot affected by\
  \ that, because `gdImageBmpPtr()` is never called.  Still\r\nit seems to be reasonable to\
  \ port the fix; if only to keep bundled and\r\nexternal libgd synced.\r\n\r\n[1] <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hc3p-jvff-jfw5>"
